0,You Can't Comply Your Way out of Censorship -- Whisper Has Been Banned,416,uybakv,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/uybakv/you_cant_comply_your_way_out_of_censorship/,87,"We've known about the specter of censorship as long as we've been talking about The Red Pill. Censorship and forbidden knowledge go hand-in-hand. Knowledge cannot be forbidden without at least the threat of soft-censorship- the idea that sharing these unspeakable truths would end you in financial and social ruin. But hard censorship, deleting words off pages and outlawing words and contexts, this was always on the horizon and something we knew was a long time coming.

That's why over half a decade ago we invested in an off-site platform that would not only [archive the best of TRP](https://forums.red/i/theredpill) but also provide a [life raft and meeting place](https://trp.red) for members to continue to connect, to maintain connections, and to communicate freely, despite what every other platform tries to do.

Reddit was never going to be able to be a forever home for us. And this reality is becoming more clear by the day. After multiple mods were banned on askTRP, we made the hard decision to lock the forum and move it to https://www.forums.red/i/asktrp. We got some pushback when we did that, but the truth is, there’s more to the red pill than simply where we live and what app you use. My biggest priority during my time here was to prevent border erosion and protect the discussion. And this simply cannot continue happening on Reddit.

It started as something simple- a request. Don’t use the F word. Don’t use the R word. You can say what you’re saying but tone down the language. We implement rules for this. Then it becomes: You can’t have a frank discussion about difficulties of dating within certain cultures or ethnicities. Eventually, it became: You can’t have that specific sexual preference; you’re not allowed to prefer women without dicks **or even differentiate between them**. You can’t have that opinion; you’re not allowed to think that way. Eventually, you’re really only allowed to say specific things, *and here’s the list.*

One of Reddit's content policy rules was directly implemented to counter some of our posts. I can't even tell you the entire topic that has to be censored here, but you can find it on trp.red!

This is no way to preserve a discussion. This is no way to communicate. And this is no way to become a man who does and gets what he pleases. This is the road, paved with small concessions, to surrender all ground to the feminine imperative and cede the red pill in favor of the new, improved purple pill that takes blue pill feminism, gaslights you into thinking *we’ve always known that* about sexual dynamics, and *can’t you just improve yourself without all those darn wrong opinions and misogyny?*

And there it is. They recognized they couldn’t destroy TRP by simply removing it or banning it. So they decided to invade a male space, change it from the inside while slowly changing the rules and delivering it a thousand cuts to finally finish it off.

From a post I made 6 years ago, [The Viability of the Red Pill in the Future - Border Erosion]( https://www.forums.red/p/theredpill/70614/the_viability_of_the_red_pill_in_the_future_border_erosion):

> Every day, our mod team removes at least two or three such fellows who arrive with well meaning but misdirected attempts to tone down the misogyny here so that we can still discuss the good parts of TRP without all that hatred! ""TRP is really just about self improvement, afterall,"" they would say.


>And it certainly sounds nice to think that. Yeah, we are here to get better, aren't we?


> But serving the feminine imperative is exactly what that does. What is the word ""improvement"" without a goal to work towards? If we are making ourselves better, then to whose standard of better are we striving? If we accept the notion of dropping misogyny (or the apparent misogyny, *as it were*) and focusing only on politically correct advice such as working out and eating right, then we have done a great service to the feminine imperative. We have curtailed our own goals to serve the feminine. We have changed ourselves to benefit others. That sort of self-improvement is acceptable to our politically correct overlords. It seems so easy to adopt it and move on, that almost every single male organization did so without realizing the consequences, and are now shells of their former selves.

Being able to be unabashedly male and use whatever language to discuss whatever ideas we deem appropriate is not only beneficial to a male community- it is a requirement. It is the heart and spirit of TRP… And today, it is under attack like never before.

As of now, we have lost half a dozen or more mods, and hundreds of subscribers to Reddit’s anti-evil operations. As of this morning, /u/Whisper has finally gotten the ax. (Reach out to him on his verified trp.red account). We are no longer in editorial control of this subreddit. We do not control the message, we are not allowed to provide you the freedom to control your own message, we do not have any room to play. This subreddit is completely compromised by the admin who have been clamoring to destroy us since the beginning. Not with better, more persuasive ideas, but instead by attempting to corrupt and destroy us.

But the joke is on them. They cannot destroy these ideas. They can’t change TRP. They cannot stop the train that’s already left the station. The Red Pill is in the wild. Billionaires have used the phrase. [We’re on television](https://i.redd.it/yuekqqa34in11.jpg). We’re in your politician’s speeches. An entire generation now uses the phrase “red pilling” to indicate **WAKING UP**.

And we have https://trp.red and https://forums.red/i/theredpill to continue the conversation without being hindered by the authoritarians and bloopies who wish to see our ideas fail. It never once occurred to them that all they had to do was come up with a better idea and ours would simply fail. 

We’re not alone with this encroaching censorship. FDS finally jumped ship (and even if I think they’re morons, they deserve to be able to speak). Incels were banned. MGTOW canned. Where All the Good Men Are got temporarily banned, but they know what’s coming for them. In fact, they’re so convinced that they’ve moved their (hilarious and fun) operations to https://www.forums.red/i/whereareallthegoodmen and  https://www.forums.red/i/whereallthegoodmenare. 

Our time is nearing an end on reddit. This message is for those who come here after we are no longer able to get the message out. Reddit is dead. We will no longer be able to maintain a proper conversation here. As a means of keeping the door open we will not be locking the forums as of yet, but we keep them open with the following warning:

1,CorporateLand: Don’t Kill the Job v. Quiet Quitting.,258,xf7fwr,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/xf7fwr/corporateland_dont_kill_the_job_v_quiet_quitting/,47,"**CorporateLand: Don’t Kill the Job v. Quiet Quitting.**


So two different convos with two of my young protégés has led me to this and probably another CorporateLand post: Just when you think you are out of CorporateLand, they drag you back in.  

Today’s Lesson: Don’t Kill the Job.

What does that mean?  So your old, wise Uncle Vaz, in the dark old days when your parents were young – your parents used to be young, btw.  And they used to *have sex*.   With Each Other.  I know */shudder*, you think they only had sex once per kid, but really they fucked like bunnies.  Your mom used to be totally down.  Anyway, it is how it is – was in a labor union.  

If you have ever been in a union, you have undoubtedly heard the phrase, *“Don’t kill the job.”*  You will have heard this if you worked on a quota system – I actually did not, but I know guys who did (UAW).  So what does it mean?  It means, if your quota is 17 cars and you can build 26, do you build 26?  Fuck no.  Why?

Don’t kill the job.

If you blow it out to 26, your quota will rise to 26 and you will miss out on milking the job on the way up, and therefore you will miss out on all that sweet, sweet profit-sharing.  Is it a scam?  Sure.  Just like lawyers who pad their hours, and department heads who have to “spend their budgets”.  Everyone knows about it, and everyone does it.

In CorporateLand, you know what happens when you’re an “exempt” employee?  You don’t get paid for overtime or doing extra work.  You also don’t get paid for doing less work.  Which one would you rather be?  

*“But Uncle Vaz,”* you say, *“What about having a strong work ethic?  What about ‘citizenship’ behaviors, like coming in early and working late?”*  All that’s great, particularly when you’re a scrub and you’re just starting out.  Also if you work in a small business and you need to get noticed by the owner.  But we’re talking CorporateLand here.  Dafuq are you working late for?  Can’t get your shit done during work hours?  Also, for some unknown reason, among Boomers coming in early “counts more”.  Not sure why.  Never cared.  

All ‘citizenship’ behaviors get you these days is ‘citizenship’ fatigue. Once upon a time, I watched a guy in a parallel department whose boss was retiring bust his ass for a promotion.  In fairness, the guy was a hard worker anyway.  He ‘invested’ in his work with the idea he’d slide into that spot, and, in years past, he would have.  

Except.  You guys can see the falling anvil, right?

Except the company had been bought by private equity firm that is all about extracting every last nickel.  So he didn’t get the promotion.  Nobody did. The position was eliminated.  You know what he got?  He got his old boss’ *WORK.*  You know what else he didn’t get?  Any extra pay.  

Now, there are certain benefits to being prosocial.  I’m a believer in it, in terms of building relationships and making my life easy.  As I say, *“Make sure you have a positive balance in the ‘Favor Bank’.”*  But don’t let yourself get taken advantage of.  Right after the next bonus cycle, that dud was *gone*.  

I left myself some time thereafter.  About 3-4 years later I was back in the building working for a couple of weeks at a location my new company had there, training up some young MFers – kind of like what I do you guys only with much more of a filter – and I bumped into some of my former co-workers.  I asked about a few people and they had all left – these were folks who you would *want* to have kept.  So basically things got worse, and the people with options left.  That operation is still going on, but it’s not the place it used to be.  I suppose that’s fine with ownership, so long as they can load it up with debt, pay themselves fees, B/K the place and move on to the next acquisition.

**Quiet Quitting.**

I don’t know who thinks this is some sort of recent development, but about half the country is “Quiet Quitting” at any given time.  Just doing the bare minimum not to get fired.  Just think of retail alone.  The overwhelming majority of people don’t have careers, they have jobs.  Some folks are in and out of the labor market on purpose.  I knew a guy who would work, take double shifts, save his $ and then quit and go surfing or skiing for 3 months.  I knew a couple that were both attys.  They would do doc reviews for 6 months and then take 6 months off.  People use the labor market differently.  

My way of thinking is: *""The purpose of my 9 to 5 is to give me the 5 to 9 I want – popping bottles and shagging models.""* I say that (mostly) in jest, but the reality is that whatever your work is, unless you are one of those rare people who gets to work in something they love – Chris Martin and Mick Jagger, I am looking at you - then the purpose of your work is to provide you and your family and loved ones with comfort and care.

As always, gents, stay lean, stay hungry, and keep stacking paper and building your world.",1663274677.0
2,Schrödinger’s Girlfriend,245,xeo5r0,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/xeo5r0/schrödingers_girlfriend/,85,"**Schrödinger’s Girlfriend**

*“Girls are never single, girls are never in relationships.”*

-From, “The Sayings of Chairman Zaitzev”

Girls fuck like we eat sandwiches.  That option is always available to them.  BBQ chicken with cheddar and bacon?  Nah, a Reuben today.  Oh, wait, I changed my mind.  I’ll have a BLT.  It’s that easy for them.  They walk around with a box between their legs that grants wishes.  

As I have written before, to you, it’s a precious commodity; to them it’s a universally accepted form of payment.  A woman with a sex drive like a man can sate that, at will, every night of the week.  She can hold out on you, because, for her, sex is *always* on the table.

Yeah, I know.  It’s a bit depressing.  If we were women we’d buy vibrators and never leave the house.  I would fuckin 100% do that.  But I’m glad I’m a dude, and a High Gas dude at that.  Why?  Because we literally can do everything else.  And that has value.  So once you pull your head out of your ass and make something of yourself, women will be *lining up* to give you pussy.  

So that brings us to Schrödinger’s Girlfriend.

**Girls Are Never Single**

There is always (or nearly always) a guy they are (a) fucking, (b) they want to fuck, and/or (c) they are currently withholding sex from, but are fucking.  And that can change at any moment. 
You might bang them on Thursday and think things are great, only to have them ghost you.  You pore over your text messages to see where you went wrong.

Don’t.  It’s not about you.  Her ex pinged her and wanted a second chance. Or you were a revenge fuck to make things “even” with her cheating boyfriend.  Or the Chad she was chasing had and opening.  Don’t torture yourself.  Be happy you hit and move on.

**Girls Are Never in Relationships**

For the right guy, girls are always single.  You know you have them when they aren’t playing games because they can’t *afford* to play games and risk you walking away.  This is a version of the *‘Fuck YEAH!’* girl.  Hypergamy is a cruel master.  If you’re a reach for her, she can’t miss out.

Which guy do you want to be?

3,Gameplan for newbies by a newbie :),24,xe37v8,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/xe37v8/gameplan_for_newbies_by_a_newbie/,68,"Hola amigos!! This is my current gameplan.  Please note that I am a newbie and a few days ago I completed seddit's 100sets challenge. During the challenge I was doing daygame only and was using direct game (stating your interest right at the beginning). 

I learnt a lot about what game is and how to go about practising this beautiful art in a consistent manner. While doing direct game I observed that, whenever I reduced the time in between the sets I entered flow state which made my next interaction go very well..I was also able to get a few closes (5- IG close and 1- number close, although they didn't go anywhere). 

The problem or challenges with direct game that I found: 

As I was and am doing only daygame in the malls. I had a REALLY HARD TIME coming across a single girl, most of the women were in the groups and I had no idea how to approach groups. But out of naivety I once made a direct approach to a group of 3 women. It freaked them out and they gave me really dirty looks, which fucked my mental state that day. That's when I decided to change my strategy to indirect game.

I have used this gameplan to CONSISTENTLY open groups and single women in a daygame setting with great success (At my current skill level I am getting good reactions). After doing the initial 3-4 sets I am in flow state which makes me come across as outcome independent and confident. People pick on this energy and are drawn to me because of this.


Now the actual nuts and bolt of my gameplan:-

Opener:- 'Love vs Being in Love with someone' opener. (Took this from rules of game)

Me: Hey i have only got a second before I leave, but i want your guy's opinion on something. (False time constraint- very critical always use this before opening a set)

Group/Girl: Sure.

Me: What is the difference between love and being in love with someone? The reason I am asking u is this because I just received a text from a friend of mine, her bf broke up with her. He told her, ""he loves her but he is not in love with her."" What's very strange is that my friend heard this exact speech given by her friend  the other day to someone. Since then she and I have been figuring out what it means? 

Group/Girl: blah blah.

Me: I guess that makes sense. Because if i go to my best friend, hug him out and say, ""I love you."" It would be okay. But if go and say to him, ""I am in love with you."" He will probably punch me and freak out.

From here u can tease her about her shoes/goggles etc. (This is called as disqualification)

Then transition to cold reading/ring finger routine-  google this u will find the required info :).

Try initiating physical touch in your interaction (CALIBRATE and then go for it)..

In every interaction try to push your limits..that is take calculated risks which will help u develope social intelligence.

Once u get 3 IOIs qualify her/ connect with her and finally go for close or go for Insta date if u feel like the interaction is going well. ( Go for close irrespective of how the interaction is going..just for practice)

Some foot notes & observations:-

1: I will probably get downvoted for this...but initially i was very skeptical about this material wheter it would work or not..But once I started internalizing this particular material...My delivery, body language, along eye contact and all the non verbals improved..which caused the interactions to go really well. 

2: Having a memorized line helped me get over the fear of approaching. Because I know exactly what to say. This helped me to come across as more confident and make a great impression. Also, as a newbie I am opening 7 sets daily which adds to 49 sets a week..If u keep this up for one year..you will have approached 49 sets ×53 weeks = 2597 sets in a year (Imagine the experience and the powerful set of social skills u will have after a year.) 

3: Even If i have a success ratio of 0.4 % in 2597 sets.. that translates to 11/10  in a year. (Not bad for a newbie)

4: Memorizing may seem conniving or unnatural initally but this is how the old school guys did it. The so called gurus u see today have got good by following a structure. Once they got good and developed calibration and social intuition they started doing advanced stuff..Use these as training wheels for your first 1000 approaches. Don't reinvent the wheel.

5: First set of the day is always the hardest, get it done as soon as u enter the venue. Follow 3 seconds rule. After sometime u will start feeling good..So do the sets irrespective of how u are feeling..(Use your common sense.. don't take this statement to the extreme and at face value, just because I said so.. Don't approach if u had an accident/friend died or some other traumatic life event.. REMEMBER TO USE COMMON SENSE)

6: I want to try night game but getting into clubs daily and paying for cover charges is a huge cost for me due to my current financials. I am currently solving that area along with this area.. Hopefully in six months I will be able to afford to go clubs daily and practice my night game.

6: I haven't still got a close from this approach any feedback on how to solve this would be appreciated.

7: Finally a quote from Bruce Lee to end this, ""Absorb what is useful. Discard what is not. Add what is uniquely your own.""

Hope this helps. Do try this and let me know how it went. :)

4,Why some post wall women get married and have staying power,45,xdjhsw,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/xdjhsw/why_some_post_wall_women_get_married_and_have/,37,"I’ll cut right to these chase: generics and low n count. 

Now what post wall women am discussing? The party girl who rode the cock carousel and now wants to settle down? The chronically abused woman who can’t help but date men who beat her? No no, I’m talking about the women with the least incidents of falling into the hypergamous nature. Now these women are the ones who generally don’t fear being lead by their men, are far less combative than your average woman, typically their n count is lower single digits (1 to at the most 3) with no incident of casual sex of ex-hookups, I attribute this to upbringing more than the nature of women. Now how does these older women end up finding commitment despite their old age? 

Genetics: a woman in her 30s that doesn’t look 30 can easily find commitment, her outward appearance projects fertility and youth and I suspect that these women do stay fertile for longer than the average woman in her early to late 30s. It helps to squash the feminist argument that men prefer old women, numerically these women are old by physically and biologically they are still young and fresh in a manner of speaking. But, it is not just genetics at play here; women who take care of their bodies and skin will look younger and be more fertile and youthful than their peers. I have witnessed a older woman do complete 180 after she took charge if her health and appearance, looked busted but several months later was looking very fresh. No work done as she is too poor to afford this and doesn’t partake in the sugar dating arrangement (stereotypical church mouse type without the slutty history). 

The only older women getting wifed up or LTR’d are those that are still youthful, have maintained peak fertility and have an agreeable nature and a body count of zero or 3 through their entire lives. This is speculation and I am purposely excluding the betabux relationships here as I don’t consider them valid, I’m speaking of real men who pick these women as help-mates.",1663105203.0

To just go with the flow, because obviously hes caught this bitches attention enough to get her horny for him.

So I ask him if hes got rubbers, ""No, I dont, but she does?"". Told ese to go and buy some, hers may not fit him right, and last thing we need our accidents at our age. So this bitch ahead of us in the lunch line chimes in, and ar first, I wont lie she gave a solid bit of advice, that he should visit a health center and get them for free. I forgot those things exist. I still tell him to buy some.

6,Anger Precedes Desire,77,xarwiq,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/xarwiq/anger_precedes_desire/,27,"# What is Anger?

Anger is a physiologically excited state which signals that you perceive that something is wrong and should be made right. Anger need not necessarily manifest as physical violence/harm. Call this being **assertive**. Assertion is the utility of masculinity.

The normative claim is the zero level of your desire and will. If you want something, you are implicitly making a normative claim that something is wrong (not having, doing, or being that thing) and should be made right. Do not suppress this fundamental perception due to postmodernism or whatever. The other option is roll over and spread your cheeks.

The purpose of this post is to encourage you to introspect and unravel the knot you may have around anger and aggression so that you will stop languishing. For example, my father was a dumb cunt and expressed his anger towards his children like a emotional retard - yes, that is the scientific term. This unsophisticated interpretation of anger stayed with me until I unraveled the logic and assumptions with which my subconscious operated.

# Final note

You probably have a ton of unsophisticated interpretations of many aspects of reality that you formulated when you were an illiterate child. I know I did and do. I highly encourage you take the time to introspect and fix your bullshit. Your inner world determines your outer world. Also just because you make a normative claim does not mean it is respectable.",1662823122.0
7,Crawl Out Of The Metaphorical Vagina (You're Not Special) [Guest Post],164,xa5a1a,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/xa5a1a/crawl_out_of_the_metaphorical_vagina_youre_not/,31,"**Intro**

If you're a respected member of any community like this one, you end up getting a lot of DMs. About 90% of them follow this process and need the title answer:

> plz bro i need advice can i ask you a question IMMEDIATELY I NEED HELP NOW

> i'm trying to figure out what to do in my life, i've tried nothing and i'm all out of ideas

> i am a [some age] loser with no friends and no career direction

> how do i fukkk girls????

BTW - don't ask if you can ask a question. Tremendously annoying. Anyway...

------

**Diagnosis**

With said 90%, every time they:

1. don't lift hard, 
2. haven't socialized whatsoever,  
3. think a woman will somehow make them not an uninteresting, unlikeable BITCH

What I have to tell them is simple, but the fix isn't going to be easy. I tell them, 

>""You are parasite #125781025 in my DM who thinks they need a Mystical Red Pill Wizard to tell them the magic spell incantation. Even if I gave you legit advice, you'd use that to feelz good and continue your plan of inaction."" 

Seeking my advice when you're this far behind is fucking stupid for 3 reasons:

1. There is nothing I can tell you that you could not figure out yourself, because you're failing the basics by not trying

2. Outsourcing your decision making to me, and therefore your agency and masculinity, will never work

3. A woman cannot fix this problem, even if you miraculously manage to attract one in this pathetic condition - you'll be back 3mos later with a sob story about how she ""was BPD bro""

--------

**The Problem**

Boys spend nine full months trying to exit their mother's vagina. In the age of the internet, for some reason many are trying their hardest to crawl back in. 

*Why can't you make friends?* 

Because your interests are computer bullshit and you're therefore not INTEREST-ing. 

*Why can't you stick to a plan that betters your money, your physical shape, your status?* 

Because you are a lazy fuck who decided mommy's food is enough to wake up every day.

*Why can't you get girls?* 

Shit, have you even tried to fuck one recently?

You can’t get any pussy, much less any friends, if you’re nestled nice and cozy in mommy’s womb. 

**The Solution**

Want a change? Don't fucking bother some guy like me, DO THE BASICS. 

If you read TRP stuff daily, you have mental issues. Another book isn't going to get you out of the vagina, updating your resume and hitting the gym 4x/wk will. 

**And don't think friends will solve the problem.** You'll just be crawling into their asshole hoping the Magical Friend Fairies somehow ""motivate"" you instead of doing the work. Last time I checked, notably, you need consent to get in there. 

You need a MISSION. You need GOALS that support that mission. When you have those, you can wake up in the morning and have a purpose instead of living a life of distraction.

It was always tacitly accepted that women had the upper hand in all sexual negotiations, because of the much higher male sex drive. But, it all got out of kilter during the sexual revolution of the 1960s. Flush with the liberating novelty of the birth control pill, women were dispensing their main asset too easily. The price of pussy plummeted, smash and dash became the norm. Single parenthood went through the roof, female (and government) panic ensued, third wave feminism took off, putting pressure on politicians, who are only too keen to pander to the majority of the electorate. The plan was simple. *'We must make it easier for women to earn their own money. We need to try to reverse this current promiscuity by making it more difficult and dangerous for men to interact with women, and we'll fleece men's assets if they become fathers.'* Now, we have male earning power eroded through EEO/AA, while female sexual power has been artificially bolstered through laws which demonise men, and could criminalise them for daring to *look* at a woman in the street, far less approach her for a chat, to assess compatibility. Financially depleted men walk a minefield of women whose value has been artificially inflated by anti-male legislation. We are all paying the price for choices made by women more than half a century ago, when (courtesy of science) they finally gained control of their own fertility, and used it to try to make fathers out of Chad Thundercock.",1662466134.0
9,I am a Blue pill beta cuck. I now fully understand.,122,x723ak,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x723ak/i_am_a_blue_pill_beta_cuck_i_now_fully_understand/,55,"I'll get straight to the point.

3 years ago I discovered TRP, the formula was alien to me, it was something I had rarely seen anywhere except for what the older men I knew in family had vaguely told me in forms of advice. But I had always accepted what they said as ""bitter oldman gibberish"". Then after a week of reading the side bar and most of the top posts, books, subjects about female behavior, frame and overall masculinity; I began to see that the TRP was happening all around me, under the fabric of my everyday life. 
It was right under my nose and I had missed it. 
I was 22 5'9""/175cm 123lb/57kg at the time, typical white knight, typical emotional tampon, typical third wheel, got bullied through school, smoked cigarettes as a crutch, smoked weed to ""open my mind"" ironically. 

And yet at that time, I saw myself as a hero from some fantasy book.
But in reality, I was just a big head on a really skinny and weak body with a weaker and skinnier brain inside my head; driven by dopamine.

I got constantly laughed at by friends and strangers, getting called pretty boy, addict, which i took for jokes, I was always the one pleasing everybody, thinking it being ""good"".

And so after reading and seeing the truth, I began to take action, I started with running, could not breathe the first few session cause of all the cigs. but i pushed through.

then after a while started doing push ups and pull ups. All the real feel good hormones started to replace the old ones in my brain.
I went like this for 2 months straight, I didn't gain much weight but i could see that my figure had changed. I could see and distinguish every muscle. (I had isolated myself for all that time)

Now after the noticeable changes I started to see how others react differently to me, showing more respect. Having to speak less because my struggle spoke for itself.

Now i was hungry for more so i hit the local gym and began to lift the real shit.
and by the time i was 23. I was noticeably athletic. 

This was when I began to apply frame,
and this is when I found a 9.

I began to mess around with this girl and we were fucking like rabbits.

AND THEN, It all went downhill from there.
I thought i had finished the TRP marathon.
I thought of it as one big dopamine hit.

So I started smoking again, skipping important shit just to fuck this girl.
Skipping the gym, pulling off pointless all nighters.
and eventually, I was right back where i started.

A dopamine addict.

But If i owe myself anything is to get it all back.

EDIT 2:
For those who are wondering:

During the peak of my training, I was 23-24 60kg with very little fat percentage, I remember getting asked by trainers about my diet and exercise plan, getting recommendation on what to do, and being spotting buddies.

Outside the gym I was mentally euphoric, very sure about myself and what I wanted to do next and what my ultimate goal was. I would rarely talk mostly kept my mouth shut because i appeared trustworthy, others did the talking and i contributed very little unless asked to.

The same people that bullied me and made fun of me now admired my hard work when i occasionally ran into them. Most of which were genetic alpha types (born tall/big/muscular). I made friends with some of the bullies who where assholes with goals and made the rest invisible in my mind.

I live in a tough city, the criminal mindset is the bible here. ( being a crook is seen as being somewhat kingly)
Although I rarely got myself involved in their business. I was welcomed as an outsider/guest among them.

One thing I can tell you for sure is at this day and age where everybody is either high,drunk or just plain fucked up on something; And you're just sitting sober among them. The Alpha types see you as their own.",1662442046.0

Women have invaded previously male employment opportunities, didn't like what they encountered, and were determined to change these to their advantage, as soon as female critical mass was reached. Nature made it easy for them. Women stick together, no matter how illogical their 'concerns', and men compete with other men, not with women. With a female workplace adversary, men will inevitably defer, it's never a good look to keep illustrating the flaws in their argument, too easy to be labelled as a bully, or worse. As a result, men must now tiptoe through a feminised workplace. With the decline of heavy industry, there are few male workplaces left intact, apart from the dirty and dangerous ones. Every year, more of the clean, high-paying jobs are filled by women. Yet, men retain all of the disadvantages of courtship.... having to make all of the approaches (in an increasingly hostile social environment), picking up the tab for the outrageous expense involved, and with the constant threat of rejection. As a result, modern women have gained financial parity while retaining sexual advantage. They can have their cake and eat it....

11,FR: This shit works for real,336,x6amnp,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x6amnp/fr_this_shit_works_for_real/,205,"M35, Married 1 year.

My wife, who is generally submissive and follow orders like a good teammate, since just recently has been throwing tantrums and nagging. Probably due to comfort setting in. She's the type of woman who works out, doesn't drink/smoke, takes good care of my home, is generally very sorted in a life. Whenever we go out men are always checking her out and she knows it.

One day we were having dinner with my dad, and he simply pointed out a mistake she had made in preparing gifts for her parents. My wife lost her cool, took it on her ego probably, and behaved in a rude way with my dad. That was totally uncalled for, my dad was generally being ""the big man"" trying to point out a mistake in a humble way. No where did he step out of line. But her reaction was totally out of line. I did not like it. I cannot stand for toxic behaviour in my house especially when it is uncalled for. And my dad means a lot to me to, he's been a good father and taught me invaluable life skills.

Immediately when my wife spoke (shouted), I corrected her, and told her ""that is not how you speak."" Never have I felt the need to correct her in the presence of others, this was the first time. 

For the following two days, my wife is visibly pissed, not talking to me. I can sense that she feels guilt for the way she acted. She slept in the other room the first night. I didn't GAF. I proceeded with my routine: wake up at 6, work out, head to work, come home, go for a run, eat dinner, work, read and sleep. The following night when I call it a night and switch off the lights, my wife gets close and holds me tight, trying to initiate. I was sleepy as hell, had a big day the next day, I didn't react and I fell asleep. The next morning I proceed with my routine.

She works in my company (work from home) and takes care of the home, cleaning and cooking. She texts me ""I spoke to xxx company I worked for previously about a job. They are willing to take me back and I'm taking it."" I don't reply. I knew she's just trying to get a reaction from me. I sense it is an empty threat. (fast forward, that's exactly what it was) 

When I return home, she says she wants to talk. I say ""about what?"", she says ""about that dinner with dad.""  I told her ""you need to cut shit out, that was clearly disrespectful. You have a choice, family comes first, or I'll bring the divorce papers and you simply have to sign it.""

She goes all mad. Says ""Ok I'm leaving for my mom's, send the papers to me, I'll sign it."" I say ""OK"". In the meantime, she's packing her things, returns her wedding ring and a diamond necklace I gave her (my dad gave to me to gift her), and leaves. I didn't react. Didn't even say a goodbye, didn't even walk her to the door.

15 minutes later she returns. She apologizes and tells me she'll never repeat it. Then she throws a shit test ""I thought you will come after me after I left to stop me from leaving, but you didn't."" I said ""I was gonna. You returned too soon.""

The proceeding night she dresses up in erotic lingerie, gives me a treat for my eyes and we have pornstar sex. The following morning I suddenly wake up at 5:30 with her mouth moistening my morning wood. We proceed to bathroom sex and shower together.

This shit really works. What shit? STFU. IDGAF. My frame not hers. Dread.

I didn't flinch to her threats, I showed her that she is discardable if she doesn't behave (divorce papers), didn't get all whiney and apologetty, didn't stop her when threatened to leave. Didn't try to ""keep her"" when she said she's quitting my company. They come around still. They always do.

It describes a ‘path’ that is only going to become more & more common among women. Women whom, have been brainwashed by society to spend their 20s chasing Chad, 'experiences', a career and ‘independence’. And only find out in their 30s (or even later) that there was a good reason women of the past tried to marry & settle down asap.

This post is not meant to shit on OP, but strictly for educational purposes. Like I said, there are many women like her and many more to come. Stuff like this should be mandatory reading for every young man.

**There's a lot of hamstering, but if you want to read the entire thing, be my guest; I have bolded & italicized the 3 nuggets**. If you read the 3 nuggets while skipping everything in between, it actually condenses the post perfectly.

>Hello RPW. I have been a lurker for several months. I am here for advice as someone who has discovered RP a bit late. I appreciate the logical, honest responses I see on this sub.  
>  
>TL;DR: I (33F) am someone who has never considered marriage or children as a must-have in life until recently. Now it’s all I can think about as it relates to my 6.5-year relationship with my boyfriend (34M) who is a wonderful, stable man who I trust wholeheartedly, respect dearly, have fun with, and love... despite his openly neutral-veering-on-negative feelings towards the institution of marriage.  
>  
>**My Background**  
>  
>I am 33F. So far in my life I haven’t been one to definitively say my life will or won’t go any certain way. I have been open to all relationships, friendships, opportunities, etc. While keeping a logical mindset in terms of making sure my life is in order to my standard (think: my needs are met, I am financially secure, I am happy, I am healthy). I don't think of myself as RP necessarily, or traditional. Feminist messaging was/is a constant in my life (think: men suck, you're independent and can do anything without a man, you are better than a man, etc.). But I like to think I'm very level-headed, rational, and a critical thinker, so I've never fully bought in to that messaging (or dismissed it) and more now than ever have been questioning it and exploring other points of view.  
>  
>Also up until now, I never thought I'd definitely get married, or definitely have kids. Or definitely hit any kind of milestone. I think part of my mindset with marriage is due to my upbringing. My parents weren’t married until I was 16 years old and even then, once they did marry, it was for insurance/tax purposes and very low-key (courthouse, steak dinner, done!) This view of marriage kind of being an afterthought and not really necessary definitely stuck with me.  
>  
>Despite that, I love relationships! Ever since college, I have loved spending my time with a partner who is my closest “person” and who I enjoy their company (until, well, I don’t). With each relationship I had been in through my adult years since I was 18, four relationships varying in length between six months – three years, I’ve learned more about myself and what I want from a partner. Which brings me to my current relationship (my fifth and longest relationship) and where I’m at now!  
>  
>**My Current Relationship**  
>  
>I’ve been with my boyfriend (34M) since I was 26 and he was 27, just about 6.5 years. When I met him I was at a place where I was being more intentional about what I wanted from a future (and hopefully final or very long term) partner. I had no label for it then, but I do believe now in looking back, that I vetted well simply in terms of who I wanted to be my boyfriend and partner (again, no label for it, more so just common sense – I had learned a lot up to that point and I could see so many qualities in him that made me feel happy safe comfortable etc). I distinctly remember at the time thinking “I want to be with someone that I can respect.” And he was and still is someone I respect and trust fully.  
>  
>Only thing was, in looking back, he was open about his negativity towards marriage from the start when we were only friends for a few months. Not in any serious conversations, but in passing conversations like “Oh I’ll never get married; it’s an outdated institution,” or explaining his past where his parents weren't married and his dad had been through a bad divorce so he believes it to be non-beneficial or even risky to a man.  
>  
>At the time, I thought nothing of it (or even thought wow that makes sense for a man) because I could have cared less about getting married. It wasn’t on my radar AT ALL. And so I entered in to a relationship with him, that not being in my mind at all. I was focusing on work and a hobby I love. I was paying off student loan debt. I was enjoying friendships and independence. All the while still benefiting from having my boyfriend by my side and enjoying my times with him. When COVID hit at at the \~4-year mark of our relationship, we were living together and I was happy to have him to spend my days with. We got a puppy during that time and I started to fall in love with the idea of a family. That was about 1.5 years ago and probably was the very first flicker of the light that sparked this whole journey of realizing I actually do see the meaning in marriage and do want that for my own life.  
>  
>However, it was a slow burn until something significant shifted in me ***a few months ago.*** ***I started really digging in to fertility research. First, feeling anger that I was so unlucky to have to be a woman and be faced with this ticking clock.*** Then, leaning in to the fact that I'm so lucky to be a woman and have this ability in me! Further embracing more of my feminine qualities which does come quite natural.  
>  
>So all of a sudden, very quickly, the following realizations have happened:  
>  
>1) I am realizing how much I want to try and have children and to be so lucky for that to be a part of my life. (have confirmed boyfriend also would like to have children, whereas he's been unsure / neutral on that topic before as well) And that I specifically want to have my boyfriend's children >>>  
>  
>2) ***Which led me to the realization that I want marriage because of the security and sensibleness of it for a woman who is having children.*** Plus the togetherness of it all and being a family and leaning in to my feminine self as a part of a marriage and sharing a name and \*\*butterflies ensue\*\* >>>  
>  
>3) Which always leads me to the realization that my boyfriend has expressed to me he doesn't want marriage. And sadness in realizing that I'm getting to this a little bit late to have options I may have had before.  
>  
>Phew, okay, so you can see how this spirals. Writing this has been cathartic. But now to put this in to a question I am asking for advice on:  
>  
>**My Question...**  
>  
>I’d love to show my boyfriend what I've discovered about marriage, and for him to feel a desire for marriage too (as well as a relationship where he embraces his masculine traits and I embrace my feminine traits). How do I do this, with all of the considerations in mind, and without being a nag?  
>  
>I don't think that an ultimatum is an option for me given my age and desire for having his children. And, frankly, I love the life I have with my boyfriend and dog so much that I'd sooner stay with him forever as a girlfriend than leave him for not wanting marriage. At the same time, ***without marriage I think I'll be so scared of him ending things suddenly at no risk to him when it comes to children (since he still has so many years left and could find a younger woman to have his children).*** And thus, based on our nature of being a man versus being a woman, I understand now why marriage exists still and why it's important. If you've made it this far, I appreciate you reading and would love to hear any thoughts or advice, positive, critical, or otherwise.

What entertains me especially is that nowhere in the post or comments someone talks about what she can offer in return for marriage. What she can offer in return for half his assets. The truth is that the only thing she can realistically offer is whatever she has not 'handed over' **yet**. In this case, birthing him children & taking care of those children. The catch is, that's in her best interest as well.

So what it comes down to is that women like this want something (very expensive) at no direct cost to them other than opportunity cost. But you will rarely if ever hear a woman talk about this, as it's not a particularly great deal for the counterparty. Which is why great marketing is a must.

Most people today in the western world (especially men it seems) don't know how to play the power game. We rather moralize and virtue signal than deploy Machiavellian tactics to achieve our own interests with as little compromise as possible. Putin's Russia (supposedly a backward country & culture) cucking the entire EU is a fine example. Imagine making fun of an economy that's a pumping station, but it turns out that your own economy and political system falls apart without one.

Anyway, as a good friend of mine likes to say about power games played in the corporate world; 'Everybody is participating, but there are few who play'.

13,Super simple “Basic Guy Game” structure that will help you begin meeting women.,158,x5p799,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x5p799/super_simple_basic_guy_game_structure_that_will/,36,"You want to meet new women but you have no idea how. You dont know how to approach, what to talk about, what to say or what to do. When you do approach your mind runs a million miles a minute because you are nervous and feeling the pressure. 

All of the above is normal and commonly happens to men who are new to meeting random women outside your social circle. 

What I have for you is something called “Basic Guy Game.” BGG works by reducing seduction down to its most raw essentials and will help you work on getting comfortable with the “building blocks” of male to female social interactions.

The structure works like this:  

See attractive woman -> say “Hi, what’s up?” -> If good reaction ask her for her name and then give yours. If bad reaction tell her to have a nice day and walk away -> Ask her something about about herself such as an item of clothing shes wearing. Talk about anything but try to keep the conversation about her as she doesn’t know you yet so she doesn’t really care about you. -> After a few minutes tell her “You seem cool. Let’s exchange numbers and see if we click more” -> If you do or dont get the number tell her to have a nice day and walk away.

That’s super simple “Basic Guy Game” that will get you comfortable approaching and talking to women. Keep in mind that it doesn’t matter if you got the number! The entire goal at this stage is to simple desensitize yourself to meeting new women and starting conversations.

Once you reach the point where you can do the above while being relatively comfortable its time to start adding in more actual seduction techniques. That’s a post for later…

Make sure you are also working on your fundamentals such as dressing well, having a nice haircut, well groomed and smelling good, working out and not being to fat or to skinny, standing up straight, confident voice, and being able to hold eye contact. The better your fundies are the better responses you will have from women.

Two twin brothers can both approach 100 women using the exact same structure as above but if Twin A has good fundamentals and Twin B has poor fundamentals, Twin A will get much better reactions and have better results. 

At this point I know a lot of guys are going to freak out about the “talking about her” part and wonder what to say. Here are some basic things you can use to get started:  

Ask her about an item of clothing shes wearing and ask her why she chose that or ask her how she arrived at her style of clothing.  You can transition into talking about personality traits.

Ask her about her race and where her family is originally from. From there you can easily transition into talking about travel. 

Ask her what shes out doing. From there you can transition into asking her about what she would rather be doing right now if she could be doing anything with no limitations.

Tell her that she reminds you of a celebrity. Then just name one and even if she looks nothing like her tell her its more of her “energy” that reminds you of said celebrity. Transition to talking about energy and personality or pop culture or tv/movies.

The conversation only has to go on for a few minutes and then go for the number if things are going well. 

You are NOT required to keep talking to women who are boring and dont interest you! Feel free to wish her well and walk away at any point. 

That’s it! Keep doing it until you can be comfortable and not overwhelmed with nerves.",1662304053.0
14,I once knew a militant feminist in college...one of my first lessons of AWALT.,330,x5if8q,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x5if8q/i_once_knew_a_militant_feminist_in_collegeone_of/,58,"Here is the tale of the militant feminist:

When I was in college, the department I was in (where most of my classes were) shared the same building as the Women's Studies department. So inevitably, we had frequent contact with one another. But there was one girl I will never forget...

Now at that time, the Women's Studies (WS) department had a ""club"" where they would collaborate and go to events/talks about the ""patriarchy"" and all that. Their leader was your stereotypical militant feminist type. She had dreads, wore wool beanies, had black rimmed glasses, wore baggy shirts, lip rings, etc. I used to see her around the building but never talked to her. But I could tell there was an intensity about her just from her overall vibe.

So, I had a group of friends that would get together and go out for coffee or drinks a couple times a week or so. Most were working on the same major as I was and there were some WS people sprinkled in. One day, we were having coffee and one of the WS girls brought the ""club leader"" chick along. And holy shit, she was something else. First, when she spoke, she would kind of do a low pitched kind of gruff voice. She had a very tightly wound demeanor and had a very passive aggressive way of speaking (especially to the males in the group). One moment she would be cool and laugh but then her arrogance would take over and she would ""correct"" people. But I will admit that she was highly intelligent and a very quick thinker.

At some point she began talking feminism and was talking about the patriarchy and she despises how women still objectify themselves sexually and all that stuff. She was even saying how she refused to go to clubs because its a disgusting meat market for men and the women get dolled up for men to see them as nothing but ""tits and holes"". Even regular bars were something that she did not like for the same reasons but she made the occasional exception if the vibe was calm and she was with friends.

One thing I did notice though was that she always wore very tight pants (leggings/jeans). She was actually fairly attractive and she did have an ass. But the previous time we hung out, she always said she hated that men should want women for their minds and less so their bodies. She even made a point that she refuses to wear makeup and dresses for that very reason. But she apparently knew she had an ass and consciously wore the tightest pants possible every single day. This was kind of the thing that made me go hmm...

Well, one night we went to the college bar across the street from campus and she came along as well. We were drinking and she started talking again with her low pitched but still loud voice and she even got kind of confrontational with my friend because of stupid ego trips on her part. She had this intense ""I am in charge"" thing going.

So a couple hours later, a group of dudes walk in. They were probably in their 30's. But one of the dudes up front looked like a joke. He was this super skinny white dude that had the Eminem wannabe vibe going. He wore a huge shirt, baggy pants, a big chain necklace, a baseball cap that was on sideways. He even did that slow chicken walk and his eyes were half open and red from weed. My buddy and I saw him and we called him Slim Shady. So Slim Shady at one point walks up to our table and when he talked it was even funnier. He tried so hard to be some thug but it was bad. He seemed like a legit parody, it was hilarious. Anyway, he sees the feminist chick and kind of stares her down and sits next to her (there was an empty seat).

He starts talking to her and I thought, oh shit, this dude is going to have his ass handed to him. So the place is loud and I was sitting at the other end of the table so I really couldn't hear everything. But from the parts I could hear, he was hitting on her and at first she was using her intellect to make him feel stupid and throw power moves. Long story short, Slim Shady was consistent and I started to see that her demeanor changed. She would start giggling, she would do quick touches, and even her voice got way girlier/high pitched. Even her mannerisms and demeanor got more ""dainty"". Well, at one point she got up and went outside to have a cigarette and he followed. They never came back in.

Well, her friend (who was with us) was contacted by her later and told her that she was at the dude's apartment and told her that he was so amazing and the sex was rough. Even going as far as saying, she had to stop at 7 eleven on her way home because she sweat so much that she needed to replace her electrolytes which was funny as hell.

I then see her at school the next week and I walk by her and I look at her to say hi and she just ignored me (like she always did) and had her typical intense look on her face. Later, I saw her speaking in a class and she was back to the ""patriarchy"" and ""women are not sex dolls"" talks again with the low but loud voice. It was something else.  Homeboy had impeccable game and gave me one of my first examples of AWALT.",1662282383.0
15,How a loser gets laid more than some of you,177,x566zd,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x566zd/how_a_loser_gets_laid_more_than_some_of_you/,64,"In light of the influx of posts reeking of insecurity and asking why they can't get laid-- I've decided to detail one of the biggest losers I've worked with.

I used to work at a club and had the honor of working with one of the funniest-walking example of a guy that was a loser by all accounts.

To illustrate this even further- here's an example of the guest of honor:

This guy is a person of color. 
Balding with a receding hairline.
On the spectrum.
Broke all the time, but splurges on only the finest of weed.
Would go out drinking with 10 bucks to his name.
Has 3 kids with 3 different baby mamas.
Drives a shitbox.
Is an objective 6 tops. 

So you have this colorful array of a walking mess getting laid like a warlord. What separates him from some of you is that he *simply does not give a fuck*. Or at least the appearance of it.

He will go up to girls and spout the dumbest, most inane shit possible-- but he will still approach nonetheless. Eventually this guy has amassed some semblance of ""social proof"" by being seen talking and hitting on these poor unsuspecting girls.

Of the girls that have *any* interest, he will escalate and ask if they want to go and smoke with him. Usually at his place. The kicker? He doesn't even have his own place. He lives with his aunt and pays very little for rent. All the while displaying all types of nice guy behavior such as spending what little he has on his extended family.

This fine specimen of a human being is at his prime age (30s) and is still working at a club while being borderline broke. Despite all this, he will still unashamedly try to get laid with girls at the very same club that he works at.

There are many like him in even *worst* circumstances that are still able to get laid. Hell, there are accounts of homeless guys on this subreddit getting laid. I guarantee all of these guys share the same attitude-- they simply do not give a fuck and approach. That's it.

So before you go on your own little soapbox here and start crying about why you can't get laid, despite not even doing the bare minimum (lifting and reading the sidebar!), just recall our prime example right here.

He may not have the best life trajectory-- but he sure as hell has some of you guys beat on body count, albeit certainly not in the best of circumstances.

Some takeaways:

Whatever label you think is holding you back from getting laid, just remember our guest of honor.

Edit: I should also mention that women are *not* a means to an end. For some of you, it's what holds you back from achieving more (or at least foreseen by some of you). Nonetheless, they do help with achieving power if that is your goal.

They unfairly and incorrectly try to place the blame on themselves, maybe I wasn’t emotionally available to her, maybe I wasn’t man enough for her, maybe I was too much man for her. I am here to remind you that this woman was never yours, this goes beyond “she was never yours, it’s just your turn.” A woman that is so easily swayed by another man while with you, you should never take offense or feel slighted by her leaving you. If she’s had partners before you, you shouldn’t concern yourself with reacting at all when this happens. Such a woman will never truly belong to anyone apart from the streets, in a figurative or literal sense this day and age, so we as men must stop crying and and destroying our mental health and physical well being over pussy that doesn’t belong to us and never will.",1662058039.0
17,Virgin Simping: They’re still women,18,x3iwk5,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x3iwk5/virgin_simping_theyre_still_women/,49,"This is not a call out of the fellow man nor a shaming of the fellow man, it is merely to help guide those new to the community. 

Yes, a virgin is preferable for the man who wants to commit and perhaps wife her up and have kids. Virgins pair bond way easier than women with a high body count and we don’t need to go over that fact a million times. Virgins however are a rarity in the western world and the pretty non-westernized ones get married off real quick or they turn into full on whores or they just end up hareming with some other women. Now, if you have to resort to some pre-owned pussy, if that’s your preference fine but don’t force it on your fellow man, find the lowest mileage pussy possible and remember to vet vet vet. Finding a female that’s only had one or at a minimum two sexual partners years apart, either she has self control (rare in modern women), or something is wrong with her mentally or physically. These women also, for lack of a better vocabulary, don’t necessarily have to be *trained* and they fall in like quite agreeably with their man (witnessed with my brother’s second wife and she was 29 when they married).

>What You’re Forgetting

That virgin that you have firmly done your damndest to imprint on, mould into the perfect help-mate, is still a woman. She still thinks like a woman and will still act like a woman. How many men have learned that their high school sweetheart who was blushing and shy on their wedding night, has been getting railed by your brother/best friend/cousin/uncle/father/boss/co-worker/commanding officer (that’s how my brother’s first marriage is ended), because SHE feels like the marriage bed is stale or that she’s missed out on what her perpetually single girlfriends get up to. Modern women especially are very fickle with their emotions and how they *love* and their wants. 


>Never Forget 

Virgins are the best for the man seeking a LTR or perhaps marriage if you like to live dangerously. But, always keep in mind that they’re still women, invest in the virgin but don’t get too invested. She could branch at anytime and this protects the blow from being as devastating as it is for men who haven’t found TRP.",1662067114.0
18,Driving in the Fastlane,296,x2e6ot,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x2e6ot/driving_in_the_fastlane/,33,"Recently I read the book [The Millionaire Fastlane](https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Fastlane-Crack-Wealth-Lifetime/dp/0984358102) ([summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anJFf9pN16g))

It was pretty decent, the overarching idea of the book was about how you're probably ""driving"" in the safe, slow lane by having a decent job, putting money into your 401k, saving up to buy a house, maybe putting some of that money into index funds. And that in order to realistically become a millionaire, you should quit your job and go all in on starting a business. Ideally while you're still young.

This post is not about the book. In fact, this post is not even about money specifically. It's about this idea of switching into the Fastlane to reach your goals faster and more reliably that I'd like to talk about.

This is a specific issue that many guys don't experience, so if you're one of the lucky ones, this post probably won't resonate as much with you.

# We're all stunted..

If you look at the average person (man or woman), you'll notice that they're really fucking lazy. They only wanna do what they absolutely have to: Go to school/work to make a very mediocre performance   
and then go home as soon as possible to reward themselves for working so hard by playing videogames or scrolling through TikTok. If you're a fellow Gen-Zer that has had internet access during his teen years and got his first phone at 14 (or earlier) you probably suffer from this even more thanks to having your brain fried and re-wired to constantly seek out cheap dopamine from your favorite YouTuber, pornstar or motivational speaker (yes, self-improvement content can be just mental masturbation).

Humans (much like everything in nature) evolved to stick to things that work. You spend 12 hours a day playing videogames while your mom takes care of you and feeds you tendies? Hey, all your subconscious sees is that you're getting well fed and you're even spreading your genes (albeit into the anime bodypillow on your bed)! Better not change this routine that's working for us, what if you fuck it up and we'll die.

# ..stuck in the slow lane..

There's guys that swear they've been hitting the gym 4x a week for the past 3 years and their build looks like they were just rescued from Auschwitz. A big and strong body requires three main ingredients - proper exercise, sleeping and nutrition. All of these three have to be dialed in so you're gaining mass optimally. Guys decide to hit the gym for the first time in their life and so they drag their ass there, do 5 different bicep exercises, eat like shit and then get drunk in the evening. Rinse and repeat. Maybe over time they pick up a proper exercise program, but more often than not, they don't want to track macros, they don't want to sleep optimally because they ""don't have the time"" to commit.

People have a tendency to excuse this kind of behavior because ""at least it's a start"". Yeah it's a start. On the slow lane. You're getting to where you want to be very very slowly, and more importantly, your chances of actually getting there are lower. Anything can happen between now and your destination, so why not make the journey as short as possible so there's less of a time window for random devastating fuckups that could hinder the whole mission?

We're subconsciously afraid of changing things up and commiting to a completely different life routine. Which is also why when newbies stumble upon redpill ideas, they pussyfoot around implementing these ideas, hitting the gym, and doing all the things you have to do. Instead they start asking stupid questions like

* ""Can I get girls if I'm a 5'5"" Indian dude?"" 
* ""Should I even attempt to talk to girls when my jaw is this weak?""
* ""If I work out enough, I won't have to approach girls, they'll just come, right?"" (especially popular take between autistic dudes)

They do this this just to prepare themselves enough. To not hurt themselves too much when they *actually* do go out and try to talk to some girls. And they swear they will, just gotta read through the sidebar one more time bro.

# ..while winners drive past us..

I was a lot like this. My half-assed attempts at improving my life have yielded some results, but it's only after I somehow ended up at a get-together with a handful of very interesting young men. They were three Cambridge University compsci graduates that were also working at Google. Other than having 0.01 percentile IQ, there was one other interesting trait they had.

They asked me to help them with a certain non-profit so I got a chance to work with them. They were **absolutely** in the fast lane. They wasted exactly 0 seconds on useless shit. They were locked in, all in on the non-profit until it was done. And it was done in a matter of months, surprisingly fast and really well. I had never seen anything like this. These three flannel wearing nerds were fucking lions at getting what they wanted and I almost couldn't keep up with their energy.

And they managed to do all this while actually having a life, we went on a trip to Mexico as a form of teambuilding.

I talked to them about it after the fact and I mentioned how they've shown me an approach to things I've never seen before. One of them mentioned that everyone at Google is like this. In order to get into Google, you have to show you've got the ""Google way of thinking"" and that's exactly this proactive, hungry way of getting after what you want.

Ever since then, I've worked with multiple successful startup founders and they all share this common trait.

# ..so become a winner

The whole point of this post is to commit fully. Don't half-ass shit.

If you're going to work out, get a personal trainer or read everything you can about exercise and dial that shit in. From exercise, through macro tracking, to turning down the lights an hour before bedtime. From this point until you get your dream body, you're a bodybuilder. Say that shit to yourself. ""From now on, I'm a bodybuilder"".

If you're shit at socializing, from now on until your goals are met, you're a charismatic extrovert. You're gonna dial that shit in and go out every day. If you work from home, you'll take your laptop and work from a cafe. From now on you're the guy that talks to everyone. Say that shit to yourself and go tell that chick you're passing on the street that you like the way she did her eyeliner.

And keep in mind you can be fully locked on multiple things at once. When you've done your workout and prepared your meals, you still have time in the day to work on your other goals.  

**TLDR: In order to get into the fast lane after your financial, fitness or personal relationship goals, you have to commit fully. Don't ever half-ass anything. You either want it or you don't.**",1661953918.0

I was quite intrigued by it and i thought it may be of interest to post it here.


""The masculine is the source of love.  Surprised?

First, don't confuse tending, a great feminine trait and inclination, with love.

The masculine 'does,' and the feminine is 'done to.'

An integrated man is loving, a Nice Guy tries to be lovable.

Men love women, and women love children.

A boy can be loved by his mother but a grown man cannot be loved by the feminine.

A man can get love from the masculine, mainly his own masculine.

The feminine makes a man's life beautiful and brings him back into nature.

A Nice Guy often seeks love from a women, and makes her into a mother, while still seeking validation from sex. Obviously this can't work.

Nice Guys frequently won't go forth to penetrate the world and experience abundance because they get hung up trying to get loved and validated in a relationship ""first,"" but these relationships don't work as described above.  It's a deadlock--deprivation and neediness maintained because the Nice Guy can't stop checking and testing a mother figure for external validation (reassurance).""",1661768337.0
20,[Success Story/Field Report] FINALLY fucked a hot girl! Thank you so much TRP!!!,123,wzsmcj,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wzsmcj/success_storyfield_report_finally_fucked_a_hot/,50,"(this is a x-post from trp.red. I hope it's allowed. I just wanted to post my story here as well, maybe more people can learn from this) 

I'm 25yo white eurofag, started getting into the manosphere at 17. A bit of social anxiety

I'll spare you of the boring details, there is this shy quiet girl at work. She's a part timer, usually works 1 or 2 days
 a week and rarely talks to anyone. I thought she was pretty cute so I would talk to her from time to time. She would sometimes compliment my arms or something but nothing more.

Eventually I asked her out, I didn't want to be a pussy so I did it face to face, which was kind of difficult with her schedule. The first date didn't go that well in my opinion, we were just talking, I tried some light kino but I thought she really wasn't that interested in me so I didn't ask her out again.

Some more backstory about me, I actually lost my v card earlier this year (I wasn't really attracted to her, but I was desperate and just wanted to get it over with), before that my record was just kissing. So obviously when it comes to sex, I am very inexperienced.

Now cut to last week. I will be quitting this job and I have something else lined up, so I thought - hey why not try again. To my surprise she was really happy to see me again. In my mind she was this shy, innocent girl (oh how wrong I was... ) so I thought there was no possible way of sleeping with her.

Anyways the date goes pretty well, she seemed kinda shy at first, but she kept opening up little by little. I started with some light touches, then joking about sex, she did too and it was at that moment when I realized there is actually a chance.

We went to a park, sat down on a bench, I was showing her some photos on my phone, gently brushing her arm whatever.

Then she started holding hands with me. Oh shit. Suddenly she starts throwing shit tests at me - are you single, when was your last relationship, etc etc. I have done this hundreds of times.

I kiss her and she drops the bomb. ""We can go to your place after this, right? "" oohhhh shit. Did she just say that? I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

I was a little too excited... My first hookup! With a hot girl nonetheless!!! Guys, this girl was EXACTLY my type. Petite, Asian, short hair, 100lbs soaking wet. Really pretty.

At this point I was a little too excited. I started kissing her, and she clearly didn't like that. So I backed away.

We get to my place, and because I was not expecting this at all, it was dirty as hell. I apologize to her and ask her if she can wait in the bathroom for a moment. She obliged and my heart is racing as I'm speedrunning this shit in 90 seconds. Apparently it was good enough, she lays down on my bed (BTW I have 2 roommates so one more reason to be anxious. Fortunately they were all away at the time)

I started undressing her, some foreplay, I don't want to make this into a porn story, you guys get the idea.

I ask if she can go down on me, she says yes but you need to wear a condom. I thought it was kind of weird but whatever. Rubber BJ beats no BJ.

Then she gets on top. OH MY FUCKING GOD!!! This girl was freaky as hell!!! She was thrusting herself on me and I was worried she would snap my dick in half.

Because she was so hot I got really into it, I was going so hard my whole body was covered in sweat. I have never been so sweaty in my life. Not even after the most hardcore gym session.

Unfortunately I gave myself a death grip from watching way too much porn, so I couldn't cum but at least I made her cum. It was so crazy, her whole body was convulsing. She was so loud, it was like watching porn on full volume.

Cue another shit test - how many girls you've been with, blah blah blah. I said ""I stopped counting. More than 20 but less than 200"" ""really? You must have so many STDs"" ""yeah, it's like Pokémon. Gotta catch them all.""

I said some beta shit, which probably ruined my chances of hookup #2, but I really didn't care at that point. That was more than good enough for me.

I still can't believe it happened... It was like lucid dreaming. My fantasy come true. Absolutely surreal experience

This was such a massive confidence boost for me. Knowing I have the ability to pull hot chicks, I felt like a king of the world.

Big thanks to the TRP community. Whisper, Uncle V, GLO, Rollo, Dr Warlock and many others. You made my dream come true.

This shit really works. BTW to all the Indian guys - I'm 5 foot 7. If I could do it, you can do it too.",1661683956.0

I have declined and they persisted. I said I'm dating a girl right now. This is half true as we've only been on a few dates.

-Doesn't have anytime because she puts her kids first.

-Is Overweight. 

-Goes to school, and isn't working. 

-Uses an Alias so one of the Baby Daddy's can't find her.

-Lives with family on a property. 
-etc.

They think I'm a great catch. Good to know... so why try to set me up with this hot mess? 🙄

Compare this to the girl I've gone on a few dates with;

-Has her own house.

-Works.

-Has time to date. 

-Is in decent shape.

-Paid for a few dates. 

It is frustrating to think that some believe that a single mom like this is such a great catch. And I'm going to jump at the chance to date her? 😄🤦🏽‍♂️

I haven't had the best luck dating... but damn. They think I'm going to waste time with the single mom over this current chick? Hell no!

I'm in decent shape, have a good job, own place, I'm fairly attractive, good family, etc. The average American man like me does NOT want to wreck his life by dating a single mom. 

Why is that so hard to understand?

UPDATE - All you saying bang her. Hell nah! 

My time is valuable and I'm not going to waste it. If it fails, which it would, I'll get blamed. 

My friend knows this is a terrible match for me. He's only gone along with it since his wife is pushing it.

UPDATE 2 - The last girl they set me up with pushed me to RP and self development actually. 

That relationship totally f*cked me up for a long time.

UPDATE 3 - I told them ""Thanks, but no thanks."" several times.

Every once in a while, some new hyper masculine cock enters the public eye, and all the recovering betas here cannot help but latch onto the new thing that their enemies hate and wrapping their lips around it for a good hard suck. 

If bravado was the Red Pill, why does the Red Pill exist? If thuggish behaviour and pissing everyone off intentionally was so good, why are half the thugs you know either convicts or ex convicts They got laid, so I guess that 2 year dry spell with probation is the price you pay?

Why? Because acting like a thug are none of these things, they are shit, they always were shit, and it's very easy for slaves to replace one master with another. Tate and the 'be like me it worked for me' men online do not give a shit about your welfare. They are just using your insecurity in a marketing funnel to make money. They aren't sincere genuine people, they are curated brands, saying the right things to resonate with an audience desperate to give money so they can feel good.

Men who aren't raised by other men have a chariacture of masculinity they base off of TV, and seeing what the people who hate them hate. Feminists hate men, right? Feminists hate Tate, right? Therefore Tate is dad 2.0! The enemy of your enemy is not your friend, he's just your enemy's enemy. Nothing less and nothing more.

They don't give a fuck about you. They just want you paying them instead of someone else. Tradcons and feminists can fight their little war over whose plan to exploit you for women's sake is ""better"", the thugs can catch whoever doesn't fall into either camp but is still longing for leadership, and you don't have to be involved. Because if you actually take the Red Pill, instead of just longing for a high-T 1990s wrestling promo, then this what you already know:

You belong to you.
You exist for you.
Anyone who wants something from you had better offer you something in exchange, instead of trying to convince you it's cool.
Because being against what you hate doesn't mean you have frame, it means you're reactive and still controlled.
And if you buy into it when it hurts you, you're a fucking tool.
If you are still looking for someone to worship, you're still in beta-male suck-up mode.
Yes, that includes Jesus. If he loves you so much, why does he never pick up the phone and call?
Yes, that also includes me and other redpill dudes. We'll eat your lunch out of the fridge and steal your girl. We're just not bullshitting you, not because we love you, but because we hate bullshit.

The hate of Andrew Tate by the ""redpiller"" is a great example of this. It's sad because new redpiller will not see the truth of what it takes to be a masculine figure; bad information is being upvoted and great information is being downvoted. 

Andrew Tate is that of what every true masculine man should strive to be.

But yet feminist man hating cardio b promoters are socially acceptable. 

""But Andrew Tate is a rapist, human trafficker, misogynist, and wife beater.""
ALL of those are proven false with evidence found all over the internet, yet incels of the red pill still believes every ounce of it because they're too lazy to do the research. I guess being grouped in the masses of sheep's and chodes is easier than becoming a man. 
His women came out with a video explaining the ""beating"". The police and video evidence of surveillance cameras clearly shows the women coming in the house and staying through her own will, she was never kidnapped. Saying men and women are different is being a realists not misogynist. And rapists??? No I did not pay a single penny to Andrew. Not his HU or war room. I simply analyze and made my own judgements. A lost art in this new generation.


The truth is... I feel bad for the newer generation of men wanting to learn red pill and any parts of masculinity because it is all being WATERED DOWN. Watered down by chodes who have zero experience with women and life. Broke boys who can't afford to support an aesthetic physique.

You know how it is with movies and shows these days.
 
Wokism and white knighting everywhere.

The finale of Better Call Saul was no exception. I liked the show, but I hated the finale - and not only for the wokism. It was generally incoherent. They didn't manage to tie up all the strings.

So, I changed it.

I couldn't do much about the incoherence, but at least I removed the simping. 

How?

There's a way in the VLC video player to have a playlist with start and end times. Using it, you can cut out parts, or even rearrange scenes.

You can find my playlist here: 

https://theempressisnaked.wordpress.com/2022/08/24/better-call-saul-adams-cut-the-finale-without-the-white-knighting/

I'm not giving a file, to ease worries about viruses etc. Just copy paste the few lines, paste them in a text editor, change the name of the file to your own finale episode filename, and save it as finale.m3u

If you've seen the finale already, you can use my cut to show it e.g. to your children, and spare them the woke brainwashing.

--------

Almost all the shows that go out nowadays are unwatchable due to their hard feminist political line. I expect the same with e.g. the upcoming Lord of the Rings adaptation. Why not do our own montage, and enjoy the story our way? 

Now, is this kind of arbitrary? 

Not really. 

Think of it as an alternative  ""Director's cut"". As ""Adam's Cut"". 

In fact, I propose we adopt this term for edited versions of films that do away with the gynocentric propaganda of the ""me too"" era. Considering practically all forthcoming productions are going to be chock full of woke propaganda, this might be the time to start a movement. 

So, go ahead and do your own ""Adam's cut"" of your favorite movie or series.

-------

**SPOILERS follow**

For the ""Adam's cut"" of the Better Call Saul finale, I've done minimal editing, cutting out some parts. In the producers' cut, Saul sacrifices himself for Kim, a cliche finale - in this and every other era, really. In the version I provide, he gets off lightly, as was his initial plan - and there is a hint that Kim might even wait for him to get out of prison. And we leave it at that. 

Isn't is much better than sacrificing himself for his accomplice, just because she's a woman?

sezamus, 31, ex-military, engineer earning top 10% salary in my country. I have my own flat, car and... 30% body fat. Yes, I got back to my gym after almost a year.  


I have a friend, former bikini-fitness model. \~5'9"", great shape, great boobs, very nice personality.  
One day we were coming home from a dance class and she was telling me how some guys there were sometimes rude beyond comprehension.   
A sperg, who got to know some PUA technique called ""Neg"" (I believe you are familiar with it), used it like that:  
**Her**:-Hi!  
**Sperg**:-Hi... You're fat!  
Then, she told me how cringe it was and never wanted to see that guy ever again.

To my surprise it is not the first time, I hear about misuse of neg.   
Once I was on a date with a beautiful young woman (23), who knew how pretty she was and what effect it had on men. During the talk I complemented how nice outfit she had worn for me. She smiled, asked ""where are you looking at? Eyes up here!"" in a teasing way and told me, that some guy who had tried to go on a date with her also had thrown a spergy neg like ""oh, you are not pretty sitting that close"". Of course the result was the same. She never wanted to see that guy again.  


Both that girl and my friend said the same: ""Men became rude lately!""  
I know why. It was inevitable. They had read it about it here or in some PUA community, but understood it in an absolutely wrong way. Guess what? I made that same mistake many years ago. I called a pretty girl ""a witch"". She didn't take that well.  
Guys, seduction is not about being rude.  
The purpose of an accurate neg is to create playful teasing, to joke, show self-confidence after you have some rapport with a woman.   
E.g.  
Her: -Last weekend I did this, that and...  
\-(I pretend to fall asleep) Oh yeah..., so interesting! I think I left the iron in the oven, bye!  
\-Oh come on! What did you do?!  
\-Cool people stuff. You wouldn't get it.  
But! All this in a playful, smiling manner. A neg should first of all be a playful way to set comfort. Yes, comfort, becasue a thirsty man shooting complements all the time is the opposite of it.",1661217661.0

The type of music I write, however, is very calm, meditative, reflective, and also a bit mellow (I'm going to have a couple examples similar to my writing style at the end of this post that I urge you to listen to. They're very beautiful pieces of music). A friend of mine described it as ""pretty music that feels like a nice hug"".

The problem is that through all these years I've used music as a tool for expressing my pain and anger- I was always emotionally volatile until very recently when I started exploring stoicism and becoming more in control of my emotions. I am now very capable of controlling my reaction to things, but because of this my approach to writing music has changed and I don't know how I can overcome it. I don't feel emotions to the same intensity that used to drive me to pick up a guitar or touch a piano and find a way to express them anymore. 

As an artist, I feel it is my duty to reflect how I view the world as accurately as I can- and if everything isn't as emotionally strong to induce a similar reaction in the listener when experiencing it, my work will not only get boring but my aim to provoke any kind of response to it would have failed.

 I haven't released any music for the last 7 months because primarily I was focusing on finishing university, but I was also just lost because of this. I couldn't even go to my professors for help, because they're all grown children. Every week or so I get a dm from someone new asking when I'd be releasing something new, and my desire to continue making music is stronger than ever. My purpose is to keep creating ""pretty music"" that offers whoever is experiencing it a place of comfort and the ability to reflect on stuff, but that has been challenging for me because the requirement for this is to experience emotions very strongly for a long period of time- long enough to finish writing something. 

And I can't do that anymore. I usually just meditate or go workout, sometimes I journal, and I move on. I am also an actor, so maybe if this shit doesn't work at the end of the day I can just pretend to be a different person and try writing- but then it wouldn't be genuine. I have no urgency to make this change- all my work is ""creative"" work but it's going okay. I have the luxury of time. This is just another obstacle I have to get through as I keep growing, and in time, I will.

My aim for this post is to create a discussion around current artists/creators who are ""masculine"" (or at least fit your description of it), because at least in my little bubble I feel there's a lack of those. It would also be cool hearing other people on this sub who are more experienced in the arts than me to give their two cents. Or maybe I just need one of you to kick me in the ass and call me stupid for even thinking this and get on with writing, because at the end of the day this *is* a writer's block.

Thank you for reading this post.

Here's a few songs I've been listening to a lot lately that I feel are similar to my writing style, and the type of music I'm drawn towards writing and exploring:

28,[FIELD REPORT] My first cold approach ever. Come laugh at my cringe.,110,wuben1,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wuben1/field_report_my_first_cold_approach_ever_come/,34,"It’s been a year since I started cold approach so I thought about writing a different kind of field report today. I’m going to post my first approach ever. My god, just writing this FR makes me cringe from embarrassment. I was fucking bad at this back then, but hey, we all start somewhere right?

I started cold approach a year ago because I was extremely displeased with my nonexistent dating life back then to a point where I was borderline depressed. All other aspects of my life were pretty great. I was fit, educated, good career, high income, just moved back to my hometown where my family and friends are. Yet, I was struggling with girls immensely. It irritated the hell out of me. I did everything society told me to do and, yet there I was, with no prospects. OLD was complete garbage for me as it has been for the last 8 years. I tried social circle game by going to meetup groups and hiphop dance classes. Essentially a waste of time if you’re trying to meet girls. I had a choice to make: keep doing the same things or make a change and take massive action. I chose the latter.

I’ve always known about cold approach/PUA, however, I was always too afraid to try it. My first “session” was at the mall. I went to the mall with the sole intention of cold approaching girls. I even thought of and practiced the opening line: “Hey, excuse me, I saw you from afar and thought you were extremely gorgeous and just thought to myself that I have to meet that girl or I'll regret it for the rest of my life” LOL… ugh so cringe. Anyways, I got to the mall and spent 2-3 hours trying to approach girls. Guess what? I couldn’t do it. I was too fucking scared. The most I did that day was ask a girl where X store was. I spent 2-3 hours at the mall walking around like a clown only to ask a girl where X store was. Big clown energy. I know. So I didn’t even count that as an approach. I left the mall that day and was thinking “fuck, this is fucking hard. How am I ever gonna do this?”.

A few days later, I went to a minigolf meetup event. It was so lame and such a waste of time. As always, it was a sausage fest, there were barely any girls, and when there were girls, they weren’t attractive. After the event, as I was leaving, I saw this girl working at an empty ziplining store. She wasn’t even that attractive tbh but I was like, this is it, I need to fucking approach. There’s nobody else around so there won’t be any public humiliation. I legit walked past the store back and forth like 2 times before I went inside for the approach. I was so fucking nervous. My heart was pounding, it felt like it was going at 150bpm. I even had to take a seat at a bench to collect myself before going inside. I finally mustered up the courage for the approach after like 5-10 minutes of pondering and preparing my opening line. I went inside and instead of leading with my opener, I froze and just started asking her about ziplining LMAO. After like 60 seconds of inquiring about ziplining, I said, “Actually, I don’t really care about ziplining. I was walking by and I saw you and thought you were kinda cute and wanted to meet you. So I thought to come in to say hello and see if you’re single”. She responded with “oh sorry I have a boyfriend” to which I responded with “oh okay, well he’s a lucky guy”.  LMAO. Jesus christ, just end me.

So that was my first cold approach ever. I actually walked away from that approach feeling pretty good. I was just happy I did an approach, however, I didn’t find the surge of motivation to get serious with cold approach until after my first night game session (you can read about that under my post history). 

That was all a year ago. I can definitely say that I'm the most confident I've ever been with women at this point of my life. A comparison I like to think about is during 2019, I remember trying to escalate on a girl during a date and my heart was racing. Now, I'm cool as a cucumber when I interaction and escalate with girls. I’ve learned so much in the last year, made new friends, met thousands of girls, hooked up with dozens, made out with hundreds. Here’s to another year of pimping.",1661118768.0
29,What’s the end game,71,wub35t,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wub35t/whats_the_end_game/,34,"Heya dudes

I had a lurking period on this subReddit a while back when I went through my whole “taking the red pill moment” but I don’t come here as often anymore. 

I assume it’s because when we went through our moments, we learnt and applied.

(God, I thought I had learnt and cracked the code to life when I first got into bed with a girl!)

However, when I look now at some of the posts on this page, I feel we may have forgotten what the end game is. The end game isn’t more sex, more plates or more indifference to rejection. 

The end game is understanding who we are, to put us on a pursuit which will continue to keep us on our toes. It is a pursuit which continues regardless of how we evolve, because we continue to strive to be better. Nobody sits down after a massive cut and thinks “wow I guess I’ll just maintain this physique from now on”. 

Same for your career, sex life, and overall well being. 

I saw a video recently - I can’t place who was talking about this but I’ll try to paraphrase what the idea was:

If your end game is to have more sex and meet women, you will end your pursuit of self-betterment as soon as you achieve such things. 

When I started on my red pill journey, I honestly only wanted more sex and validation from women. 

I ate 2000 cals a day, and ran 10km every single day I could, to lose 20kg overall. The bottom line is that the wise men on this group taught me about being lean, game, and much more. And I learnt, and applied! 

I went through a super cool renewed-version-of-me summer but I felt empty because I had never had the attention and love of a woman. And thus, I dove head first into a relationship. 

It was good for a while but I treated this woman like garbage for close to a year and a half because I didn’t think you could be any other way with a long term partner. I honestly regret how I was. 

But I had love and attention, so I had finally achieved what I wanted when I first came to this sub. 

I then got complacent. 

I got fat, I started drinking everyday, I became lazy and lost sight of my own future. 

In essence, I forgot what the red pill had taught me because I had achieved what I thought the red pill would bring me. 

Which brings me to question of what the red pill really teaches us. 

On a surface level, the red pill brutalises the concept of increasing personal value to achieve a better sex life. I think it’s incredibly effective - I’m not complaining. It dramatically changed the course of my life (judging from how the past three years have been)

However, the deeper idea in taking the red pill, I would contend, is:

1) to put us all in a journey where we self-analyse and attempt to better ourselves. 

2) understand our own flaws, and work on them. 

3) learn how both items above massively impact the rest of our lives. 

If you’re a dude in the lurking phase, learning what the red pill is, please go out and try every fucking thing your brothers talk about here. You will learn so much about people. 

If you already went through a journey of self betterment, and have achieved your short term goals, please remember what the red pill teaches you. 

Don’t get lost and fall prey to habit once you achieve what you came here for. 

The pursuit of self must always continue. The rest always follows.",1661117971.0
30,Modern dating is just fucking for older women,315,wty00q,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wty00q/modern_dating_is_just_fucking_for_older_women/,107,"**A woman new on the dating app scene** will be enamored by the attention- so many options, often exceeding her wildest fantasies. A gym-rat in his early-thirties, looking to relieve a bit of stress after leaving the office; the twenty-four year old bartender; the frat guy cheating on his teenage girlfriend; everyone vapid and interchangeable- all chasing a woman over forty. She always knew she could do better than her husband- and with the maturity of age, now she’s comfortable enough with her sexuality to indulge without regret.

And even if she had more fun than she ever thought were possible on those lonely nights, sitting under the glow of her television, with an open bottle of wine, playing and replaying the eventual conversation she’d need to have with her husband; even if she had gotten to live out the female version of every man’s fantasy, with the only limit being a time predestined by her own genetic code, a threshold causing the attention to taper- she’ll one day realize that coldness had always surrounded her, even if she couldn’t always feel it.

**\[Excerpt from:** [**WELCOME TO HELL**](https://www.amazon.com/Welcome-Hell-Bad-Billy-Pratt/dp/195189751X)**\]**

**Lesson:** I thought of my poor old Dad last night when talking to a female friend about a friend of hers who's been ""doing the dating app"" thing after she'd gone through her divorce. Part of it has been great- men everywhere! Taking her out! Taking her on vacations! Dinners! Wineries! Sexy young men! Wealthy older men! 

She had felt so lousy and dejected after her divorce that all the attention had made her feel like she was in college again.

That's part of it.

The other part is that **she drinks more than she ever has and cries just as much.** After every conversation about *keeping things causal*; after every text she gets the next morning, *last night was great but I don't think we have chemistry*, despite him fucking until the blue chew wore off... It's the same story, every single time, and now she expects it like clockwork.

I thought of my poor old Dad last night, the time he explained to me, as a teenager, that none of the girls I was palling around with on the phone- on school nights, as they'd gossip about boys they liked- were actually going to be *my girlfriend*. They were just using me...

As I explained to my friend, about her girlfriend using these dating apps. **None of these guys will want her to be their girlfriend.**

Funny how it switches like that.",1661083464.0
31,Social norms favors women too much,161,wt03qx,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wt03qx/social_norms_favors_women_too_much/,66,"In today's society the most important thing to relationships is being sexually loyal, while emotional loyalty is not needed, and in many ways considered irrational. 

Emotional loyalty is harder for women to do, but it is only fair they do something hard if they want to force the man to face something hard too. 

Someone not liking bacon telling their partner to not eat bacon aren't on the same playing field. A woman naturally has less sex drive, and her sex drive in most cases is tied to her emotions. So mindless random sex to the woman is something easy to avoid if they are emotionally happy, but the way men work it is much harder and takes an actual toll not to indulge in desire (same toll as not having a close opposite gender  friend, or more emotional outlets in general) 

In the past patriarchy and religion had it right in some way, it forced sexual jail on people, but at least it forced women to endure emotional jail. in a perfect world we wouldn't need any jail, but having both jails is better than sexual jail being the only thing to exist.  I hate patriarchy, I hate religion but I hate feminism more than both. Religion in sex negative, so is feminism. 

Considering this it makes perfect sense to forbid women who want monogamy from having close friends of the other gender, but it today's society it is considered controlling to expect what is only fair. 

I am not red pill btw, I disagree with many of the RP ideas but this subreddit seems one of the few places I can leave this rant in.",1660976515.0
32,I lost my virginity last night. Field Report,180,wrpl9a,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wrpl9a/i_lost_my_virginity_last_night_field_report/,107,"I (M22) was invited to an F29's house at 9pm last night. I had never met this woman before so it was quite bizarre that she was willing to give her address to a complete stranger.

I met this woman off a dating app, and interestingly her profile said she was looking for ""chatting / friendship"" only,

She is Mexican and didn't speak English very fluently, so we communicated through Google Translator on her phone. I think we both enjoyed this since it was a different way to communicate.

I never once touched her without approval beforehand, which built trust between us greatly and was definitely one of the most important factors at play.

Body language was also extremely important, as she insisted on sitting beside me in her home to the point where she was breathing on me, and kept moving her leg to touch mine. Sometimes I would purposely move away and she would close the distance.

There was a lot of last minute hesitation because I was a complete stranger she had just met and was 7 years younger than her, but I focused on positive reinforcement and making her feel good to get over the concerns.

I was extremely blunt and forwards with the things I typed in to her translator. Like I didn't waste time at all I just told her exactly how I felt and what I wanted to happen. A lot of the stuff I said would probably be quite creepy if she didn't find me attractive, but I was already aware that she liked me so I was okay with my word choices.

She had some roommates so we blasted Stranger Things season 3 and Squid Game to mask the noise. We showered together after. The best part of it all was no longer being touch starved and having a cuddle buddy.",1660844047.0
33,By all means redpill doesn't mean a man has low Integrity and dignity where they just pump n dump women,18,wlhozs,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wlhozs/by_all_means_redpill_doesnt_mean_a_man_has_low/,65,"https://youtu.be/DGbf-aK3YxU 

Something that caught my attention about redpill they seem to have good points on self improvement, However I feel like they have low value standards when it comes to sex.

We are creating what we make the world to be everyday, I would like to live in a world where a man and women are virgins till marriage as it is important to each other

 A world where porn doesn't exist

As much as that utopia would be nice to have such high values, the world is unfair and it won't really go that way

Most of us have been numb thinking it's alright or we're used to all that sex culture drug culture drinking culture etc

It's not really the best choice out there for our happiness longterm.

Alright let's take an example since most of you won't really get what I'm pointing at.

Is it really alright for you guys to have your mom to have a bunch of strangers dicks in her mouth/pussy/ass, before your dad and you being born? or even after your born?

Or what about your daughter /  gran ma/  sis / aunt family etc

Of course not, most of you wouldn't find it ideal,

 Why would you do that to someone else's mom / daughter /  gran ma/  sis / aunt family etc

Or what about your daughter /  gran ma/  sis / aunt family etc ? 

Our brain's have been getting insensitive/desensitized to such stuff, our brain receptors dopmaine/sertonin whatever centers are being fried, drugs make you think like your on to something or your right but it damages your outview, critical thinking, makes you think your right and you choose these decisions consciously when your not, Even if it's a little intake.

That's scary that it impairs you for long that it might take years for you to get that your in that spot, and neither is the cult that we're in is even helping progress on any of this.

I mean basically we lost our common sense on what's normal, and let me be clear this is very abnormal and immoral, but that's what the world seems to be turning into sadly.

That's my 2cents, and of course nice guys never really get rewarded, just as the good girls that are into self improvement get taken advantaged off, unless if either side is lucky.

Hoping this message is a seed to make this world a better place for us all, to look out for each other and make a safer healthier world.

Thank you for reading.

Edit: I'd like to drop this link as i feel porn affects are very underrated longterm for true clean bonding/intimacy between two https://youtu.be/hzPylqS01qU?t=511

Edit: As for women, a man cannot do this alone, this message has to be passed to them too, I hope a woman out there does seed a message like this to them too.",1660190168.0
34,MINDSET - Part II of Inner Game,234,wk8vuq,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wk8vuq/mindset_part_ii_of_inner_game/,22,"Dear reader,

I'm gonna call you a loser here and there. That's only because you are one :)  
Get offended by that, and use it as a fuel to become better. Anyway.

Mindset is everything. As i mentioned previously you cannot change the things that happen to you, but you can change how you react to them. In fact, the only thing you can change is your mindset. Everything else is outside of your power.

This post, unlike the previous one, will focus on things you can do right now to have a better mindset. And it won’t be too long because i shortened the list for one reason: INTERNALIZE.

Because you can read all you want, until you start implementing the things i write you will still be in the same spot. Same person. Here we go.  


* **The Basics**
   * Sleep, drinking water, eating enough (not too little nor too much). Don't do drugs, cut the alcohol to the minimum (don’t get hammered every day). Take care of yourself physically. The brain is an organ after all. Meditate, journal. Find a hobby. Have a social life. Stop watching porn.
* **I can do anything i want**
   * Believe it. You can achieve everything if you put your mind to it. You can become the best at everything as long as you work for it. Remember that, internalize it. You can achieve whatever you want.
* **I am responsible for my life**
   * God won’t give you wings, he won’t make you a billionaire while you lay in bed watching “Friends”. The fuck are you doing you loser? Is this the life you want? Is this the life you dream about? Nobody is going to change your life. Get up and do it yourself. Get pissed off at your current situation. Why don't you have a Lambo? Why do some guys have 10 girls and you have none? Get angry. Change your life. Nobody else will do it for you.
* **Your word is your command**
   * If you say something you better do it. If you said ""I will go to the gym today"", you no must go to the gym. Whatever you say you have to do it. Using this principle, you can now just say stuff you know you should do but are ""tired"" or ""lazy"". Now you have to do them. I am going to approach 5 girls today. And you HAVE to do it. Because your word is set in stone. You cannot back off now that it was spoken into existence. I will build a business, and now you have to work for it to build it. Simple right? There is your motivation right there. Never lying to yourself. Staying true to your word.
* **Know your enemy**
   * When you don’t go to the gym, your enemy does. When you don’t approach a girl your enemy approaches her. In the end, he is jacked & has a 10/10 sucking him off. And you are alone at home with a beer belly. Think about it. Everytime you don’t do it. Your parallel universe YOU does it. Do you wanna live in the “success” universe, or in the “loser” universe?
* **“I know that i know nothing”**
   * Shut up. Oftentimes people just talk too much. Bragging, and talking their mouths off about things they already know. Shut up and listen. You can learn from anyone. Realize that you know nothing, even if you know everything. Still be willing to listen, learn, explore.
* **I AM ALIVE**
   * Scientists say the odds of you being born are at least 1 in 400 trillion. Why are you wasting your opportunity being a loser? You just won a lottery, you got the gift life. Use it.
* **Don’t take yourself so seriously**
   * Self explanatory. Life is fun. Girls are fun. Sex is fun. Have fun. Stop thinking so much.
* **Don’t chase happiness. Understand your emotions.**
   * Chasing happiness is the worst. Why do you want it? You don’t chase anger all the time. Anger is also an emotion. If you were happy with your life you would get nowhere. You would just lay down, happy, with a smile. Fat and useless. You should be angry you don't have a life you want and deserve. Make a dent in the universe. Use emotions, use anger, to achieve greatness. Like with women, if you chase emotions you will never reach them. So don’t strive for happiness, strive to live your life to the fullest of your ability. Live in the present. Meditate. Don’t chase anything. Be content with the present moment. Ask yourself, why do i feel this emotion? And find the source. Maybe because you were a pussy and did not approach that girl on a bus. Or maybe you feel kinda awesome because you did approach her adn got a number. Rewire the negative thoughts as soon as they pop up in your head. Have hobbies and a social life. Negative emotions are a  response to not fulfilling your true potential.
* **Ooh La Laaaaa**
   * In the book of pook there is a post named like that. What do you think of when you see a hot girl? “Will she like me” “Do i look good” “Is my hair good” “I’m not at her level” ""Bla bla bla"". FUCK THAT. Ooh La Laaaa is what you think. No thoughts of self doubt. Accept your masculinity. This helped me a lot during my learning. Think of her as a hot girl, which she is. And adopt the mindset that every girl in this world loves you. They probably don't love you, but you thinking that they do is what is important.
* **Learn what gets you into a FLOW state of mind**
   * Flow is when time passes by quickly. When everything you say or do is perfect. It matches with your energy and with YOU. Google “flow state”, do some homework.
* **Discovery**
   * “Finding yourself”, as cliche as it sounds, is a real thing. How many of you know what they want out of life? What is your “frame” of life? Find your values, your principles. Stick to them. What are your  goals… Find your frame. What do you like and dislike, state your opinion, discover your OWN opinion on things. Don’t read it on reddit and adopt it as your own. Form it yourself.
* **Write down your goals**
   * I’m not going to write how to do this. Read the above things. You can achieve everything now, and you know that you want to live in a “success” universe. What does that universe look like? If you could achieve everything and anything, what would you want to achieve?
* **Be grateful**
   * As stupid as it sounds, writing a gratitude journal will help tremendously. Start writing one as soon as you wake up. And you will notice that after a month, you wake up feeling awesome. Feeling grateful. I hate mornings. If you speak to me before i get my coffee i will litteraly break your nose. But since i started doing this. I woke up feeling great. My mindset shifted to things i am grateful about and happy about. Try it yourself.

*(instagram:* ***@ captainmorpheus*** *- i will publish an ebook about inner & middle game (middle game being something new i see nobody is teaching!! ). Don't miss out).* 

I finally sat down and wrote this. I can expand a lot on mindset. But this are some ""core"" principles. If you men like this post i will write another one. Introducing Middle Game concept, which i really think is the best way to learn game. Anyway. Let me know in comments. 

Love, 

Your QuantumShit00.

P.S.   
\- Do 30 squats before proceeding!  
\- Do 20x3 pushups every morning from now on (say it out loud so you have to do them)  
\- Drink more water.  
\- Read a non-fiction book every morning for 10 minutes instead of looking at the phone.  
\- Every day, do one thing you are ""SCARED"" to do (approach a girl, cold shower, compliment a cashier...)  
\- Download [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and learn to use it. You can choose a template where you can track goals & tasks. You can also journal in there, take notes, write and stuff. I just started using it. It helps organize your day so you can stop being a loser. Do all the above and track it in notion.",1660065228.0

Listening to rap music. Rap music has more narcissists than any genre. It promotes terrible things and the culture is very degenerated. If you want a happy relationship, someone who listens to rap is more likely to be promiscuous, have a drug problem, and more. Many people who listen to rap tend to be depressed and have no purpose in life.
Next is body modifications like colored hair, tattoos, and excess piercings. This is a sign that they are un happy with who they are, or they follow trends to fit in or they want to stand out which means they lack self esteem. Its ok to stand out through exceptional achievements and ability, but changing appearance in a way other than hard work like exercise is usually not healthy. 


More red flags

Each additional partner means the last relationship failed, meaning they pick bad partners; bad decision making or keep making mistakes in the relationship that got them broken up with


What to look for in a man


If they play video games it's a massive red flag. They probably have no purpose, goals, or ambition, which is why they waste their time. They need purpose and ambition. Drive to achieve something worthy. They need good morals and to be competent; smart and able to work hard and succeed. Something that you would love to see him achieve. Something you want him to achieve.


What to look for in a woman


Does she go to college? If she does, a family is not her priority. She will also have debt, be brainwashed by the agenda of the colleges, and be influenced by the common degeneracy of college culture. A woman should have kids while she is most fertile; in her prime. If she goes to college and has a career, she isn’t planning to have kids until she is past the wall, or her girls will only be half of her attention.
How does she dress? Does she respect herself and cover up, or does she dress like a slut in order for the attention, love; and validation she never got from her father?
Hows the relationship with her family? If she doesn’t like him, she will probably have trouble respecting any masculine man.",1659813641.0

The contemporary woman is a [disorganized, unregulated Body Without Organs adrift in a sea of Capital](https://i.imgur.com/iV9VY5f.jpg) bereft of internal logic or consistency. No amount of lukewarm stoicism or self-help porridge is going to change this basic socio-economic fact. No amount of defensive oedipalization aka gender role reenactment can quench a contemporary women's thirst for annihilation on the altar of pharmaceuticals, social media and career.


Optimism is for cowards. It takes courage to understand contemporary women and realize their problems are not of your doing, despite the projections to the contrary. It's not your fault that her negligent alcoholic father slumbered in his own piss unable to provide desperately needed love to his crying daughter in 2003. You can't change what happened. Nor can you fix what happened, because she enjoys her symptoms too much to let you. The best you can hope for is to joyride her naked body down the slippery corpse of Western civilization. This isn't about dominating women and making them submit, as there is no merit in vanquishing people forsaken by their own God. This is about doing the best with what you're given, which is to say a [psychologically unstable woman and a society in precipitous decline.](https://i.imgur.com/CV1gkzi.jpg)


**Extract The Maximum Amount of Sex Out Of Women**

The modern woman is in your life for a good time not a long time, which is why it's imperative for you to extract as much sex as possible while she remains in your company. Think of her as a leased oil well in a third world country and yourself as a Chinese Petroleum corporation specializing in maximum exploitation, deep drilling and environmental negligence. Rather than wasting time in redundancy repeatedly imitating empathy and compassion on first dates, cut costs and maximize profit by extracting more sex per woman. When you're opportunistically dick-drilling the mentally damaged (aren't they all at this point) you need to maximize profit by going as deep and as hard as possible during your limited window of opportunity.


When you blindly outsource the burdensome task of mate selection to the posthuman cybernetic entity that is the Tinder algorithm, sometimes you have the pleasure of meeting a woman whose [medicine cabinet and night stand are overflowing with prescription pills](https://i.imgur.com/TlUipOf.jpg). With great risk comes great reward. The pharmacological deterritorialization that makes her a great lay also makes her a danger to yourself and others. When sleeping with these kinds of women DO NOT SLEEP. These people absolutely cannot be trusted around your vulnerable naked sleeping body. Take a page out of the Wehrmacht's playbook and use powerful compounds like Amphetamine or Adrafinil to keep alertness high while behind enemy behinds. Counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of harsh stimulants with a vasodilator like Viagra. Compensate for the dehydrating effects of the aforementioned substances by stocking up on coconut water or Pedialyte. Finally make sure to follow my [Semen Demon Cum Maximization protocol](https://archive.is/sBUWE) 7 days out from your drug fueled 8-hour sex marathon.


**How To Have a Drug Fueled 8 Hour Sex Marathon**

Provided you are young, healthy and exercise regularly you ready to follow the path of sexual visionary Hunter Biden. If not, you will suffer a cardiac event drowning in your own blood atop a mattress that regularly receives more DNA than 23andme. On the other hand, perhaps there is no better way to go than by having your heart burst while giving a Butt-Nut-Slut your King Kong Shlong. So, if you do decide to give in to your suicidal impulse of sheer molecularizing desire, don't let me stand in the way of your dreams.


The most important aspect of having sex for 8 hours is going into it with both eyes open. This is not about love, emotional intimacy or even lust. All of that could be accomplished by the 25-minute Saturday morning sex your dad bestowed upon the hardworking Mexican housekeeper while your mother perfected her breathwork at Yogalates. You're not a silly Seinfeld-watching, Gen X suburban dad compensating for a dead marriage and a long commute. So don't fuck like one. You're a drug-fueled emotionless terminator leaving humanity behind atop a shaking, rambling mess whose name is not important. Acknowledging others unnecessarily imposes limits upon the self, creating a cycle of servitude bereft of exploration or spontaneity.


This can only be justified through the Will to Power. This is the sex act without ornamentation, perversion or fantasy. If anything, it's an athletic event or perhaps an extreme sport.  It cannot be reduced to the pleasure principle as it goes past the point of simple enjoyment. This is death drive. It is an act of pure willpower to negate yourself inside the body of another melting into nothingness. Given enough time, sex melts all recognizable stable individuality leaving behind an absolute negativity devoid of ego or attachment. Transgression is knowledge. He who transgresses not only breaks a rule. He goes where others do not. He knows something they don't.


**Dragging Women into The Shadow Realm with Your Demon Dick**

At some point you will reach a runner’s high. You may start to notice other sensations that were until now only in the background. Nothing is a certainty, but if anything draws entities without bodies its strong emotion, psychosis-inducing drugs and the warm smell sexual excretion. Between 3 and 4 AM is the sweet spot for this about ⅔ of the way through.

This is where the boundary of our reality is semi-permeable. If you have the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of John Dee, Shabbetai Ẓevi or Aleister Crowley. Beware the Machine Elves, for they will tempt you along the way and impair your progress. You must be indifferent to them as to the homeless crossdressing hooker on the corner of Hollywood and Vine. If your concentration is strong and you can properly surf the line between sexual exertion and lucid sleep, you stand a chance to be greeted by a [representative of the shadow realm.](https://i.imgur.com/Us8He5B.jpg)

This is the jackpot. Some people spend thousands of dollars at meditation retreats and waste decades in search of gnosis, surrounded by dirty flee-ridden hippies. Gross. Avoid the lines, wait and hassle. Take the fast-track easy pass by piloting a tattoo-covered, drug-fueled, social media addicted female ship into Hades to enter into dialogue with the shadow people. It’s not really about sexual strategy. It’s about using sex as a strategy. Let’s be honest, the ultimate Red Pill is speaking with the shadow people and following their advice. Now that's self-improvement.

Who the fuck am i?

This post, amongs couple of others got taken down at other subreddit. Some of the readers that got the glimpse of it before it was taken down suggested i post it here because you guys would like it.My plan was to wake some people up to the truth over there. But moderators thought differently.Anyway.

Haven't been on this sub since it was shut down. It's good to be back tho. I wonder what old school legends that are still here, that i looked up to, will think of this. Would love to discuss it with them. Enjoy.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first letter in the series i planned. It will litteraly fuck your brain to success. Wake you up to what the world looks like. Next post will be about your mindset, and how you need to look at the world to succeed.

This is the real world, welcome.

Get a beer, soda, coffee, or whatever the hell you prefer. And let's begin. There is a lot to digest.

# Yourself

* **What is a high value men**
   * Takes care of his body & mind. He knows what he wants out of life and out of relationships. He is social and has a good sense of humor. He knows who he is, or at least who he wants to be, he has goals, and is constantly striving to get there. He is unapolegethic. Has sets of values, principles, view of world. His own set of beliefs. He acts according to them. And he knows that some of them might be wrong according to some people, maybe he is not perfect, but he realizes that is okay. He is always in a good mood because he trusts himself and he knows whatever happens he is going to be fine. That is core confidence. Having his own reality and living up to it. So, be yourself because that place is not taken yet.
* **One thing women crave**
   * Women want attention. Everything they do is to get attention. Use this as a tool to drive them away, or to pull them in. Attention is the currency of female world, another currency is emotions.
* **Emotions**
   * Emotions have no place in mans life when he is talking with women. All they want is attention, emotions will make you give them what they want. Be rational, stoicism will help you with this. Never argue with her, if you can’t reply anything nice, ignore her. Don’t let her take control of your emotional state. I don’t say dont feel emotions, just dont react to them. You need to be like a rock. Use lack of attention as punishment, raising your voice and spilling emotions to her will do nothing most of the time.
   * ""I Love you"", let her tell this first. Don't be that guy that rolls over after sex and whispers this in hear ear. I do love women, but love for us is different. You need to stay a challenge, and if you say it first it means she already got you.*“Listen, smile, agree, and then do whatever the fuck you were gonna do anyway.”* ― *Robert Downey Jr*. Be a wild horse, a stallion, running free, never tamed. But let them think they can tame you.
* **Only sexual ones get the girl**
   * Only men who are sexual will get the girl, else you will end up in a friendzone. Be upfront, give compliments, touch her, strong eye contact, sexual undertone... Show her you have a dick and a set of fanily jewels. Don’t let her think you are dickless.
* **Getting girl is not success**
   * Reaching your goals is success. Women are just a seasoning. Making a bland world much more wonderful and enjoyable.
* **EGO**
   * Ego is the enemy. But only if you let it become one. In order to be successful and dream big you need HEALTHY DOSE OF EGO. Not ego in a sense of proving yourself to others or being a little bitch and letting emotions dictate your actions. Let your ego loose sometimes, when you are dreaming big. When you are trying to succeed you need it. Just keep it tamed. Don’t let it destroy you. But don’t kill it completely. *Ego is not always the enemy.*
* **Money & looks**
   * Looks give you a permission, a foot inside the door. Good looking men are naturally confident because of their looks which gets them more women. By the way, anyone can be a good looking man. Start lifting, start eating right, get a nice haircut, grow a stuble. And you will look better than 80% of men. Women will tolerate more shit from attractive men. Getting that V taper is important. But it is not quite enough.
   * Money makes men interesting. Because girls want only one thing: to have fun. But money alone will get you gold diggers, which you dont want. I dont want them. Money also gives premission to be arrogant, confident, ""because he is successful and therefore high value"". Or on a mission, driven to succeed in everything he does. Skills you learn while making money, especially sales, are applicable to game. And vice versa. You are selling yourself. Influence is also a money making skill that will get you women. Persuasion also. By making money you automatically get qualities of a high value man: Confident, driven, abudnance mindset, fun, doesnt give a fuck…. Get on a mission, start working towards a goal.
* **In pain is the measure of a man**
   * When you are young you MUST do this one thing: indulging in painful activities. Apporaching women is scary? Do it. Fighting is scary? Train boxing and book a fight. Starting a bussines is scary? Start it. Stop wasting your time doing things that make you weak. Wathcing netflix, jerking off, playing video games. You think Muhammed Ali wasted his time to become a world heavyweight champion? Fuck no. He worked his ass off for a goal. And if you notice his demeanour, he had an ego. But used it in a right way. Read that section if you haven't.
* **Produce content, dont indulge it**
   * This comes hand in hand with making money, indulging in painful activities, and being on a mission, or having a goal. Stop watching youtube videos and starting making them. Stop scrolling thorugh instagram and looking at girls, approach them. Or grow an audience by providing value in the world instead of just taking value from it. Number one thing that successful people know is the meaning of the word VALUE. If you provide value to the world, you will get money and success in return. Hell, i learned all of this information in couple of years. And you are getting it in one day. I got it by indulging in content for years, experimenting it myself. Lots of this is stuff i read 3-4 years ago, i don't even know where. But now i am producing content and trying to show you what i learned. So, stop wasting time, start creating.
* **Being with beatiful women gives you a slight edge**
   * Being with extremely beatiful women changes who you are. It gives you this drive and passion. Women are amazing creatures. I completely disagree with the whole mgtow thinking or whatever. Yes, women are different. But STOP hating them, start loving them and accepting them for what they are. They are nature itself. Now, you can go for average girls, sure, 5s and 6s. But once you start being with trully beatiful women, the whole world will change for you. You will know what i am talking about once you start dating them when you read all my upcoming posts ;)
* **“I am enough”**
   * Every battle is won or lost before it is ever fought. Sun Tzu said that. Stop thinking you need to be an “alpha” to get hot girls. Your frame is: “I am enough.” Your frame is NOT “I’m a badass alpha who’s better than everyone”. Eliminate self-destructive beliefs. Stop the though as soon as it pops in your mind. “i am scared”---- “BEEP! Feeling scared makes me excited and pumped with adrenaline. I am so much awesome right now!”.

# Women

* **What do women want in a man**
   * A high value men. Read the whole post and you will get an idea who that guy is.
* **Women = emotional, men = logical.**
   * Women are also attracted with “body”, men with “mind”. That is why kino is so important. Everything that woman does comes from place of emotions. If she doesnt feel like going to the gym, she wont go. But a man knows “well i feel like shit but i have to go to the gym” and goes to the gym. Drama, shittests, crying. Those are all about her emotional state. And if you try to solve it with logic you are wasting your time! Remember that. Never argue with her.
   * Judge by actions not words. Girls are emotional, and what they say and do is not always congruent. They are not logical beings. Realize that. They act on their emotions. Obviously this is overgeneralized but in most cases it is true.
   * A life line consists of flat line, than upward and downward spikes, than again a flat line. This is what women want! They want their emotions to go upwards & downwards, with occasional flat lines. As i said and will say, one thing women want is fun. By being fun and making her feel emotions you are speaking their language. You are sparking her emotions with spikes. You speak the language of gina tingles. Remember that. On the other side is being boring all the time, flat lining, which is the language of virginity.
* **Perfect is boring**
   * One of the greatest lessons i learned. Never try to be perfect. Thats it. Perfect date, perfect time to kiss her, perfect hairstyle. No. Dont be perfect it is boring. Be fun and dont take her so seriously. Perfect is boring, being human is wonderful.*” Are you trying to PERFECT yourself when it comes to women or are you trying to HUMANIZE yourself that you find interacting with women as natural as breathing? “*
* **Women want a complete package men.**
   * Charming, funny, successful, inteligent… Not perfect!! Human but successful. Women dont want a gym rat, or rich, but fat men. Some do for one night stand or to take his money. But real and good women don't.
* **Mystery & intrigue**
   * Mystery and buliding an intrigue is what makes that hamster wheel spin in her head. The longer she thinks about you the more she will like you. So dont answer every question seriously. Play games. ""Lie"" about your job. Say you are an astronaut, and never tell you where you actually work. Let her brain think about it. Be mysterious.
* **Nice guy vs a jerk**
   * Imitation is suicide. Nice guy absorbs the opinions of others to please them, or to avoid conflict. Extreme masculinity is jerk. Not afraid of his own sexuality and testosterone. Having strong opinions. Not the ones he heard on TV or someone else put in his brain. No. But ones that he himself formed. He is a train never going off tracks. Use the nature, nature has given you balls and a dick to approach girls. To be a man. Lead, laugh, have your own way. Fortune favors the bold. And bold we shall be. Increase testosterone. Get on a sports team. Train. Socialize. Approach hot women. Todays asshole is a man who knows what he wants and is upfornt and blunt with it. I want sex, therefore i am sexual. He is a leader, he is unapolegetic. He realizes he is a man living his life. And he will not let anyone tell him how to live it. It is his own life and he only has this one.
* **Women dont know what they want**
   * Lead. You need to tell them what they want. IF you have a strong frame, stronger than girls frame, you will do just fine. Be a man. Act like you have answers. What is a strong frame? Fundamentally, it’s a sense of certainty in everything you do. Try testing this while texting. Write messages so she has a clear answer to write. “How old are you”, “We are meeting for a coffee tommorow”, “Do you have whatsapp”… Give them instructions. Be a leader. Show her the path. Dont let her lead, she does not know what she wants.
* **How a beatiful women sees the world**
   * Wake up, 100 unread messages on instagram. 10k likes on my picture, 1000 comments saying im beatiful…. Oversaturated. She is overwhelmed with what she wants, attention, therefore she is overwhelmed with boredom. Every guy tries to do the same thing. Trying to show off and get her attention. They put her on a pedestal. They think she is something to be won. So they act like James Bond, trying to be smooth. Not realizing she is just a girl. And what do girls want? Thats right. FUN! Make it challenging, make her laugh, you want to be like a wild horse. Instead of drooling because of how beatfiful she is, look at her separated from her beauty. Talk to her fat and ugly friend instead of her. Nobody does that, they all go for her, trying to be James Bond. She is so beatiful that only drunk guys approach her, because only they have the courage. She gets an overdose of attention and validation, which leads her to boredom. There is also a ""halo effect"" in psychology, the more physically appealing person is the more we project perfect life about said person. So, we automatically think she is perfect. Men think she is a goddess, she is always pretty. But remember, she takes a shit in the morning, she shaves her legs and armpits. Deep down she is silly, little girl, she is like a child. Like the rest of us. Looking to have fun with someone who is relaxed and open. Someone who realizes all of this.
* **You can judge a woman by how she treats those who will do nothing for her**
   * Improtant thing to realize. This will reveal true nature of beatiful girls. Watch how she treats ugly men who provide no value to her. Judge by action, not words.

# World view

* **How world works**
   * Women love sex as much as men do. They need it. But society made them think they are whores for it. You can see this when talking to them. First reaction after you say something sexual is girly laugh and then the social switch comes on and she is all like “omg not me i never like to be bent over a table and fucked silly.... wow not me”.
   * As men we are supposed to be players. We are supposed to know how to get women, and we are praised if we do know how. That is why many men don’t open up, don’t want to learn game. Because they lean towards the society side that says you should alredy know all of this.
   * Society tries to tell girls that guys with flowers, expensive dinners, giving compliments every few words, being overtly gentleman, kiss goodbye at the end of a date… are guys who they should be with. But their core wants the asshole. One who takes what he wants. They want the “alpha” because that is what millions of years of evolution told her. Only in the last couple hundred years society tries to deny that part.
   * Sex is wonderful. Eveyone loves it. EVERYONE. It is natural, beatiful and everywhere. You neighbours are fucking right now probably. If 2 people like eachother sex is natural thing that is supposed to happen next. Don’t ever judge people that hookup. Ever.
   * In todays day and age to get girls you need to show her that you are alpha and you want sex. You are sexual man. But you also need to appeal to societal norms. And show her you don’t judge her. Be unapolegethic about your sexuality, and not judgmental of other peoples sexuality. Never brag about sleeping with women, because it is a natural thing. You never brag about showering, or eating. Because it is natural. Then you become the guy who girls just get used to. He is just like that, very sexually open and does what he wants. Disclaimer : Girls will also try to bind you, they will want to be “the one”. They will invest in you. Beta males will also want to shame you. Dont give a flying fuck.
* **Mens purpose is to pass the genes as much as possible**
   * This was our purpose throughout history. To reproduce. Once you show girls you are alpha they will want to keep you. But if they turn you into beta, you were not alpha in the first place! Catch 22 for you there. Trying to make you jealous, shitests, those are tools to test you if you are alpha or beta. They want attention, they will tell you be more available, be with only me, do what i tell you to do… but secretly they want you to never listen to her. And be who you are, being a challenge *always*. I am not saying they want to be treated badly, im just saying they want a man who does not make her #1 priority and does everything she says. Those are tests to see if she can do whatever she wants to you. Lines in a sand. If you dont pass them, she loses respect and leaves you. So, never get butthurt, never go out of your way to please her, dont take her too seriously. Show her that you have a strong frame of mind and you will not tolerate her bullsht.
* **Love**
   * Love is beatiful. I hate when men dont realize this. Love is one of the things that makes time on earth worthwile. But love is not uncoditional. You should fall in love, but be ready to cut women off instantly if they don’t respect your boundaries or respect you. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Relationships should always be the result of abundance not a result of scarcity. And you can love 10 girls at the same time, who am i to differ.
* **80/20 rule, why you dont get hot women**
   * 20% of the men sleep with 80% of the women. This is true. High value man have abudnance of women. This is why you need to get in that upper eshalon of men. Those 20% of guys. If you live in a small town you know this already. There are some men who get tons of women while others never touched a girl. This is the truth. And women go for that 20% of men, why wouldn’t they? Wouldn’t you do the same thing?
* **Men are born with no value, women have value proportionate to their hotness**
   * Men are born with a blank paper, and on that paper you need to draw yourself. Create perfect version of you. Some men never realize this, and their paper is a horendous picture. Women on the other hand are born with attractive body, huge tits, ass, and hourglass shape. This is their value to the world. And they can usually bend it however they want.
* **Wake up**
   * You should begin to see that most males are wimps who bend over for groupthink and refuse to stand straight with their own conviction. Real men are rare. Be one. Decide.

Just an FYI,By reading this you are ahead of other people already. Most men think they are Casanova’s. They are not. We are all learning. By being here you are litteraly amongst the rare 0.01% of the world that have this information laid out. I could sell this for a lot of money to be honest, some people write less than this and call it a ""program"". And this is just one part of the letters!

Well u can, but u can't really be surprised. Maybe when u were blue pill, you thought it was gonna be all wholesome and nice to date and have relationships, only to discover that in reality it's a lot more cutthroat than u expected. It's understandable to feel exhausted by this, but u were born a man. This is the male condition. In humans, the number of offspring that will be produced in the next generation is limited by the number of women in a society. 1 man can get 100 women pregnant, but 100 men and 1 women leaves us with zero offspring and a dead woman. As a result of this, sexual selection is a lot harder on men. There will be winners and losers. 

If u are a loser, that's your fault. Women are just like men, they operate for their own benefit. If you are mad at them for taking advantage of their situation for their own benefit, you are stupid. That's what they're supposed to do. They are women. They are not supposed to be selected as intensly as us men. As a man, you are supposed to rise to the challenge. Nobody cares when you cry, nobody gives you free compliments, and you can't have the luxury of a passive dating strategy (just waiting for a girl to come to you and ask you to fuck her) like women can. 

When you realize this fully, it's a make or break moment for you as a man. You either become an alpha or beta by deciding yourself if you are man enough to rise to the occasion. Regardless of money, looks, career, etc (altho it does help) the main way for a man to get laid is by TALKING. That's right half of the battle is mental. You can be old, ugly, bald, but if you approach 100 women in a day in a flirty, confident way I guarantee more than 1 woman will be under the sheets with you that night. The battle is all mental.

 I see a lot of fit young men select themselves out of the dating pool before any girl does that for them. They do this by assuming rhe girl they like is out of their league, or by (when and if they finally do approach) being much too timid and afraid to talk about sex with a hot girl. 

If you know how women think and how they operate, you'd be able to get laid at a high rate just by playing the numbers game with as many women as possible. If you don't know how they operate, you may get frustrated at women as a whole and begin to hate them. To me this is a sign you already lost, as hate should be reserved for adversaries you respect, not ones that can be easily dominated",1659040006.0

I see too much of this shit on askTRP and it's killin' me. 

First off let's address the elephant in the room. 

You're dating a bitch that thinks this is okay? 

Wow. Crazy. 

I've never dated a bitch that thought it was okay, on principle, to hang out with another man, no matter how long she's known him, one on one without me present OR without at least attempting to run it by me first to gain my approval. 

All my niggas have never been in that situation either so....

But okay you're finding yourself in this little predicament and you're like ""damn I don't wanna come off as Ike Turner but I ain't tryna come off as a lil' bitch like Timmy Turner."" 

Here’s my go to phrase. 

This is all you have to say, with a raised eyebrow, and then you nod your head and keep it movin. 

Then your bitch will lose her mind, see the error of her ways, and back off. 

And all I say is ""Oh, is this what we're doin' now?"" 

Then just nod your head knowingly (as if you've been WAITING for her to give you permission to jump) and say 

""Aight then."" 

\- - -

A few years back I was dating one of my exes. It's been about a lil over a year and a half and we've established some boundaries. 

So she didn't like it when I talked to other females that weren't family members on my phone. Like me textin' them all day and night made her uncomfortable and back then I was a lot ""nicer"" (relatively) so I was like ""Okay whatever"" cause I knew that she wouldn't set a boundary that she herself wouldn't follow. 

Or so I thought. 

She had always been hasslin me about texting female coworkers and shit but her anxiety rubbed me the wrong way. It was never proactive, it was always REACTIVE. As if she didn't want me to do what she had BEEN doing. 

So I snooped through her phone and sure enough she's got like five male friends she's been chatting up on FB messenger. 

Now, I ain't give a shit - but the PRINCIPLE of the matter was that she was being a hypocrite. 

So I just started texting all of my female friends, all of my female coworkers, hell even a past fling right in front of her. 

Of course she got mad af and I was like ""Well, this is what we doin' now."" 

She pretended like she ain't know what I was talkin' about. But I ignored her and kept doin' my thang, then she finally broke down and cried and admitted that she did it because she knew that SHE'D never cheat or meet up with them but that she was TERRIFIED that I would get ""tempted"" and cheat behind her back. 

I was like damn gurl I ain't cheat on you yet. 

Obviously she saw the error of her ways but remember **there's no going backwards.** 

She was tryna have her cake and eat it too, which is what we all want at the end of the day. Unfortunately she couldn't pull one over on me so I just kept textin other bitches and she either had to accept it or leave. 

She accepted it.  

\- - -

Another example. This was back when I dated my baby mama (and she wasn't my baby's mother). 

She posted a FB status with a collage of different movie stars on it and in the comments her sister mentioned how much she was attracted to one of them. My baby mama said that she was ""honestly attracted to all of them but one."" 

So nothing is inherently alarming about that. I ain't an idiot I know that she can be attracted to other niggas, especially celebrities. 

But I knew for a FACT that if I posted some shit like that she would be blowing me up like the Unabomber. 

So I turned to her and said ""Oh, is this what we're doin' now?"" 

She was like ""what do you mean?"" 

I didn't dignify her ignorance. I just nodded my head and said ""Nah it's aight."" 

Then she started panicking and said ""It's about my Facebook status?"" 

So....she guessed right on the first try. 

Damn I wonder why? 

I just said ""I didn't know it was okay for me to post on Facebook that I'm attracted to female celebrities my bad."" 

Obviously I'm fuckin' with her mind heavy by just laying it out there like that, that's why you have to calibrate. 

Unfortunately my baby mama is one of those bitches that does shit without thinking, so she puts herself in these hypocritical situations and you have to spell it out for her. 

You know the types of bitches that thinks that the rules don't apply to her because SHE'S above degeneracy but YOU aren't? 

Well that's all females actually. 

Anyways she knows that I love me some Lucy Liu (circa Kill Bill), she knows that I have a deep collection of porn (including asian flicks - shout out to Asa Akira) and she knows that I had a previous fling with an asian bitch. 

So I was like ""But that's okay since you're setting the precedent let me let Facebook know how fine Lucy Liu is."" 

So at this point she's panicking, getting on her phone and she deleted the post. She's apologizing profusely. 

But like I said before.....

**There is no moving backwards.** 

So I posted the status. And she's being hysterical, crying and shit. I shrug cause I don't give a fuck. Told her that this is our new normal cause you know, I'm petty. 

Eventually she calms down and just accepts it. 

\- - -

Now I am not the jealous type.  I never feel threatened by another man, and I've never been cheated on. It just doesn't register within me to feel that way because like Gucci Mane said, ""Girls are like buses - miss one next fifteen one comin'.""  

That's why it's so easy for me to ""go along"" with shit. 

Yea sure I won't text no bitches.....oh wow my LTR has been texting other dudes the whole time? Cool just means that I can do whatever the fuck I want. 

It's like I always say around these parts 

She will show you what you can or can't do. 

That's because the woman is operating out of a position of weakness. She SHOULD have more to lose, meaning if she's loose with the boundaries, that means she legit doesn't give a fuck, so why should you?

If she is TIGHT with it, then she is either insecure af or she's terrified of losing you. 

Then you have some that actually have a little common sense and know how to set proper boundaries. 

Now this doesn't mean that I don't have any boundaries, it just means that when a bitch walks over the line that tells me that it must be okay for me to do that shit cause she obviously doesn't give a fuck. 

Just know that there's no turning back.",1659043778.0

We work until we're tired and sore. Trudge through what we all know are meaningless jobs. We cook up some microwave crap that has a hundred ingredients, or order cold delivery food, and put that shit in our bodies. Day after day.

41,Setting boundaries in a relationship: what it’s REALLY like,110,w8kv9f,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w8kv9f/setting_boundaries_in_a_relationship_what_its/,29,"I’m sure if you watch or follow any RP creators out there you’ve heard it spoken of as one of the great double standards of the dating marketplace…how women can have such lofty expectations and it’s her having “standards”, but if a man has boundaries of any kind he’s instantly “controlling” and “insecure”.

But have you ever really stopped to think about this concept? Have you ever thought about what your theoretical boundaries are? I’m not talking about the prototypical “must drop her male friends/not have personal social media/etc”, but more intrinsic boundaries that pertain specifically to your personality, physical, mental and emotional needs and desires?

In formulating my own over time, I’ve come to realize a few things:

-	It is a psychologically jarring experience, because we as men in particular in our former BP world were conditioned to not only not have standards at all, but to supplicate to women’s. It “feels” uncomfortable at first because you’re not used to putting your needs ahead of others.
-	For that same reason, most women are thrown off by it. It’s the programming…and because of that programming, your boundaries are *highly* likely to end potential relationships before they ever start. That’s not your fault. Most women are simply not conditioned to cater to men. It’s you who has to reprogram her. Your boundaries are a part of that.
-	You need to be congruent for these boundaries to even be taken seriously. Like much of what we have as RP aware men, it’s not a right but a privilege earned by raising our value. Any conditions you set need to be conducive to the benefit you give to a woman for her meeting those conditions. The greater the benefit, the more weight your boundaries will hold.

The takeaway here if anything is that you will feel a certain level of discomfort setting and stating your boundaries at first, but this should in no way deter you from it. Stick to your guns, hold to your standards, and if they repel any woman who you had interest in, treat it like a dodged bullet. This is all part in parcel of knowing your worth as a man and respecting your needs and desires, not putting hers (or anyone’s) ahead of your own.",1658844793.0
42,How can I be less self-conscious and stop having anxiety? How can I start having more confidence,82,w77bfx,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w77bfx/how_can_i_be_less_selfconscious_and_stop_having/,61,"Hi everyone, i'm a 21 year old guy living at home with his parents and I've been having self conscious thoughts and feeling anxious and would like to learn how I can have more confidence and stop the self consciousness and  just stop giving a fuck. My mom is overprotective and it's honestly gotten worse these past couple years since the pandemic hit so I don't really get a lot of freedom and independence at home and she won't really let me take the car out alone yet and she wants me to drive with her for a lot more times before I take it out alone, but ive been driving with her in the car for a while now at this point. It's summer time and I feel like I could be getting a lot more done since I've wasted my previous years staying at home a majority of my day doing nothing which is why I'm feeling a bit impatient about it but I guess I'll have to suck it up for the extra month and continue to drive out with her until I finally get the car on my own. But I guess this has developed into me having less confidence and being more self conscious. Everytime I go out, it has to be with a parent since my mom won't let me take the car out alone just yet, so I have gotten self conscious thoughts such as worrying about what others think about me since Im a grown man and still go out with my mom, and don't go out alone. Another example is that since a lot of people on the road don't drive with their parents, I'm basically the only one, I just have a thought that I'll see someone that I know and they see me driving with my mom and judge me for it.

 I guess the good thing is that I save a lot of money at home, and I don't get in college debt; but I can't help but think that I've missed out on a lot of fun and meaningful experiences that could've turned me into a more successful  and improved version of myself that I would've liked . Before, I used to live at a dorm in college as a freshman before the pandemic hit. At this time, I got a girlfriend for a couple months but then afterwards broke it off. I had more experiences with hooking up with a couple girls from tinder living at a dorm, and experiencing the freedom  and independence that I've never had before. Not only that, but my relationship with my family and my mother has improved a lot during this time as well. I felt good, a lot better mentally than I do right now.  I haven't had sex ever since so it's been about 2-3 years. I look at a lot of other people my age and even younger than me have a lot of freedom and able to go out and stay out late doing whatever and driving on their own; Just me constantly having to do stuff and always go out with my mom instead of by myself just made me a lot less motivated to just go outside in general since I always have to go out with her. I talked to her about it and she says things like shes gotta make sure everything is perfect before I take the car out, but I've been driving perfectly fine, and tbh, having her in the car distracts me a lot sometimes.

How can I get rid of these self conscious thoughts though? And how can I just have more confidence throughout any situation such as these situations? Because i just don't want people to see me too much as a spoiled mamas boy who can't take care of himself",1658700349.0
43,"Cold Approach to Close in One Week: All the Signs are There, Old Timers Edition",147,w59r2i,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w59r2i/cold_approach_to_close_in_one_week_all_the_signs/,42,"Because I think FRs should be instructive, the purpose of this quick report is to show what indicators of interest this recent woman threw off before we got down to business.

***tldr: AWALT regardless of age, they all throw off the same signals***

So those of you who have read my other posts, know that I'm mid-'50s, and that my target demographic is '40s and '50s. Also that I like to give advice to the older men who are just coming back into the market after divorce/death, or who are just getting sick of being a grown up incel.

**BACKGROUND**

I was out last Friday watching some live music. Yes, I went there by myself, it's what I do sometimes.

Outside, hot, stormy Summer night, at a local cidery on the side of a mountain. Very nice venue. I wanted to approach a my-age looking redhead with tight jeans and a nice spanky-looking ass, but by the time I got over to her group she had moved on.

I wound up talking with a different woman, who cares, I like talking with people \[search my posts for ""Ditch 'cold approach' in favor of 'learn how to initiate conversations with strangers' without having a goal other than the initiation itself"" for how-to talk with random people\].

**THE INDICATORS OF INTEREST**

Let's get to the list of indicators I saw when talking to her which I took as the ""go ahead"" signals:

* She would make strong eye contact, then smile and look down
* Turning her body towards me
* Asking questions about me instead of talking about herself (that's a real good one).
* Touching me on my arm, shoulder, in response to me similarly touching her first (it's called ""reciprocal action"" I think, and it's a thing, try it. People will mimick your movements subconsciously if they like you)

Doesn't seem like much, but for those of you just starting out they're subtle but once you know what to look for you'll see them. The hard part, often, is trying to keep the conversation going while not only reading these signals, but doing some minor escalation, (confidently touching a total stranger you just met can be daunting), calibrating if/how well it worked, then continuing.

It was time for me to go so I used my usual closing, as I opened my phone to the dial-pad and handed it to her, ""I'd like to hear more about \[whatever topic it was, I think it was bluegrass music\].  Put in your number and next week and go listen to some \[I think it was \] bluegrass.""

Digits obtained.

**WHAT NEXT**

Here's the fun part that many will recognize but if you're just starting out, pay attention:

I got a text from her after I left, but maybe not even 20 minutes later, saying she enjoyed talking and looked forward to seeing me next week. Big IOI.

\_do\_not\_read\_this smiles as he's rolling up the highway home, because he knows it's ""game on"" from this classic IOI - a quick text, with ""looking forward to"" in the body. Also look for words like ""love"" as in ""I loved talking with you"" and ""incredible"" as in ""I had an incredible time ...""

Then the fun starts. About 30 minutes later I get another text, she's already looked up live bluegrass and other live music for next week. Another classic: the double text.

We trade a few texts over the next few days, always I wait until she at least double texts, some times triple texts. Nothing crazy, I suspect in hindsight she just doesn't do this often. More IOIs - the double texts, the triple texts.

Last one then I'll close out. A lot of you may recognize this all-time classic: the day before we're to meet I get a selfie from her - a picture of her new hair style. Multiple IOIs in that one: she got her hair done, she wanted me to know that she got her hair done and was feeling pretty (the assumption is she did that to impress me), and she sent me an unsolicited selfie.

**CONCLUSION**

Last night I met her, did some dancing to the music, going back to her place which was closer than mine after she mentioned ""it's getting hot, I could use some air conditioning"", I won't detail those because others have done so, better, you get the idea.

Point of my post was to illustrate two things. First, to show how simple it is to read indicators of interest *once you know what to look for*. Second, to show that even for my-age women, AWALT. Older women are just older young women.

**P.S.**: the hot redhead was there and I danced a bit with her too. Planted the seed, so to speak, if I ever run into her again.",1658494005.0

45,I’m diagnosed autistic so forgive my dumb question. Is my coworker into me?,81,w3fjil,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w3fjil/im_diagnosed_autistic_so_forgive_my_dumb_question/,85,"
Hey so this girl I work with put her number into my phone, made her name a contact and texted herself through it

I didn’t even ask, I only asked for her tick tok and she did both.

We seemed to vibe really well at work but I’m socially blind sometimes so obvious cues. Is she into me?

She does not work at the store I work at normally 

She told me about her daddy issues and stuff after making a contest to see if her dad was worse or mine. I offhanded a short answer and allowed her to talk about it. I think I validated her slightly too much but I didn’t want to be an asshole about her dad beating her or her uncle trying to sleep with her when she was a kid. Just kind of direct eye contact asking if she feels ok, I only really responded with “you must have really needed to get that off your chest” she was trying to act like it didn’t bother her what they did.

We were at the register and it was baron of customers,

It was the first time I met her and she kept coming back to the register to talk to me, I would even move to like 3-4 different spots at the front and she would come talk to me

The end of the day we hung out more waiting for the next person. So that was for a few hours.

She’s 30 and I’m 25

She’s 4’10 and I’m 5’11

There was a bit of proximity happening, not too intense. 

There were tests I think but not sure ( we were talking about how she died her hair and I asked to touch it. She says no kind of smiling and I drop it, a few minutes later she said I could touch it. I kind of palmed the back Of her head without actually grabbing and I think she responded well but I couldn’t tell. Wasn’t more than a second.

I also kind of teased her for being 30 a bit “would you be mad if I handed you a cane?” She said yes but was smiling and laughing I think.

there was a bit of nose teasing (she doesn’t like her nose) but I dropped the tension with validation for a bit because by that point I had already been teasing her for too long.

Im a cashier who was visiting her store for a day, My Store Manager is going to have me work with him there more often so I’ll see everyone 
(By the way everyone seems to really like me there according to my store manager)


she just happened to be a shift supervisor. I don’t know if that speaks for something.

Does this mean something or am I looking into it too much?

Also if it’s a good sign when should I text her to lead a date? This all happened today up to 1 hour ago. I have not texted her and didn’t plan to for a day and a half 

Im sorry my post is all over the place. Let me know what you think. And remember I’m actually diagnosed autistic so don’t get disgusted with my lack of understanding, (you wouldn’t get mad at a deaf person for not hearing you well)

If you bothered reading this far thank you I would love to know what you think",1658299731.0

Ahhh yes. The title of the post is basically the message I've been receiving for the last couple of days. It's pretty annoying if I say so myself.

Now this girl was absolutely gorgeous, easily HB9/10 (since I don't believe in 10/10). Amazing face, body, a body count of 5 with myself included (a little too high for a LTR in my opinion), etc. My friends thought I stumbled on a unicorn. Throughout the entire time I was with this girl, 2.5 years, I have always told my friends that ""I'm just enjoying my turn"" and exposing everyone to some basic RP principles. Since March, both of us started losing interest. We never really did anything together. I loved to go to the gym 6x a week, work on my cars, work on my business, make healthy meals at home, work on my Youtube channel, etc. She liked to do exactly none of those. Not only that: she only wanted to watch movies, go travel anywhere, go out to eat (a pretty shit tier diet as well), etc. Just a bunch of shit I didn't want to do. Not only this, but she would push me to do this crap and I lashed out several times due to how pushy she was. My only interest lately is growing, and will always be to do so. For the last year I couldn't have given less of a shit about vacations. So when the opportunity came, I held the door right open for her to pack her shit and leave. To be honest, I didn't give a shit. One door closes, many more open.

**Where the problem begins** is when all my guy friends offering to come over and try to comfort me. I like to keep my inner circle full of those who think similarly and are financially successful. Wait a minute, aren't you guys supposed to be RP'd as well? My response is typically something along the lines of ""My mom died last year, I'm fine. This is nothing, seriously. The only woman who will truly love you is your mother. This is to be expected. AWALT. I saw this coming since the beginning and I'm surprised it lasted this long as well."" One, some, or all of those quotes; you get the picture. So almost immediately I started messaging other interests, but I had no response from a single one (since I'm being honest here). Surprising, but that's OKAY. There are many more women out there. In my opinion, if you really are RP aware, this shouldn't be anything to mourn or be upset about. Instead celebrated.

Can't make this up fellas, and I'm over having to tell them individually. I'd rather everyone know this perspective. Today I'm thoroughly enjoying my newfound lifestyle change even without plates, they will come.",1658430642.0

I am going to apologize ahead for the long post but I need some outside advice to change my situation asap

Coming out of covid it seems there are lot of lingering problems that I need to work on. One example is that I’ve been going to the gym for years to the point I am a “big guy” bodybuilding wise but going back after they reopened the gym was an uphill battle now being diagnosed with asthma. I have come to terms with my new condition after getting covid working around it in the gym by doing at least 2 miles of cardio every day and working on my posture since it got messed up at my office desk job.

*My main issue* I need help with is that I noticed my focus/concentration is essentially gone – nonexistent. If I try to read or write something, a simple paragraph will take me hours to complete like this post as an example took me nearly 6 hours to manage to get it done. I know the obvious is that I got foggy brain due to COVID along with a bunch of other things but I also didn’t help my situation by spending a ton of time playing video games, talking to friends online, watching porn, endlessly scrolling through social media, staying up really late and working from home is not necessary a good thing with these problems.

I managed to cut out all my bad habits so that most of my day is spent working from home, training at the gym and trying to self study which to no luck my focus still hasn’t returned. This is another huge factor since self studying (computer science) will better myself for the long run and it’s been an uphill battle just to open the page. I don’t want to say I am burnt out because once I got a job I took it easy for 9 months. I have just been extremely unmotivated that everything seems to make me feel tired, not in a sad/depressed way more in a no energy feel in things I once loved such as hobbies, going out, video games etc. all feel like a chore to do.

I am seeking any advice on how to bounce back to my prime pre 2018 because I tried cutting out all the nonsense but it hasn’t been working which is a problem I would like to work on immediately.

48,How to be Challenging,171,w1z2kp,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w1z2kp/how_to_be_challenging/,14,"I hate when dating coaches claim they can improve somebody’s game with “one simple line” or “one easy trick.” But there is actually one line that dramatically improved my game: when I am having a conversation with a woman and we disagree on something, I say “oh, well I guess it’s not going to work out” in a jokey, light-hearted way. For example, I might say, “oh you don’t like cheesecake, it’s probably not going to work.” Sometimes I even get up and say something like “you really do not like dogs? Well it was nice chatting with you,” and pretend like I am leaving. 

This joke may seem stupid and meaningless, but it actually accomplishes a very important function in the woman’s subconscious brain. Even if she knows you are joking, she will subconsciously feel like you are a challenge, there is a distance of power between you and her, she must work to get you, and you are “above” her in the subconscious tribal dominance hierarchy. It may sound crazy, but just by saying these few words, the power dynamic in the relationship shifts completely. Previously, my interactions and dates would sometimes fail because I seemed too interested and available, but adding this one little line completely fixed that problem. 

Being challenging also sets the frame that she is chasing you and you are not chasing her. You can even make a woman feel like she is chasing you even if she was not chasing you before simply by making a joke like this. Sometimes when I make the “it’s not gonna work out joke,” the woman rolls her eyes or looks at me like I am crazy because she was not even thinking of us in relationship terms. But it does not matter – now she IS thinking that way and about how she needs to stack up. 

Evolution determined that women must chase men, not vice-versa. The alpha male’s most important job is to focus and prosecute the tribe’s mission, so he cannot be distracted by chasing women. He can only pay attention to women who are chasing him. Women must feel like your thoughts and emotions are focused on your mission(s) (whatever they are) and you will only pay them attention and do things for them if and when they deserve it. Even if you are married, a woman should never feel like you have made an unconditional commitment to her – every day is a new opportunity for her to fuck it up. In other words, a woman should never feel like she “has” you – she always needs to feel like she needs to do something else to “get” you. You are like a valuable prize that is just within reach, but she must put a little more effort because she has not quite gotten there yet. 

The biggest mistake men make with women is not appearing challenging. When a man sees a woman he wants, he usually goes full retard and makes clear he will do anything to get her, even if she is not doing anything to reciprocate his interest or favors. It makes sense – being challenging is counterintuitive. When you like somebody, or worse, when you feel like you have met your soulmate, the last thing you want to do is imply that it might not work out. In the Disney movies the handsome prince never says to Cinderella “I don’t think it will work because you live too far.” But yet, that is what you must do. 

Women are attracted to challenging men for four reasons. First, as I have explained, higher-ranked individuals in the tribe are naturally challenging because they focus their thoughts and emotions on the tribe’s mission and not on people beneath them. Therefore, when you act challenging and establish the distance of power women subconsciously feel like you are the alpha male. Second, human beings are excited by challenges, which is why defeating a challenge is an important part of a transcendent emotional experience. Third, being challenging takes pressure off the woman. Men evolved to be predatory hunters, and that what is women see men as, so when a woman feels like a man’s thoughts and emotions are focused on “getting” her and there is no way she can slow the train down, she subconsciously freaks out. And fourth, by acting challenging, you set yourself apart from all the other men she interacts with that are not challenging. 

Humans are wired to focus on and conquer challenges. If the tribe needs ten things to survive and gets nine of those things easily, and 1 of those things is a challenge, the members of the tribe have an evolutionary imperative to focus all their thoughts and emotions on the challenging thing. If our evolutionary ancestors did not focus on challenges, they would die. Even though this emotion makes less sense in a dating context, this is still why a woman who is dating 10 attractive men will focus the one man who is a challenge and ignore the rest, even if he is not as attractive as the others. 

The essence of being challenging is that she must feel like your attitude towards her is always “maybe.” If she feels like you are “yes,” you become boring because she already “has” you and the part of her subconscious mind that seeks a challenge is no longer stimulated. You cannot want something you already have. At the same time, however, if she feels like you are “no,” she will feel rejected and go find a man who she feels like will accept her. You must stay in that sweet spot of “maybe.” As the dating coach Todd V says, you she must feel like you are “interested, but not yet sold.” 

“Maybe” is an extremely powerful psychological motivator. Humans hate uncertainty, and if there is some uncertainty on the way to something we want, we evolved to focus on that uncertainty and “figure it out” to make it certain. Scientists who study addiction have found that addicts are more motivated to chase the objects of their addiction when the reward is unpredictable. In fact, the dopamine rush an addict feels is highest when they are denied the reward. Studies of gambling addicts show that they are most motivated to gamble when the possibility of winning is exactly 50%. To put it simply, the human mind cannot handle “maybe”: we need a fucking answer. 

The spirit of “maybe” must permeate everything you do and say regarding your relationship with her. If she says something like “do you like me?,” “what are we?” or “where is this going?” your answer should always be something like “So far so good, but we will see what happens.” If she asks you to do something for her and she does not quite deserve it yet, your answer must be equivocal. For example, if I meet a woman at a bar and she says “we should hang out sometime” you should say something like “I might be able to do next week, I will let you know” even if every fiber in your being is screaming “yes I would love to hang out with you!!”

Sometimes women shit test you by being overtly sexual to see if they can control you with her sexuality. Even if a woman says something like “I want to suck your dick later” your response should be “we’ll see.” Until you are actually hooking up with her, your response to any sexual innuendo should be “maybe.” All that said, you must be very careful to not sound like you are outright rejecting a woman’s sexual advances. If she gets mad I said “maybe” I will sometimes say “maybe is the sexy thing to say” and change the subject. 

Of course, you must say “maybe” with emotional intelligence in a way that fits the context. How you say “maybe” with your long term girlfriend will be fundamentally different than the girl whose number you just got in the club. Your long term girlfriend has most likely done a lot more work to win your attention and favors than the new girl, so she deserves more of a firm “yes” about certain things. But again, you should never give an unconditional commitment. 

Even if you are a naturally challenging guy with lots of options you must show women you are challenging by doing something challenging. Women evolved to assume most men are beta so if you do not show you are challenging they will assume you are not. The easiest way to do this is to put what I call a “soft obstacle” in front of her. A soft obstacle is when you do or say something that very, very lightly implies you may not accept her. The obstacle, however, must be something she feels like she can easily overcome. If she feels like the obstacle is too difficult (for example, if you tell her that she is too fat by 50 pounds) she will feel rejected and run off to find somebody else. Examples:

You: “You’re a Pisces? I’m an Aries. You know Aries and Pisces are not compatible, right?” 

You: “You’re only 23? I’m 34! You are way too young for me!”

No woman is going to run home and cry into their pillow because you said your signs don’t match or she is too young for you. Instead, it will motivate her to overcome the small obstacle to get you. And if a small obstacle doesn’t excite and motivate her to get you, she was not into you anyway.

Women sometimes shit test men by acting challenging to see if they can shift the frame from “her chasing you” to “you chasing her.” You must respond to this shit test by sending the message of “I like you, but I will not chase you.” For example, if a woman says “I don’t know if I should date you, you live too far away” most guys would react by saying shit like “No! 20 minutes is not that far! I will drive to come see you! I will pay for your Ubers! Pretty pretty please!” Instead, your response should be to agree and amplify “yeah, I do live too far away. In fact, my real house is on Mars, and it’s quite a commute.” By agreeing and amplifying, you turn the shit test around on her and make it again seem like you are the challenging one. 

If a woman has worked for your affection and her challenging statement is serious, you can acknowledge her contributions to the relationship. For example, if you have been dating a woman for a few weeks and she says “you live too far” your response should be “well, I like you, but that’s your decision.” Remember – you can reward a woman for her contributions, but you cannot chase her. 

Most guys know on some level that women like challenging guys, but they do not quite understand how to be challenging, so they end up acting douchey, weird, try-hard, and unnecessarily aloof. Nothing screams “I am a beta male” than randomly being an asshole to a woman if she has done nothing to deserve it. But even worse, unnecessarily being an asshole makes women feel rejected. A woman should feel like you are ignoring her or withdrawing your attention because you genuinely have better things to do, not because you are trying to hurt her or play games. 

You must also ensure the challenge has the right level of difficulty, like a good video game. If the challenge is too easy, she will get bored and look for a harder challenge. If the challenge is too difficult, she will give up and find a guy who is easier to get. You must constantly modulate the challenge to ensure she is engaged, having fun, but still has not “grasped” you. Being challenging is a feeling, and you must use your emotional intelligent to know when to turn the difficulty up or down. 

When I tell men and women to be challenging, they often sneer and say something like “I am too old to play games.” People that say this misunderstand that the human desire for a challenge is very deep and strong. They also fail to understand that there is a healthy and toxic way to be challenging in a relationship. In a healthy relationship, each party challenges the other party to become better and the parties make a preliminary commitment to each other with the condition that each side must do their part. Every man and woman must be challenging in relationships and any person who makes an unconditional commitment to another person is either lying, stupid, crazy, or all three. A person should be challenging not to “play games” but to make something clear that was true anyway – “you cannot be with me unless you meet certain standards.”

Unfortunately, most people do not understand the difference between a healthy and a toxic challenge, so they chase people who do not give a fuck about them and treat them like shit. Womens’ desire for a particularly challenge often causes them to chase substandard men just because they happened to act challenging at the right time. As we have learned, even if you are a desperate, pathetic, loser, it is easy to appear challenging by saying a few clever lines. The fact that women can so easily fall for this is actually pretty sad. 

So what happens if you blow it by looking needy and beta? Is it possible to recover and look challenging again? The answer is yes, but it takes a lot of work and is usually not worth it. When a woman subconsciously classifies you as a needy beta who is chasing her, it is hard to get her to reverse that classification. Once you get the stench of desperation on you, it is hard to wash off. Even worse, the main problem with trying to get a woman back after you became the beta in the relationship is that YOU feel like a beta vis-à-vis her and will naturally want to act beta around her. A man with true abundance will not even waste his time trying to accomplish this reset – he would just go find a different woman.

Nevertheless, for completeness I will tell you how to “recover” once you have failed to act challenging. Basically, you need to “teach” the woman that you are more focused on your purposes than her. You must send the following message: “I know it appeared for a second like I was more focused on you than my purposes, but that is actually not the case. My purposes are more important and you just misinterpreted my actions.” 

For example, if you approach a woman at a bar or nightclub and blow it by being needy and not being challenging, you can just leave, walk around, and do other stuff, like talking to other people (preferably, other women). You may even walk by her a few times and ignore her to teach her subconscious mind that you have “moved on.” Then, later in the night you can maybe come back and say “oh hey you again. How was the rest of your night”? That sometimes works. 

If you blew it over text by texting too much, it is harder to recover because it is almost impossible to show a woman you have “moved on” over text. The very act of texting her is proof that you are still thinking about her. Nevertheless, if you act too needy over text you can ignore her for a few weeks and then randomly text her something that has to do with your mission and is also interesting to her. 

If you are hooking up with woman and she says “no” to physical escalation (for example, if you try to put your hands down her pants), it is probably because you are coming on too strong. You can often recover by making a joke and then completely changing the subject to something fun or related to your purpose. I might even make a joke saying something like “I didn’t even want to kiss you” and then completely “move on.” If she feels like you have genuinely moved on (and she feels attracted to you), she will want to re-initiate.

49,Angry again,75,w1ta4c,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w1ta4c/angry_again/,80,"This is just a need to vent on my end.

I'm fucking done with women. Every single serious trauma that I had in life has come from women, including my mother, my sister, and women I loved. I worked through it all, I've grown so so much. I'm a very patient dude, I've tried, I've worked empathy, my anger had subsided, I never blow up, I always wait and resolve things peacefully, I always try to see all the possible points of view in any given situation that I can, I've gone through the ""way of love"" as they say, trying to work situations and problems out with the best in mind, hoping the best, treating people well even in times when they don't deserve it, giving second chances, trying to make the best come out of those around me, I've struggled alone through nights, puking my head onto paper to try to understand myself better, to be a better man. I've studied the red pill for years and I took a lot of good from it, I started studying stoicism and parts of Buddhism and it has opened my mind to much more and to ways to live better. My anger had subsided, I was cool again, a fool kind of a dreamer once more, but I felt good, life was nice and hey, guess what?

The last woman I got involved with ended up being fucked up in the head, for real, and she's a lying, cheating pile of shit who believes she's something else in this world while she should have been fucking grateful I even decided to talk to her in the first place, because after knowing her for a year, she's just fucking worthless, and she knows it deep down, that's why she's so damn miserable. Lies and lies and lies, omitting, minimizing, manipulating shit all the time, and then playing victim and taking zero responsibility for anything and putting it all on others. Just a good fuck, that's all she gets, the rest of her is useless.

All my friends and relatives women make their lives difficult too, all of them.

Then in other women I find constant double standards, they're like little girls, sluts that want to be treated like virgins and trash that wants to be treated like queens, justifying cheating for women but not for men, saying that forcing a child on a man ain't that bad but a man that leaves is a fucking asshole and so on, and most of these girls/women today have this retarded sense of entitlement they get out of nowhere, while they whine through phones built with hard to get metals mined by African boy kids and assembled by suicidal Asian men that aren't even allowed to kill themselves at work, while the 4g and 5g technologies invented mostly by men work because men tend to the fucking cell towers and lines and mine the fucking iron and work the fucking machines to create the steel to make the cables and machinery and computers (that require far more prime materials gotten by men) that will be moved by trucks and ships by far driven mostly by men, to be assembled by men to be maintained to be kept on running at all times by men who work their asses off for these good for nothing air-wasting fried-brain useless pieces of shit bitches to take a selfie with filters and post it to get some male attention to try to fill the void they have in their fucking soulless chests, and this is just one example!

Fuck!

What's the point? Yes, some of the most memorable, most happy moments in my life have been with women. Moments when everything else seems to cease to exist. It's you and her and those four walls and time and space vanish and her skin and her heartbeat and her eyes are everything and you want nothing more than that, you could die right then and there.

Yes, that's a thing, but at what cost? Why play this fucking unwinnable game that seems to forever make us miserable? Because if you dedicate to yourself and don't deal with women at all, the loneliness will kill you. If you just fuck plates and nothing else, eventually that will feel so empty, the emptiness will eat you up. And if you try to play the game of a LTR, the drama and the bullshit will sicken you.

There's no winning, is there? What's the fucking point? Why deal with them at all? Do I need to become this kind of Pimp-like semi psychopathic asshole with no empathy to be able to deal with them without getting hurt in the process? Because they seem to me just like porcupines now, and it seems to me only personalities like that get away with it.

Fuck this shit. Seriously. I know the anger will subside in some time and I'll be back to normal, or maybe not, who knows. But I'm done with this stupid game, I'm fucking done.",1658129328.0
50,"The paradox of female ""communication""",145,w1o9gk,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w1o9gk/the_paradox_of_female_communication/,27,"I assert that the greatest irony of all is the fact that women claim to be the paragon of ""good communication"". That's also on top of them always implying that they hold the highest virtue in relationships. It only takes a few short minutes on twoxchromosomes to see this play out. I think that both men and women are quite capable of thinking and behaving irrationally and emotionally, it's just that women are more insidious and manipulative about it.

1- the best example is the choice of words that women use when they argue. Eg: ""You NEVER help out with ANYTHING at home!"" It's obviously not true in the factual sense, but it's true in the emotional sense. She feels unappreciated, upset, anxious, or any other combination of emotions, and her choice of words are optimized to express her emotions in the moment as accurately as possible. Emotional accuracy trumps informational accuracy every single time. It doesn't matter that the words she chooses will cause unnecessary damage to the relationship, and is completely unfair to her partner. She needs to express her emotions, goddamit!

2- the second point is related to the above point: women are generally incapable of sorting out their emotions internally and independently. This is why you have BP guys being used as emotional tampons. They need to continuously flap their jaws until they get tired, and their exhaustion will somehow mean that the emotions are adequately ""processed"" . That is, until they feel anxious again, and the whole process repeats. This is also combined point no 1 above where they will be with a group of guy friends and will blurt out things like: ""Men are trash."" Again, this is coming from beings who are enlightened in the ways of communication and relationship virtue.

3- as if the two points above aren't annoying enough, there is another ironic factor in women's ""relationship skills"": they only do these things to the men in their lives that they trust. The reason for this is simply because despite being highly irrational, women are not stupid. They are in fact very well suited for survival. They know on an instinctual level that if they exhibit these behaviours to any random guy on the street, they will get maced in the face and might end up in the hospital or worse. Even with all the ""girl power"" screeching, they are smart enough to know that getting violent with a man is not a good idea. But she needs to express her emotions, goddamit! Therefore the best candidates are the men in her life that she trusts. Maybe they think we should see that as a compliment?

4- and that's not all folks! Yup it gets better. When you combine points no1 and no2, what you get is a creature with no sense of proportion. A creature who can't process their own emotions without the aid of external expression, and they won't accept any discounts in the expression of their emotions. This means that there is no way to get a word in once they are in this state of positive feedback loop. The only thing to do is to leave the scene and wait for the hamster wheel's energy to dissipate. This is the reason why older men always have to give in to their wives in arguments. ""Happy wife, happy life"" or so they say. Bollocks.

I'm sure you can deduce from the above that the closer you get to a woman, the more of this shit you'll have to deal with. From friend, FWB, boyfriend, fiance, husband, the shit just gets more and more intense. This is really what ""being her rock"" means. It's also why every time I hear a woman screech ""I don't need no man!"", it's so transparent to me it's hilarious. The only real solutions?

1- be happy on your own without needing companionship. admittedly this is very hard and few are able to attain it. In my experience, meditation helps. Notice also that it's always men who attain high levels of consciousness and end up renouncing the world. It's never ""the old woman on the mountain"" is it?

2- the Red Pill. Have relationships with women, but never properly commit. If they know you can leave anytime, they'll be forced to edit themselves in your presence and act out their anxieties with someone else, probably the BP in their orbit. Most people see this as too much work and I empathize. I think it is as well.

What you don't want to do is to try to achieve a middle ground 'purple pill'. It doesn't exist. If men and women are indeed similar, there would be no point in sexual reproduction. We should just be asexual and clone ourselves. The whole point of sex is differentiation. And with differentiation comes conflict, paradox, and irony. It is what it is.",1658111612.0
51,[FIELD REPORT] I pulled a girl while we were waiting for the elevator to the parking garage,79,w175qb,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w175qb/field_report_i_pulled_a_girl_while_we_were/,41,"**Stats:**

Age: 28

Race: Eastern Asian

Height: 5'7

Location: Las Vegas

**Preface:** I haven't been able to run game as much recently due to my FWBs. I met another local girl 3 weeks ago and now she's my 3rd FWB, which takes up alot of my free time. Initially, I didn't want to write this part because it just feels like a huge humble brag, but I think it's important because it's been 11 months since I started night game and it's drastically changed my dating life. Before this, I had no women in my life. Like it was the Sahara desert up in this bitch. But now, I got 3 FWBs and I'm still constantly hooking up with new girls. I've never had abundance like this before and I gotta say I'm pretty happy with where my life is at this moment.

For those curious, my FWBs are chinese, white, and half black/white. I just need a hispanic girl now lol.

**Set:**

I got off work and went straight to the club. It was LIT. I bumped into 3 wings there so that's always fun. Anyways so I opened probably 10-15 sets total while at the club. I made out with this fine ass black canadian girl but couldnt pull.

Anyways, so I see this girl in a purple dress (Let's call her ashley) who was dancing carelessly with her friends. I approach and open with cold reads. Ashley was hooked after like 2 cold reads. She started asking me questions and I just play guessing games with her. We chat for like maybe 5 minutes tops and then her friend pulls her away, but not to get away from me, more like to talk to her. The friend had something urgent to tell her I guess. I was like ok whatever, I'm leaving so I just bounce. I go on to run a few more sets but nothing sticks. It's 3am so I'm like ok time to go home, I'm seeing one of my girls the next day anyways.

I walk out of the club and through the casino to the garage elevators. Once I get to the elevator lobby, I see Ashley there with all her friends so I reapproach to get her number since I didnt get a chance earlier. I opened with something like ""wow, we finally meet again, it must be destiny"". Her eyes widen and she smiles. Obviously glad to see me again. I make an observation cold read regarding the situation since one of her friends was throwing up. I make minor jokes about it. Then I go into logistics. Basically I'm trying to assess the situation. She says that they're gonna go home but I object and say nah lets go to the after party. I tell her we can get drinks there. She says she's done drinking but she'll smoke weed. Now, I don't have weed but there are 24 hour dispensaries in vegas so not a problem. I said, yeah let's pick up some weed even though I dont smoke. She says bye to her friends and then we head to my car. Picked up some weed, went back to my place, and yall know how it goes ;)

**Key takeaways:**

1. Don't be afraid to reapproach: Just because the initial approach didn't ""work"" doesn't mean the reapproach wont. This isn't my first reapproach success and it wont be my last. 
2. You gotta have some logic when running game: I reapproached Ashley in the elevator lobby so I knew this was gonna be a time sensitive set. She's in a destination where she most likely has to leave very soon. I basically knew I need to speed run this set. I quickly built a little bit of rapport before going straight into logistics. After assessing logistics, I asked for the pull and then solved further logistics such as not having weed.
3. ASK FOR THE PULL: so many guys in this situation would just ask for a number close and call it a night. Fuckkkkk that. Initially, I wanted to invite her and all her friends to the ""after party"" aka hang at my place. There's no fucking after party but I'll cross that bridge IF it happens lmao. Luckily, she was willing to self isolate and come with me. But regardless, if you cant pull the girl by herself, then pull the whole set. There's a 0% chance of me hooking up with her at the elevator lobby but there might be a 2% chance even if I bring 4 girls to my place.",1658063628.0
52,"Looks, or money?",37,w0yibj,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w0yibj/looks_or_money/,95,"I don't know what it is, but somehow I was drawing girl after girl after girl who never ever wanted children. 

I'm an ethnic so I don't know maybe the redacted supremacists are correct and people should be with their own kind. Not that I was opposed to my own ethnic group...they just weren't into me. 

I'm at a point now where I've made a ton of bucks during the pandemic: business took the fuck out off, saved up. Ton of educational debt though. 

I have literally no threshold of attractiveness or anything. They just must be someone who wants to have a child, which in this sick sterile society is apparently like finding a needle in a haystack.

Whatever, so I have spent the pandemic grinding workwise, and in the process put on a bunch of weight

Yeah wouldn't it be great if I could both stay in shape and make a bunch of money thanksimcured. I bow down to the ubermenschen who can do both, but I'm not one of them. 

So it's one or the other. Money, or looks. 

Which one should I/anyone do?

I've gotten plenty of girls before, but only when in shape ..and almost uniformly ones who didn't want children for whatever reason.

I'm ready to take any ludicrous measure necessary: stop working to focus completely on fitness; leaving the country; becoming poor (I hear they have more kids); becoming homeless (I hear they have more kids), whatever it fucking takes.

53,Brown Guys Need To Emphasize the Physical Connection As The Foundation Of Their Relationships,64,vzz0nl,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vzz0nl/brown_guys_need_to_emphasize_the_physical/,81,"I mainly wrote this post for the South Asian guys in this sub however anyone else can learn from it as well especially if they also come from a more conservative culture

Does anyone else notice that Desis (the men in particular) only emphasize connecting with their romantic partners in the form of traditional values and things like religious/educational affiliations? Or even secondarily they might even focus on mental/emotional connection?

There seems to be a complete disregard for the Physical Connection aspect of things.

**This is basically shooting yourself in the foot**

It makes the dating process difficult and basically narrows down your potential pool of partners because now you're only dating girls that come from a certain ""religion"" or ""educational background"". It also subtly sends a signal to all Non-Desis that you only like a ""certain"" type of girl. This makes it so that even if a Non-Desi girl is attracted to you, she will still have preconceived notions about what your ""type"" is and if she doesn't fit that mold then she will just avoid you and won't even really tell you that she's into you.

Furthermore it also creates this whole thing where South Asian men are expected to be career driven, extra responsible/family oriented e.t.c. This might be cool if you're older and looking for a wife, but when you're young and just wanna date around? Stuff like this makes you lose points because women usually only wanna do all that freaky shit with guys they see as ""temporary"".

**This creates a lot of misconceptions**

For example this is why a lot of Desis are so immersed in the idea that their career/money is important. It's because in our community if you're not doing great in your career then you're a complete loser. This makes guys have the misconception that Desi men have to ""betabuxx"". You don't have to betabuxx for shit. The main reason women use guys (of any race) for money is because these guys usually somehow brag to them about how much money they have or that they have some good career and now the woman knows that she can get money out of him by stroking his ego. That's how those dudes end up going on expensive dates and having stupid ""intellectual discussions"" and then end up going home and jerking off. Instead if this dude just talked about stuff other than his career, and instead of talking about money if he just wore a nice pair of shoes that compliments the rest of his outfit then he would be golden.

**Why is it FAR better to pursue a Physical Connection than an Emotional/Mental/Any Other Connection**

Simple. Because it's easy as fuck. To make a **Physical connection**, you just need to find the other person attractive and vice versa and satisfy each others physical needs (Which women have far more than you think). Furthermore just focusing on this aspect makes you seem more exciting and thrilling which makes the woman want you even more.

**Intellectual connection**? Bruh you both need to be well versed in World Issues and shit, and God forbid you have a different opinion from her on any topic because of your life experiences. If this happens too much she will automatically think you're ignorant.

**Religious connection**? Self explanatory unless you're a pastor who's tryna get with some deluded overly religious woman who thinks you're God in human form or something.

**Emotional/Romantic connection?** Now you need to fit into the laundry list of personalized standards in her head that's based on some movie or social media trend/posts that she May or May Not tell you, and if you make a mistake now you're ""not being a good partner"",""I don't like how you're making me feel"".

Also the more ""religious/conservative"" your culture is, if you approach women from a similar culture they will automatically try to make you wait for sex and try to shame you when you try to escalate. When these same women come across a guy from a sex positive culture they won't say anything negative and they'll suck the soul out of his dick because they know that his culture prioritizes the sexual connection so they won't really expect him to fulfil her intellectual/spiritual needs. Instead for those needs she will go to the ""conservative"" guy and then he's gonna be sexually frustrated by her and they're just gonna go on endless sexless dates and he's gonna go whine on the internet.

**This actually negatively impacts men's mental health more**

I've scoured through reddit and seen quite a few posts by South Asian guys talking about how they're upset at their lack of dating success, and then somewhere in the post they'll mention how they only want a University educated woman or some ""conservative girl"" or some girl who ""doesn't participate in hookup culture"". Like bro are you living in 2022 or what?? I can already tell that when these guys go on dates they probably try to talk about some stupid book or intellectual topic, and the girl will be interested for a bit but then get bored as fuck later on. And since these dudes don't really sexually escalate they fail to give a woman the ""tingles"" too. They're the type to go on like 3 dates without even kissing a girl.

The end result for these guys is that the best case scenario for them is going on like 4-5 dates or more with different girls and then talking about bs and then things fizzle out because there was ""no connection"". Then they get depressed and blame it on their race. I personally know I can create a connection with a good amount of girls even though I'm not similar to them in any way just by focusing on the physical aspect.

If anyone has seen the movie ""**Idiocracy**"" it is similar to that scene where all the ""intellectual"" type of people basically breed themselves out by not really having sex, and all the ""lower intelligence"" people conquer the world. No offence to anyone though.

**Food for thought:**

How many times have you stopped talking to/pursuing a girl because you realized that the relationship was going nowhere or because of some dumb cultural reason?

Think about your current/past relationships and what were the foundations of those relationships? Were you mostly emphasizing money? Romantic gestures? Adherence to a Religion? Following some political ideology together? Knowing this can help you realize where things went wrong and which aspects of the connection are better to focus on in future relationships.",1657918749.0
54,Biological Factors Affecting the Dating Marketplace,140,vxg7bi,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vxg7bi/biological_factors_affecting_the_dating/,35,"A lot of newbies face similar mistakes with women, and while experience is the best teacher, sometimes having a macro, big picture understanding of the sexual marketplace can help. After you’ve spun plates, lifted weights, you may still encounter problems with women.

The catchall solution is always ‘dread and lift. The issue is that men are naturally linear - one issue, one solution at one time. So when the previous chick issue is solved (ex: LTR learns to behave, found a new plate, IOIs at the coffee shop, etc) we return to neutral or go overboard. And eventually either the issue repeats or a new issue arises.

To give context we need to understand that women are more manipulative than men. This is from generations of natural selection - men are stronger, and for them to survive in primate societies that solved issues with violence, they need to use their heads. Either through securing strong offsprings from the alpha, or using sex as a transaction to exchange protection from a beta. Maintaining a ‘clean’ image is essential so they won’t be outcasted. Seeing as there are always more betas in a society, and a group of angry betas can be dangerous, so women learn to manage betas. These skills are passed down. Therefore the modern women, like the primate women, have MULTIPLE things on their mind when dating. 

1. Sex: Is he hot? She wants the best offspring, and will screen for good genetic material
2. Emotional draw: Does she get ‘tingles’ from him? Famous? Dangerous? The high and lows.
3. Security: Can he provide? Will it be spent on her? Can he get more when it’s out?
4. Reliability: Does he make her feel better when she cries? Is the frame solid? Good daddy? Is she at ease?
5. Trust: Will he leave when she hits the wall? Will she be left alone? Abandonment possible?

As a guy, it isn’t easy deciphering a women’s intention when she gives him shit. Is it a shit test? Is it a comfort test? It’s even harder when you’re in constant contact due to living with a chick, hence why LTR is TRP on hard mode. Once a women catches onto your pattern of behavior, she’ll start going down the list of what you’re lacking and poke at them.

We need to understand that women at different stages of the lives prioritise different things. The 21 year old will want sex, and emotional thrill. The transactional cost is she will do whatever the guy wants and risk heartbreak or hitting the wall alone. The post-wall women will be willing to sacrifice fun for someone that won’t leave her and can provide. The transactional cost will be she gives the unattractive beta sex. Everything is fluid as women are emotional so her needs today will not be the same as her needs tomorrow.

The solution some might think is to apply different approaches in different situations. Understand context and reply appropriately. ‘But what about AWALT?’ 

AWALT is what prevents us from becoming disproportionate female pleasers. It’s a trap to seek the perfect answers because that means we are in their frame. Do we give security because she wants it? Do we give sex because she wants it? If she wants a more intense sexual experience do we create it? AWALT - whatever you do, she can branch swing. 

So, the answer circles back to whoever reads this. It’s what YOU want. If you want young bodies you should SKEW your sexual strategy to seek out thrill seeking women. If you want a mother for your kids, you should TILT your strategy to attract someone who hates going out for a ONS. 

So instead of going through the ups and downs of dating, really think about the type of women you want to attract. If you’re building a home on shitty soil, it won’t be sturdy. AKA: don’t make a hoe a housewife. If you want fun women, don’t always be available - she wants the fuckboy she can throw away who isn’t holding her back from finding a better guy at the sexual marketplace. If you’re Johnny Depp focus on frame. If you aren’t Johnny Depp, become Johnny Depp (perceived desirable alpha). 

TL;DR: Remember dating and sex is meant to be fun, so enjoy never ending road to becoming an ironclad alpha. Women have many things on their mind - understand it but do not revolve your life around it.",1657645577.0

I read those words in another post here, and it just so perfectly summarizes what I have learned through my 27 years of living. I started to make this a reply, but it developed into more of a post in length. 

If you want to obtain the things you truly want in life, you HAVE to internalize this statement. You HAVE to realize that things won’t just magically get better down the road. When I was younger, I had a bad habit of having this fantasy that things would just magically fall into place in the future. That I would somehow become more confident and more successful. Somehow, it would just happen. As with a lot of our thoughts, writing it out on “paper” makes me realize how foolish that was of me to think. 

The thing is, those things we dream about will never happen if we don’t live in the present and start putting in the work TODAY. And no one can do that except for you. The  “lucky breaks” that we see others get are very often the result of internalized self-belief and confidence. Those things can only truly be internalized through putting the work in day in and day out, until you KNOW that you can go the distance. 

I honestly believe that once you have acquired the skill set, and more importantly mindset, to get one “lucky break”, you can repeat that over and over. That’s why things seem to snowball for people after they have that first taste of success. In other words, they aren’t really lucky breaks, but the result of the internal state of mind you’ve cultivated. Look at the people who seem to be truly confident. Notice how they seem to get the best results time and time again. And when they do come up short, it doesn’t cause them to go into a tailspin. 

To the above point, one more thing to add: I’ve also been guilty of trying to change my whole life in a day. I’m sure a lot of us have been there over the course of our journeys. We get a surge of motivation, and try to implement all of these great habits at once. After a few weeks, or even months, our motivation inevitably wanes. Instead of trying to dial back what we’re doing, we get discouraged and drop everything altogether.

So don’t worry about figuring everything out at once. For most of us, life is long. We have YEARS to figure this shit out. That is one good thing about being a man, we tend to gain value as we age, as opposed to losing it like women. Start small: a healthy meal here, a quick workout of compound movements there. Try talking to someone new once a week. So on and so forth. 

No matter what anyone says, the population of men (or people in general) willing to do what is hard to achieve what they desire is getting smaller and smaller. Life is precious y’all. Get out there and make the most of it.",1657201061.0

I see that in the posts that get upvotes and the questions that get asked.

The way common fucking sense is challenged.

Some of you guys reading this are very much asleep.

There are some who are starting to see the reality and are way too fucking angry.

Some anger is OK. After all, you were sold a lie. 

You were told that you can be yourself and you'll find a woman who will love you. You were told that women are equal to men but should be protected. You were told that out there among all the loose women there was a vestal virgin who will be your own personal maid, sex worker, lover, chef, friend, mother to your kids and she'll stay with you forever.

Because you are special.

Pick up any book, movie, anime, comic, fable, etc.

Look at the ideal woman and relationship and realize that that is a fantasy.

She's not going to wait for you when you go away overseas. She's not a virgin who saved herself for you. She's not to stay with you forever. She's not your best friend, a replacement for your mother and your own personal whore all in one.

How can she be?

Not only is that shit one hell of a task but it's also fraught with challenges from her environment, the dogma taught to her and the family and friends she keeps.

So, wake up.

I say this time and time again because it's true. There's not much aside from minor nuances that any vet can say that hasn't been posted and immortalized in the side bar.

So why so many of you can't be bothered isn't because of her or feminism but because you're too fucking lazy to be bothered.

You're too fucking lazy to pick up weights and get stronger because it's hard.

You're too fucking scared to approach a stranger because it's new.

You're too fucking stupid to realize that no one here can change your life but you.

Life is hard, scary and risky. If all you do is read theory than you'll never do anything.

You've just discovered a new way to cope with failure.

You want shit. That requires work to attain. Nature doesn't give a fuck about how you feel.

Ground your expectations with reality and calculate what you can sacrifice for what you want.

Finally, go out there and try shit.

Take risks and put effort into yourself.

If we can all pool our experiences and create a fucking guide to getting the girl(s), making bank money and living the life but you can't be bothered to open the fucking book because you'd rather debate and it requires you to go outside and do shit...

Why should you deserve anything other than misery and frustration?

57,The story of Michael,191,vr2fk2,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vr2fk2/the_story_of_michael/,102,"[This](https://dalrock.wordpress.com/2012/11/24/more-grim-news-for-carousellers-hoping-to-jump-at-the-last-minute/#comment-62160) is a comment from 2012 on Dalrock's site. A story of what happens to the average, BP, high-income geeky guy, whose imaginary world slowly starts to crumble as he goes through college.

&#x200B;

Hello. Is there an introduction board for this website? My name is Michael. I’ve been reading this website for 3 days. I’m shocked to see everything I’ve experiencing written in such a perfectly stated way. Never before have I seen a blog/media outlet so perfectly written. The writer is surely a genius. I’m amazed and relived to see so many responses. It means I’m not alone.

I’m 32 years old and have never been married. Unfortunately (or fortunately I’m not sure which anymore at this point) I have no kids. I am single and alone and not dating anyone. I live in Los Angeles. My income was $120,000.00 (net earnings after creative deductions and business taxes) in 2011. Income is projected to be $170,000.00 (net earnings after business taxes) in 2012. I’m exactly the kinds of “independent man” women claim they want. I drive a luxury car with an amazing apartment in Los Angeles directly on the beach. It’s quite a panty moistener and costs me $6,000.00 per month. I work from home because an office would cost at least another $2,000.00 month. I keep in great shape. Gym 3-4 a week + running + organic diet (I spend $700-$900.00 a month on organic foods and supplements) I was raised in a Christian “7th Heaven” (old TV show) type household. We always went to church. Strong hard working father figure was always present for me and my siblings. I went to private school, university, law school, and then started my own practice at 28 years old.

My parents met and married in college. They have been married for 39 years. And it hurts me to the core to be 32 and unmarried. Alone. Without a loving wife. I feel pain from it every single day. It’s like a sharp invisible dagger constantly stabbing at me. But perhaps I’m part of the problem listed in the graphs above. Let me explain why:

I went to the same college my parents met and married at. I was hoping to meet marry and settle down. Instead I was met with hundreds young college aged women who were NOT interested in marriage. They were interested in: 1) Partying 2) Having sex. College was 24/7 fuck fest. At first I was able to begrudgingly “socialize” in this element. What do I mean by “this element” within this context? College: Extreme social promiscuity, cheating, drama, drugs, and parties. I was an observer but NEVER a direct participant because my heart would not let me. This eventually caused me to stick out as a third wheel observer on campus. Someone who was always “not mixing” or “participating”. As a result I never enjoyed the benefits. I rarely dated. Instead I was sneered at. Cute girls flicked their fingers at me. I was used by women as a person to tell their problems to. I was passed over. I was seen as “weak “lame” and “boring”. I was ignored in the hallways, library, classes, by these women. And it didn’t help I was cash strapped broke working a minimum wage job and eating Raman noodles..

The vast majority of these young hot girls vigorously pursued college life sex like you would not believe. They had sex with a large variety of guys. What I personally call “lily padding”. These girls did anything and anyone in the name of “fun” (fun=parties, fun= sex with new people, fun= drugs, fun= raves, fun = frat party etc.

It hurt me to watch these girls go out of their way to pursue and spread their legs for complete losers. COMPLETE LOSERS. I’m talking: Hi I work in a carnival part time, I’m covered in tattoos, I have no job, I failed my minimum wage drug test and I’m in a band. These guys were losers. Some did not even go to the college! They would hop a bus stay with friends and get laid THAT NIGHT.

Many nights I could not sleep because of the girls getting fucked hard… 1,2,3,4 dorms down. The dorms were old military barracks from the 1940’s with vents through the ceilings. It was very loud. All the time. I remember how much it hurt to be rejected by one girl in particular I had my open hopeless romantic heart set on… We had allot in common. I pursued her like a complete gentlemen – and was eventually turned down. That same weekend after getting turned down I got to hear her getting fucked hard and loud in the room next door. The guy who lived there was a super scraggly unattractive heavy drug user covered in tattoos majoring in “music studies”. This girl was young hot thin beautiful in her physical prime. I never said anything. But I felt so hurt she turned me down for casual sex with a guy like that.This guy was very open about his exploits with her and told me not to worry because practically every guy he knew fucked her. As the years passed the same thing happened again and again, and again and again, in various ways with all kinds of unrelated girls. What I mean is: I was looking for a LTR leading to marriage. I would meet trade numbers talk and “feel” a girl was a good person. Then she would do other guys. Or I would find out things like this. When this kind of thing happens to me over and over all through my life….it hurts me and makes me doubt senses. What is wrong with me that my heart is telling me she is a good person when she is clearly not?

As time went on I was labeled “husband material” by the girls on my campus. This phrase continued to plague me into my late 20’s. This label resulted in ZERO DATES all through college. I wasn’t “down with it”. I wasn’t “participating” etc (sex, drugs, parties, etc.) My heart wasn’t into it. So I wasn’t entitled to any of the benefits (having sex with young attractive girls in their prime etc.). However party guys, flash in a pan athletes, loser guys in bands, wanna be DJ’s and self-professed “club promoters” – were ALWAYS getting these girls at their youngest hottest physical prime. Basically the more of a loser the guy was… the more these women would have sex with them. Hot sorority girls flocked to Football players like a butterfly’s on a beast. It didn’t even matter if the guy was black. College athletes did not even TRY to get laid.

One night I had enough. I confronted a room of 8-10 gorgeous white girls. These girls were 18-24 years old. I asked them if they planned to get married. All seemed to say more or less – YES. I asked what their future husband would think about their behavior. I was immediately met with hostility. I was told the future husband would “never know” and “it’s none of his business”. The girls said they knew exactly what they were doing and were planning to “have their fun” (fun= partying, fun=sex, fun=going on spring break etc.) and would “settle down later”. I asked: when are you planning to settle down? They said: “It depends” and “probably around 27, 28” or “maybe sooner it depends”. I really put the girls on the spot. During our exchange they saw I was upset. They told me I should be happy because “nice guys finish first in the end”. I told them you cannot have your cake and eat it to. Then I was told by Kaylene (a young thin super sexy blonde with curves in all the right places (who BTW refused to date me even though we were friends and according to her roommate had sex with almost 30 guys in one semester ) she told me “Michael let me tell you something: not only am I going to have my cake eat it and eat it too. I’m going to have it with ice cream and sprinkles”. All of the girls laughed and smiled in agreement.

I thought things would change after college. They didn’t.

Now at 32 and successful these women are hitting me. In my mind these are the same women who rejected me. I’m not interested. The Bible says something to the effect of “don’t forsake the wife of your youth” or something like “remember your young wife”? Something like that. How am I supposed to remember something I never had? I have no history with these women. Ticking ovaries are scandalous. They will lie and say anything to get what they want. Which is: BABIES AND A LOVING HUSBAND TO PAY THEIR BILLS. Yet these women did not even give a few good years of their youth!

As a man I am very visual. God made me this way. I cannot help finding a physically beautiful woman attractive. Why did these women not at least give me a few years of their youth so I would have time to fall in love with them and permanently burn their image in my mind’s eye? I need something to remember when we are 50 and married. Yet she spent her 20’s parceling herself out to guys who gave her nothing and offers nothing to the guy who gives her everything. I’m expected to commit hard earned resources to raising children with what is ultimately a suspect woman whose history I know nothing about. A 30+ unmarried women has very high chance of having a questionable past and baggage. I believe the more men a woman has been with the less likely she is to be emotionally committed each subsequent one. When you have handed out little pieces of your heart over years to dozens of different men what is left for the husband you proclaim to truly love? What value do the words “I love you” mean when she has stared into the eyes of 10-100+ different men and said the same thing?

At 30+ women’s physical appearance has nowhere to go but DOWN. Is this what women mean by “saving the best for last”? Marrying at 30+? How can women spend trillions of dollars a year on beauty products yet at the same time claim a women’s age “shouldn’t be important” to a man? And what about children? Did they ever think their husbands might want to have children? What’s more likely to naturally produce a quicker pregnancy and healthy offspring? A fertile 24 year old in her physical prime… or a 35 year old aging womb? What if I want multiple children? At 30+ a women can easily before infertile after her first pregnancy.As a result of everything I’ve seen and experienced in my life I would like to make an announcement to all the desperate 30+ year old women out there: I would rather suffocate and die then spend my hard earned income, love, trust, and substance on you. Your entitled, ageing, feminist, jaded, baggage laden and brainwashed. And if I cannot marry a women in her 20’s I REFUSE TO EVER GET MARRIED. Given my high income this should not be a problem. However I’m concerned at some point I will have to start looking overseas (Ukraine, Russia, Eastern Europe etc.). I’m not going to marry one of these 30+ ageing entitled females who clearly have an agenda of their own. I intend to get married once. Marriage is meant to be forever. I will not be a starter husband for one of these used up women. I can’t tell you the number of men I’ve known who married late and were rewarded by losing everything they spent their lives building…

58,Are you making her orgasm ?,201,vqt3bs,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vqt3bs/are_you_making_her_orgasm/,43,"Do you know how to make a woman orgasm? Do you know how to use your hands? Mouth? Dick? Combination of these things? What is squirting? Are there different types of squiring? Do you know when a woman fakes an orgasm? Are you sure? Are there different types of orgasm?

I see a lot of information about self-improvement and dating strategy but I found almost nothing on this topic here. To use a 'dog chasing a car' analogy... TRP can teach you to how to catch the car but very little about how to drive a car once you catch it. Thus, I thought I'll make a post.

***TL;DR*** ***Touch her clitoris with your hand (specifically your three/four fingers - no thumb) while you are fucking her. Thats pretty much the gist of it. Find sex positions that allow you to touch her clitoris with your hand while you fuck her (eg. her back is on your chest). Most women are different and thus you will need to make the necessary adjustment's regarding hand movement(eg. circular, side to side, etc ), speed (some women like it super fast/medium/slow), pressure (eg light/medium/hard) and if you should or shouldn't include the clitoral hood as protection between your hands and clit. Hand movement might need to be different at the start than at the end.*** [this](https://www.xvideos.com/video28088891/orgasm_compilation) ***is how it looks like. THIS TIP IS THE MOST SIMPLE AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE (IMO). TADAAA this is how most women actually orgasm during sex. Read on if interested.***

*Disclaimer: I am by no means an 'expert' on this topic (who would really be an expert and how would you verify/measure that I do not know). I will admit that I have likely MUCH more to learn. However, I've been with my fair share of women. My guess would be that I slept with 80+ women. I had multiple long term relationships, fwb, multiple fwb at the same time, threesomes and one poly relationship. Nevertheless, if you think you can educate me/correct me and improve my knowledge on this topic, I sincerely and humbly invite you to do so in the comments.*

*Warning: This topic is quite complex and thus it's very difficult to summarise it into one post. I will forget things. I will organise things inefficiently... I will make mistakes. Sex is more like alchemy than chemistry and thus its hard to create a play-by-play..*

# 1. Intro

*Why make this post? Women don't orgasm with most men. Do not be one of those men!*

I like to be open about sex in my relationships. What do I mean by this? I mean.. I like to talk about everything with a woman regarding sex. Specifically, I like when women do majority of the talking. I want them to talk about fantasies, kinks, previous relationships. everything. Moreover, I like to talk about this topic without any judgement. I've been told multiple times that I am very easy to talk to about this stuff and that I do NOT put pressure on them to be a certain way sexually/shame them.

I've been told by women that they had gang bangs, they were raped/molested, had sex with a 'semi-close' relative (just to name a few rare unsavoury ones). However, one of the things I hear a lot about is the lack of orgasms that women experience. This ranges from women who never had an orgasm (and don't really masturbate), women who masturbate and don't orgasm, women who never orgasmed during sex (or are not sure), women who orgasmed during sex only a handful of times, and women who only make themselves orgasm during sex using their own hand ( I dont count grinding clit into abs to orgasm into this category) .

I would say 70+ percent of women I met fall into this category and ALMOST ALL of them told me that they faked it and lied about it to their lovers. I've been told a LOT of times that they simply fake it and that their lovers never really ask about it. I would say half of these women told me they never really had a conversation about sex with their boyfriends/lovers. I've been told a lot that if they don't fake it their lover just gets either disappointed or angry. Many times leading to a break up (e.g ""I made women orgasm before.. If I cant make you orgasm, it must mean we are just not compatible sexually""). Their explanation is that it's far easier to just fake it. This tells me that there are a lot of women who do not orgasm during sex. Just go on google scholar and type ""women"",""report"" and ""orgasm"" if you want the science. It seems that my anecdotal experience is in line with scientific findings.

# 2. Short overview of female anatomy and types of orgasms

To preface this, there is a lot o debate about different types of orgasms and about female anatomy (relating to orgasm context). For example, there is a debate if vaginal and clitoral orgasms are different. Another one is the existence of a g-spot .

**Anatomy:** I will not be describing the whole female anatomy and will focus on the most important parts. You can find an image of both on the websites linked.

[*Clitoris*](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326403#what-is-it)

[*G-spot*](https://thevelvetbox.com/health-wellness/the-g-spot/)

Anatomy discussion: There are many parts of the vagina + surrounding areas that can be pleasurable and thus orgasm inducing. Such as inter thighs, labia, taint, anus and many more. However, these will not be discussed in this short overview. Clitoris and g spot are the main focus here.

Is g spot connected to clitoris? Do your own research to decide. IMO, yes. Clitoris is a much larger structure than a small little clitoris head (tho majority of nerves are there). It's parts connect inward into the vagina and this is what we call a g spot. Define them how you want, however, these two area are generally considered the pleasure areas of female anatomy.

**Types of orgasm:** There is a debate in this area too, however, I'll divide them into 3 categories

*Clitoris orgasm* \- It is an orgasm that is achieved through clitoral stimulation

*Vaginal* \- Orgasm achieved through vaginal stimulation

*Other* \- Orgasm achieved through other parts of the body. Kissing, nipples, ass, anus, anal etc. This type of orgasm is fucking useless to focus on in this post imo. Apart from anal... this type of orgasm is extremely rare. Thus, it will not be discussed here any further.

Orgasm discussion: IMO most orgasms involve some part of the clitoris. It's either the clitoral head, outerior parts of the clitoris (e.g labia) and interior (g spot).

# 3. Orgasm

In my opinion, female ability to orgasm is the result of physical and emotional sexual stimulation, her anatomy and her past experience. You cannot influence her anatomy (you can adjust accordingly however) or pervious sexual experiences, and thus I will focus on physical and emotional stimulation. The hardest part of a non orgasmic woman is the first orgasm. Why? Well, did you cum the first time you jerked off? Or was it a gradual process until you figured it out? If a woman did not experience an orgasm during sex, she might be ready to have one. You might not know what to do. Might be too early into a relationship. You might not be attractive enough.

# 4. Barriers to female orgasm

**A. Her fault**

* She might not be psychologically ready
   * anxiety
   * cant relax
   * cant let go/submit
* She doesn't know how to give herself one
   * Is too afraid/ashamed to use her hand
   * Doesn't know how to move to make herself orgasm
   * Doesn't know how to grind her clitoris into your body so she can orgasm (this is typically cowgirl position)
* Her biology/hormones are fucked up
   * she truly might not be able to orgasm for what ever reason
   * If she cant make herself orgasm at all... good luck to you..

**B. Your fault**

* You have no idea what you are doing
* You aren't physically attractive enough
* You have severe physical deficiencies
* You can't create the right mood/ are awkward

# 5. Things that help with making women orgasm

BODY

* Penis - Girth/Length/Curve.
   * In my opinion, a larger penis (particularly thicker) has a positive effect on women having an orgasm. Larger penis fills up the vagina better and during insertion it can stimulate different outer parts of the vagina (thicker penis touches the sides of the vagina opening more and this is ""moving"" the whole vagina more). Curvature and angling can help with stimulating the g-spot.
   * If you have a smaller dick, angling and movement are your friends.
* Hot body - Muscles/Smell/Face
   * This is simple. You orgasm faster with a hotter woman. Women are the same. The most I had to control myself (not cum) is with a mixed Brazilian woman with 10/10 body. For those guys reading this who went from fat/twig body to jacked body, compare how women responded to you during sex before and after you got jacked. HIT THE GYM
   * Better face you have, more turned on she is. Testosterone and lower body fat% improves your face. HIT THE GYM
   * You having a masculine smell (or smell that turns her on) will make her more turned on.
* Rhythm
   * Do you suck at dancing? Do you move like an autist that cant even clap his hands in a rhythm? Well... this might be fucking up your sex life. Keeping a solid rhythm is key when you use your hand, mouth and dick. Think about it... When you jerk off, do you randomly change speed and rhythm? Try it. See if it makes you orgasm when you are close to cumming.
* Movement of your body/penis
   * How do you fuck ? Do you only jackhammer like a retard (not saying that there isn't a time and a place for this too tho). Or do you tease? Do you insert your penis only 1/3 in, 2/3 in, 3/3 sometimes? Do you know how to create a build up?
   * Do you know how to grind your lower abs into her clit during missionary ?

MIND

* Anticipation / before foreplay
   * Are you sexual? Are you touching her and making your intentions known?
   * Teasing her
   * What do you do before you become sexual?
   * Do you talk dirty to her ) ?
* Mood
   * Are YOU relaxed?
   * Do you know how to take charge?
   * Can you smoothly move it to sex or are you awkward?
* Foreplay
   * Is your foreplay long enough? (quickie excluded)
   * Are you sufficiently teasing her?
* Sex
   * Are you dominant?
   * Do you talk dirty to her ?
   * Do you use your hands to touch her during sex? Her ass, waist, neck, etc?
   * Are you physical? Pick her up? Fucking her with enthusiasm and passion?

# Actual things that you can do

Keep in mind you need to learn her body. Women are like golf. You need to play each hole little bit differently. However, if you played golf before, you have an idea what to do on different courses.

* Oral
   * A good foreplay built up can do wonders with oral
   * Focus the clit: The clit is where the action is at. You should take care of other vagina parts but the clitoris is the main focus.
   * To be or not to be? To insert your fingers or not? In my experience most women enjoy inserting two fingers inside the vagina to rub the g spot while you do oral. Google how to massage the g spot.
   * Put your whole mouth (lips) on the clitoris. Don't do the porn lick.
   * How to move your tongue? Well, this again depends on a lady. In my experience you typically go around the clitoris with your tongue, side to side, bottom to top or just a kissing motion.
   * What suction pressure to use? Well this again depends on a lady. Some women (ime) like a LOT of suction while some almost none. Moreover, you might need to increase suction gradually.
   * MY best move is to suck the clit like a little dick (yeah thats what the clit is) and do a gentle come here motion on her g spot with my middle and ring finger)
   * There are many more methods that work on some women (e.g tongue going inside vag)
   * Dont be afraid to lick pussy when she is in doggy style position (you lick her from the back). I had women who could only cum that way
* Hands
   * Come here motion with two fingers when stimulating the g spot as previously mentioned in oral section. (only this time you can be kissing her/ kissing her tits etc)
   * Google how to make a woman squirt with hands. You basically make the same motion as above just faster, shakier and stronger.
   * Clitoris: this depends which way are you facing her clit
      * Palm on her stomach fingers on clit ->> Best way to use hands imo. It's the one from TLDR. Why is it the best? It's the angle of hand she uses to masturbate. Thus, this is the one she is the most prepared for.
      * The opposite way ->> I typically use my thumb
   * Massage her anus opening. Only the opening at first (if you do anal play)

Ok I m done. I might edit (or add) some things later on but this is a decent introduction into the topic. It took me 4.5 hours to write this, which for me is roughly 200 euros wasted. Hope it wasn't a total waste.

Edit: I am not saying you need to do a lot of this stuff. When my girlfriend wakes me up in the middle of the night to fuck, I don't do anything other than put saliva on my hand, insert my dick and fuck. I dont talk dirty, there was no foreplay/built up.. I just move my body how I know she likes it. She cums. I go back to sleep (sometimes I don't even cum). This isn't some instruction manual. I don't really think about this stuff when I have sex. It comes naturally. It's like jerking off. You just know what you are doing after a while. However, making her orgasm for the first time is the real hurdle to get over. Here all the extras can be quite helpful.",1656888335.0
59,I thought you all might enjoy this old experience,306,vqkk01,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vqkk01/i_thought_you_all_might_enjoy_this_old_experience/,60,"So let me start by saying I have two friends in this story. Good looking friend ""Jon"" and average looking friend ""Ron"". Jon was always wanted by every girl growing up. He could fart loudly and still get a girls number without trying. Ron was like most of us he won some and lost some. There was a girl I had as a friend named ""Kelsie"" growing up. I never saw her in a romantic way but she was about average attraction wise. So Ron met her and developed a huge crush. She gave him her number and he ended up texting her at night after work. Ron said nothing weird or sexual. Kelsie later comes to me and says she regrets giving her number out and that Ron gives her creepy vibes. I saw the texts from both phones and there was nothing wrong.

Fast forward Kelsie had developed a major crush on Jon like all other women who have crossed paths with him. Now Kelsie hunted for his number through various people who knew him and got it. She never directly got it from him as he had made an excuse not to give it to her. Now before this final part let me just say Jon had a very beautiful girlfriend and everyone knew he was not single. Kelsie texted him at night...not with a ""hello"" or a ""whats up"" like Ron had sent her. No the first thing she sends to Jon is a straight up nude and says ""I find you very attractive...DTF?"".

Ironically Ron the less good looking one was consideres a creep for polite normal texts and for getting her number the proper way. Yet Kelsie hunted for Jon's number from outside sources and maybe even the internet...then proceeds to send a straight nude to someone who already has a girlfriend without even a ""hello"". Yet she does not consider her behavior creepy. But Ron was creepy for just being nice and normal. Society has a messed up perspective depending on who you are.",1656863568.0
60,Provision Is Essential To Manhood,0,vqytzv,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vqytzv/provision_is_essential_to_manhood/,22,"**TL;DR: Become a provider in the sense that you secure your influence and power to attract women because it's masculine.**

Some background - I found this sub years and years ago. I'm familiar with the sidebar and the mantras. I visit from time to time now. As I continue to develop myself more as a men's online magazine owner and writer I hope to contribute when possible. I welcome the criticism and barbs. 

What I aim to address in this post is the propensity from other members to often misconstrue provision as feminine or 'beta' behavior by: selling exciting anecdotes about homeless men or prison convicts achieving incredible success with women, painting financial success as an unessential aspect of becoming successful with women, and illustrating with persuasive argument that money can be substituted by game or looks.

What many fail to understand is that success with women is achieved in degrees and attraction is not homogenous. That is to say - money creates a different type of attraction or psychological behavior. That's not obvious to the average man I'd argue. The attraction to a man with muscles is not the same for a handsome, suave intelligent one. Optimally, we want the full experience of a woman's attraction and sexual interest hence the striving to become a well-rounded alpha. What we witness in real life is an endless testimony of men maxing out one criterion or combination of criteria that attract women and espouse that to be the secret ingredient. Muscles, game, height, looks, status, intelligence, and money all produce different types of sexual attraction in women, and it is a beautiful thing. The song and dance of improving those aspects of ourselves and putting it on the market is truly remarkable. 

Money signals one of the core tenets of manhood for women and their biological makeup: provision. It's a trope in this sub to condescend the ideal of becoming a provider. She'll never give you the sexual experience she'll give the man who treats her like a whore, and on and on. That's very immature, surface-level idolizing. Provision is essential to manhood. You must provide for yourself. You must provide for your family. My grandfather had 8 children as a farmer. He wasn't rich, but he was a provider. I'm sure he didn't spare an expense once in a while to roll in the hay. Becoming the provider makes you more dominant, more assertive, and if it doesn't then you know money was not the issue in your relationship with women. You're not getting the sex you want because you do not know your value.

You can be tall, handsome, muscular, charming, financially successful even. However, if you are not a provider and fulfilling that instinctive aspect of your manhood and masculinity - you will not get the full experience of a woman's sexual interest. Blowing all your money on nice things for yourself is alright if you've made sure you've taken care of the people who are your foundation, your power base. That doesn't always mean family. That could mean a CEO who gives his employees a raise instead of buying a new Corvette.

I'm not saying pay her bills, take her out to fancy dates, buy her things, or sell yourself as a secure bet. I'm saying you should take care of your family, your base, or your community as an essential element of securing your influence and power. So do what you want with your money, but consider becoming a provider as a crucial element of your masculinity and see if it doesn't change your behavior towards women in a more successful way.",1656907848.0

62,I’m talking to a chick who has a BF,82,vn1ezg,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vn1ezg/im_talking_to_a_chick_who_has_a_bf/,136,"So I’ve been working at the supplement store for the past month, so that I can save up for my post grad and get some discounts and overall just find my summer vacation.
The benefits of working here aside from the discounts is the amount of attractive girls that come in daily.
I’m ngl, I’m pretty good looking. I’m 6ft, jacked, black, got good facial hair, nice smile and I’m a good conversationalist which is why I’ve been killing it in sales.
So every now and then When a girl that catches my eye comes in I try to transition the conversation away from sales to see if they’re interested l. I’ve gotten a few numbers.

So this one chick that came In a few weeks back might be the most attractive one I’ve seen.
She’s about 5’3, super petite fit body with a bubble but, light brown hair, green eyes. She came in wearing the tiniest shorts ever and asked me a question about protein supps. We ended up vibing and talking for like an hour. She works at the gym in the same plaza. I got her number.
At some point during our text she mentioned she has a boyfriend.
So here’s the catch, I told her straight up that I’m into her and she said she’s into me too and still wants to chill.
We ended up getting coffee and we’re hanging out again soon and we’ve been talking.

The other day however, I ran into her at our store and she was with this guy who I presume is her man.
Her and I spoke normally, but I can tell she was tryna keeping it on the lows about us.

So I got a look at the guy and he seems like a total cuck. 
I can tell just by their body language and dynamic that he doesn’t fuck her right.

So her and I are linking up on Wednesday and get this, her bf was never ever mentioned since that one time.
In fact, when she was at the store with him I would notice her starring at me from afar nearly breaking her neck.

So this won’t be the first time that I been talking to a girl with a man, but it is the first time it’s happened like this.

She’s super into fitness and so am I and I can tell she has one thing for the “Tyrone” archetype.
It seems to me like he’s very Abercrombie and finch and in a way not that manly. He’s super skinny pretty boy type and I can tell she probably cheats all the time.

How often do you guys deal with girls like this?

Do most women step out and get it from other guys when they’re in relationships?",1656460113.0
63,[FIELD REPORT] Pulled a blonde girl from a gay club,77,vmnlsy,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vmnlsy/field_report_pulled_a_blonde_girl_from_a_gay_club/,46,"**Stats:**

Age: 28

Race: Eastern Asian

Height: 5'7

Location: Las Vegas

**Preface:** I've been scaling back on game in the last 2 weeks. I think it's due to a mixture of feeling like I'm plateauing and getting burnt out from the clubs. I still love doing this but I gotta change it up. To combat the plateauing issue, I'm going to resume this course I bought when I first started game (todd v verbal game academy for those wondering). I'm also going to try different venues. The clubs are getting repetitive and 90% of the girls are tourist. I want to meet more local girls which led me to the gay club.

The gay club has it's perks. It's a very sex positive environment with essentially no competition. There are still some attractive girls. Volume isn't as high as the night clubs but that's expected. Another thing is that the gay club ""peaks"" later on at night. So what I've been doing the last two weekends is that I go to the regular clubs from 11-1 or 2am and then head over to the gay club which goes on until 4am whereas regular clubs are dying down by 2:30-3am. I've actually been finding better results at the gay club these last two weekends.

**Sets:**

1. I see this very hot white girl walking across the dance floor by herself. I open with a push pull per usual. Turns out she's canadian. I've hooked up with a few canadian girls recently so I use my past reference experience to make cold reads on her. I essentially make cold reads until the set hooks and then try to find jump off points to a more genuine and authentic conversation/interaction. The set hooked pretty quickly, within 2 minutes. We're just talking about canada related topics. This whole time we're chatting, I'm doing incremental physical escalation to calibrate how receptive she is. I could tell she likes me so I grab her hand and tell her ""come dance with me"". She complies and we're now grinding front to front. About a minute in, I go for the make out. Now we're making out. We're grinding and making out for a good 5 minutes. Then she tells me she has to find her brother and friends. I grab her number and we part ways. I didnt mind too much. That was my first set at the gay club and the night was still young.

&#x200B;

2. Hot black girl at the corner with her 3 friends. She had a very attractive face along with a banging body. I walked pass her friends and opened her with a push pull. I'm feeling pretty confident at this point since I just made out with the canadian girl (set 1) so I go for higher risk direct verbals. She's smiling and giggling. I could tell she's feeling me but I wanted a verbal transition into a kiss so I ask her ""have you ever kissed a cute asian boy before?"". She says no and I go in for the kiss. It works. Her male gay cousin enters the set and I introduce myself. I tell the whole group ""let's all go to the dance floor"". They agree. I grab her by her hand and lead to the dance floor. Now we're grinding. 5 minutes in I try to isolate. She said she can't leave her friends but told me to text her since she lives in Vegas. I grab her number and bounce.

&#x200B;

3. I see a hot blonde girl standing with friends on the second floor balcony. I approach and open her. I make a couple cold reads until it hooks. Turns out she has a thing for asian guys. Her ex of 3 years was asian. She's receptive towards the physical escalation and introduced me to her friend. I chatted with her friend a little bit for group management purposes. Then I tell her ""let's all go to the dance floor"". She agrees and I lead her to the dance floor. Once we're there, I take her hand and slowly bring her closer to me and now we're grinding. I go in for the make out. Success.

We dance for like 2-3 minutes and then her whole group shows up. They were friendly and engaging me so I was chatting with them. Just more group management. Basically, for the next 20-30 minutes, I'm chatting with her group and grinding with her. I knew the next step was to isolate so I told her ""hey let's go outside, it's hella hot in here"". She agrees and tells her group that she's going outside with me.

We sit outside and just chat. No game-y shit here. Just a genuine conversation. We chat for 10 minutes and then her friends show up. By now, I've seeded the pull multiple times already. I've told her to come hang out with me at my place afterwards 3 times at different points during the night. So after her friends joined us outside, I was just sitting back and seeing how this plays out. From their conversation, I could tell she was gonna come home with me so I just kept it cool. Continue to build rapport with her friends. Her friends left and I'm like SWEET. I tell her aight let's head out, take her hand, and led her out of the club. We get back to my place and yall know how it goes ;)

**Key Take Aways:**

1. Be open minded: Gay clubs are great but I know alot of dudes would write them off because it’s not a conventional venue. Dont write off a venue or idea just because it’s unorthodox. One thing game has taught me is to be more open minded. Anything can work. Just because something sounds unconventional, lame, or cringe to you, doesnt mean it doesnt work. Field test it and see for yourself. For example, the cute asian boy line. I sometime get hate for that line because it’s cRiNgE but I also get hella results from that line.
2. Dont get complacent: just like anything else in life, game is something you can always keep learning and get better at. Im feeling like Im plateauing so I've decided to resume the course I bought months ago. There’s always room for improvement.
3. Don't rely on indicators of interests (IOIs): I constantly see people advising other men to look for IOIs which is so inefficient and dumb. This blonde girl had ZERO idea of my existence until I opened her. Turns out I'm just her type. If I was relying on IOIs then I would have never pulled her. You wanna know if she's attracted to you? Go fucking talk to her and find out. That's how. Fuck IOIs.
4. Lead: Noticed how I always lead in all my sets. Just lead.
5. Group management: I don't really do this often but for set 3 I did. Nothing fancy. Just build rapport and gain their approval. I personally dont really like group management because it bores me but I guess it did help in set 3. They were willing to leave her with me.
6. Seed the pull: Before the blonde girl and her friends parted way at the end of the night, I've already tried for the pull multiple times. You should always seed the pull or try for the pull before the ""end"" of the night. I was trying for the pull since we were on the dance floor. This way, by the time her friends joined us outside again, there's no confusion on her part. If she doesn't leave with her friends then we all know what's up.",1656423809.0
64,How to be Dominant,226,vlwxz2,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vlwxz2/how_to_be_dominant/,45,"Note: This is a draft from my upcoming book so I am looking for criticisms, stories I could add, real world examples, etc.

The alpha male is dominant, which simply means he gives the orders and does not take orders. Dominance is only a question of who gives the orders – you can have more money than a woman, be smarter than her, taller than her, etc.., but if she successfully gives you orders more than you give her orders, she is dominant, not you.

As discussed earlier, women have a deep, subconscious drive to want to be dominated by the alpha male, because being dominated allows the woman to enter the alpha male’s world and enjoy a superior emotional experience. If the alpha male is a good leader, the woman feels safe, protected, and like she can offload the risks and responsibilities of the adventure onto the alpha male. Imagine you were in a burning building and a firefighter showed up to help lead you out of the building – you would listen to everything the firefighter said because you would be afraid that if you disobeyed his commands you would get swallowed by the fire. In the same way, women subconsciously feel like if the alpha male is not in charge, she must face the unknown and the threats therein on her own. 

Women also want to obey the alpha male because he is the most competent and fearless member of the tribe, so listening to him will cause them to have more fun. If you like basketball and had the opportunity to be coached by Michael Jordan, you would let Jordan tell you what to do because you knew that following his orders would make you a better basketball player. For the same reason, women feel an impulse to follow the alpha’s commands. With you in charge, she is assured she is pursuing the best purpose, the “team” (you and her) will succeed, and the tribe will not judge her or reject her for what she is doing.

Women also want to be dominated because women subconsciously have a desire to make the alpha male happy. Women subconsciously feel like if the alpha male is doing whatever he wants and not taking orders from her, he is more likely to accept her into the tribe. In a weird way, the more random and arbitrary the alpha male acts, the more safe and secure women feel in their acceptance. 

Dominance does not mean you get to be mean, pushy, abusive, annoying, or overbearing. Women do not want to be dominated by a guy who makes their emotional experience worse. If you re a loser eating Cheetos and watching Friends reruns, no woman will want to take orders from her. If you are making her do things which make her feel bad, or if your emotional experience is boring, corny, or shitty for whatever reason, women would rather leave your tribe and face the unknown on their own. As just like woman have a powerful desire to be dominated by the alpha male, they have just as strong a desire to NOT be dominated by men they do not perceive as the alpha male. Giving yourself completely to a man makes you weak and vulnerable, so the last thing evolution wants is for a woman to completely place her fate in the hands of a weak, indecisive, beta male. 

Women, therefore, only want to follow a man’s orders after she has emotionally invested in him as the alpha male. And a woman will only emotionally invest in a man as the alpha male after she has tested his emotional experience to ensure it is fun, safe, and reliable. You cannot walk up to a woman in a bar you do not know and put a BDSM collar on her; she needs to buy into your emotional experience first. If a woman is sucking your dick in the bedroom, and you say “turn around and let me fuck you from behind you little slut,” she will get turned on. But if you say that to a cashier at Whole Foods you just met, she will call the police.

Establishing dominance, therefore, requires patience because you can and should only give a woman orders after she WANTS to take orders from you. This takes time – before you can give a woman a command, you must wait until she has emotionally invested in you enough to want to follow that command. As she slowly emotionally invests, you give her bigger and bigger orders. For example, if you approach a woman in a bar you cannot immediately say “let’s go back to my apartment” – she is not emotionally invested enough in you to leave with you yet. Instead, when you approach you have a nice conversation, and then when you sense she is emotionally invested enough in the conversation, you can say “hey let’s walk over here where it is less loud.” Bam! You have now given her a command that she has followed. Later, when the woman emotionally invests in you enough to want to go to a different venue with you, you can say “let’s go to this other bar across the street.” Bam! She has now followed another command! Every time you give her a command and she follows it, she grows more emotionally invested (bonus points if following your command causes something fun and positive to happen). You keep this cycle going until the commands become more serious, all the way until you are instructing her about sex positions. 

There is, however, a balance here. Women will resist following your commands at first as they shit test you to determine if your emotional experience is worth joining. But the moment the woman has emotionally invested enough to want to take orders from you, you must quickly capitalize and be firm, assertive, and confident. If a woman makes clear she wants you to lead her, and you bullshit on taking the lead, she will lose attraction and go elsewhere. 

If you are clever, you can get a woman to emotionally invest in you more quickly by giving her small little orders she does not even notice. For example, you can say things like “hey can you hold my a drink for a second while I check my phone?” or “hey can you grab me a beer from the fridge?” So long as her rational mind does not notice you are “giving her orders” she will comply and subconsciously emotionally invest in a tiny bit. You can also give these kinds of micro-orders in a conversation. If a woman is telling you about how she bakes a cookie, you can say “oh, cool, what’s your recipe?” If she tells you the recipe, she has followed a command you have given her. 

You must also maintain dominance in conversations. You must lead the conversation, choose the topics, and changing the subject when it gets boring, stupid, or otherwise uninteresting. You should also avoid agreeing with everything she says. And of course, you should also refuse to comply with commands related to conversation as well. For example, if you are an accountant and a woman asks you for accounting advice before she has done anything to deserve it, your answer should be “no.”

The key to dominance is consent. On a conscious, rational level, nobody wants to be told what to do. Women especially hate being controlled because every beautiful woman has had some corny, boring, insecure guy ruin her emotional experience by keeping her from doing fun things she enjoyed doing. When beautiful women dump their boyfriends, they often complain that he was controlling, possessive, and cramped their emotional experience.

Womens’ desire for domination exists on a subconscious level, so your domination of her must happen subtly, subconsciously, and smoothly in the natural flow of the interaction. In other words, you must give orders without looking like you are trying to give orders. You do not establish dominance by yelling “I make the rules in this house bitch!!” or by forcing your dominance on women. You establish dominance by creating a fun emotional experience, enjoying that emotional experience, and then slowly allowing women to enter that emotional experience after they emotionally invest in you by doing things for you. A woman should never feel like you are trying to tell her what to do – if anything, women should feel like you are reluctant to allow her into your world and give her orders. Like everything you provide, your dominance is a gift and she must feel like she must work to obtain it. 

For example, if a woman asks my advice on something, I sometimes say “I don’t like to tell women what to do, but what I would do is…” or if a woman asks what we are doing I say, “I’m gonna go to Jimmy’s, you can come if you want.” Womens’ acceptance of my dominance is purely voluntary, and they can get off the train at any time. And when women know they are free to leave whenever they want, they are more likely to want to join. 

Men have a natural desire to be the alpha and dominate, and often get impatient and give orders too soon, before the woman has emotionally invested enough. For example, I once saw a guy text a woman before a first date: “Wear a cute, slutty dress to our date” and the woman replied “I will wear whatever the fuck I want.” The guy made a rookie mistake – he tried to give her orders before she was emotionally invested enough to want to take them. His attempt at giving orders was also too obvious and visible to her rational mind, so her red flags went up. You must be careful because women are much more attuned to power games than men are, and usually notice when you are trying to establish dominance before they are ready.  

You should also be careful about telling women how to live their lives. If a woman is a communist, majors in left-handed puppetry, smokes cigarettes, or tries to cure her cancer with patchouli oil, telling her she is making bad life choices will not get her to change her behavior. Women often subconsciously interpret friendly, reasonable advice as an attempt to control her and violently resist if they have not emotionally invested in the man giving the advice (and think about it – a woman needs to emotionally invest in you A LOT to make major life decisions like stop smoking or being a communist because of you). Unless the stupid thing she is doing is small and easily fixable, just nod and smile as she tells you how she is ruining your life.  

Most men cannot resist telling women what to do and how to live their life. Telling a woman what to do before she has emotionally invested is a beta because it subconsciously feels like you are taking responsibility for fixing her life before she deserves it. If you can refrain from giving into your impulse to tell her what to do and trying to “fix” her, you will stand out as different from other men. I have even seen women act surprised when they said something shocking about themselves and I did not act judgmental or preachy. 

Some people might think that worrying about dominance and who is in “charge” in social interactions is over-thinking. I disagree. Women are constantly subconsciously testing your domination and playing power games, and if you are not aware of these games, you will slowly and imperceptibly fall into her frame. Most men have no idea women are playing power games and just comply with womens’ requests to “make her happy,” which ends up relegating them to the beta position in the relationship. 

**Dominance and Shit Tests**

The appear dominant, you must say “no” to her at least once or twice in the interaction. If a woman does not know you, she usually starts with the assumption that you are beta, so you must go out of your way to say no so her subconscious mind knows you give orders and do not take orders. You should say no even if she is not asking you to do anything. You do not need to say “no” in a dramatic or douchey way – in fact, you can say “no” as a joke to something completely silly and unimportant. For example, if the woman says “wow, you are amazing at karaoke, you should go on American Idol!” you can respond “No, definitely not! I need a record deal first.” Even very light, silly nos will solidify the distance of power in your relationship. 

To remain dominant, you do not need to say “no” to every single thing she asks of you. You can, and should, say yes every once in a while. Dominance is a feeling, not a strict rule, and that feeling should be “the guy is generally in charge of this relationship.” In a normal, healthy relationship, both parties sometimes tell each other what to do, and if you say “no” to every single thing she asks you to do her rational mind will make look like an insecure lunatic. 

Before women submit to your dominance, they will often shit test you to determine if your frame is strong. A common power shit test is a power battle, where she will try to give you orders and resist taking your orders. If you obey her orders, you fail. But you must be careful to say “no” in a way that does not make it look like you are petulant child. Remember, this game exists purely on the level of the subconscious – you do not want her to consciously think you are battling her for your position as the alpha. 

When determining whether to comply with a woman’s demands, I use the following rules: 

First, if she asks for something reasonable that she has done something to deserve (i.e., she has followed my commands in the past), then I will just do it for her. For example, if I ask her to hang out and she asks me to pick her up, I will pick her up because I am picking her up to hang out with me. But the moment her demand becomes unreasonable or undeserved, I stop complying. For example, if I have been talking to a woman at a bar for an hour and she asks me to hold her purse while she grabs something out of her purse, I will do it because it would look insane if I announced “I do not hold women’s drinks!! I am the alpha male here!!” But if I am holding her drink and she wanders off to talk to other people, I put her drink down or go give it back to her. Holding her drink for a few seconds while she reaches in her purse is reasonable; holding her drink for 5 minutes while she chats with her friends is not. 

Second, if she asks for something clearly absurd she does not deserve, I either ignore her request, laugh it off, or make fun of her for even asking. For example, if we are waiting in line to get into a concert and she says “pay for my ticket” I will look at her and say “I’m going to forget you even asked that.” Not only do I want to say no, I want to say no in a way that makes her not ask again. Women know when they are being unreasonable. 

Third, if she asks for something reasonable that she does not quite deserve yet, I politely explain to her why I cannot do it. For example, sometimes I meet women and within a few weeks of knowing each other they ask if they can move in with me or go on an overseas vacation with me. I politely answer, “no, I’m sorry I think it is too early.” 

When determining whether to comply with a woman’s request, you must use your common sense and emotional intelligence. If a woman gets hit by a bus and asks you to call the ambulance, you should do so out of a purely moral obligation even if she does not technically “deserve it” from you. If a woman asks you to go get the car for her so she does not have to walk through the snow in high heels, again, you should say yes, even if she does not technically deserve it. You should seem like a normal human being, not a robot obsessed with power. And furthermore, if you are playing the game correctly, you will have built up so many “alpha” points that you can do a few “beta” things and not ruin your frame. 

As I explained earlier, women do not like to lead because leadership requires responsibility and creates anxiety. Nevertheless, women sometimes try to take the lead either because they think they are more competent to lead in a certain environment or because they have not emotionally invested in you enough yet. In these situations, instead of fighting over who is in charge, I follow the woman’s leadership but start to drift off every time the interaction begins to get lame. Once she sees that I am drifting off, the anxiety usually becomes overwhelming for her and she hands the leadership back to me. Sometimes if the adventure fails badly enough, I will just say “ok, I’m not listening to you anymore. I am in charge now.” For example, if we are walking around the city on a date and she is leading the way, if we go down a boring street I will make fun of her and then take the lead back from her. 

Your biggest weapon in a dominance battle is your ability to leave. If she insists on taking the lead and doing things that make the interaction not fun for you, just pretend you have somewhere better to be. That’s all you need to do. You should use your own judgment regarding when and when not to leave, but generally speaking, a good way to determine whether a woman is emotionally invested in you is to look at how much she wants to follow your orders. Women naturally want to let a man take the lead, so if a woman has gotten to know you but still resists your leadership, she has not emotionally invested in you and sees you as either just a friend or somebody she can get things from. 

Saying no to women is hard because you are always taking a chance she will take your “no” badly and leave. This is not a completely irrational fear - some women WILL leave if you do not give them what they want. But think about it – women want to be dominated by a man they find attractive, so if a woman leaves you because you will not do something for her, she likes that thing, not you. And sometimes when you say no a woman will get angry and leave in a huff, and then come back later once she realizes that you are an alpha male who will hold frame and stand his ground.

Sometimes women take your “no” badly and try to argue to make you say yes. A woman might beg, tell you a sob story, insult you (for example, calling you cheap because you will not buy her a drink), explain to you “rationally” why you should cave to their demand (for example, explaining that a gentleman takes a woman to dinner for the first date), or even try to trick you into doing the thing. If a woman keeps pressing you to do something for her, you can politely and firmly tell her why you cannot do it ONE TIME. Afterwards, you should just ignore her and move on. If you sit there and argue with her, you will appear beta because you are fighting for your dominant position. 

Sometimes women are damaged and cannot function in a relationship without being in control. These women have usually been dicked over by dominant men, so they now seek men they can dominate to 1) subconsciously get revenge and abuse the men beneath them and 2) feel safe and like the guy will not leave. When dealing with these women you can try to hold frame and become dominant by using the techniques in this section, but generally speaking, I think these women are usually so broken it is not worth trying to fix them. These women usually spend their lives jumping from beta boyfriend to beta boyfriend, occasionally taking a break to cheat with a dominant guy that treats them like shit, and then going back to the beta boyfriend. 

Whatever you do, you should not cave and let a woman boss you around even if it seems like that is the only way to her heart. No matter how much a woman thinks she wants to dominate, if you let her dominate, she will either lose interest or treat you like shit or both. “Dominant” women usually end up miserable because the thing they thought they wanted does not make them happy.

65,Commitment and consistency against men,116,vkbcpn,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vkbcpn/commitment_and_consistency_against_men/,20,"Men (and people in general) like to maintain consistency in their lives for three reasons:

* It saves time and energy. The most difficult thing to do is to think.
* It is respectable to remain consistent in life.
* It is an easy and sustainable way to navigate through life.

It can be said that men have a higher proclivity to remain consistent since men prefer to remain orderly. Women are more likely to chase excitement. The common dating advice, “you can do anything to a woman but bore her” is the proof of that. On top of it, most cultures all over the world represent men as order and women as chaos. The best example is the “yin and yang” which shows how both order and chaos are representatives of the masculine and the feminine respectively.

In this essay, I have attempted to explain how men’s tendency to remain orderly in their lives is exploited (knowingly or unknowingly) by women and society, in general, to get what they want, even if it means sacrificing the man physically and mentally.

We make a decision, a commitment, and remain consistent with it. But what makes us behave consistently towards a commitment (a decision)? We make a lot of decisions, but not a lot of them evolve to become commitments towards which we are consistent. What makes us commit to a decision consistently?

To understand it in detail, here is a small story of American POWs in communist China during the Korean war (1950-53).

## The essay competitions in China

When American soldiers who were imprisoned in China’s concentration camps returned to their motherland after the war was over, the military officers discovered that their opinions about democracy and communism were very different than what they used to be. Psychologists and researchers dug deep to find out what has transpired during their time in the Chinese prisons.

They found out that in those prisons, the guards (and the administration) held essay competitions where American soldiers had to write praises about the Communist Party of China and/or mock the democratic form of governance in some form way. Of course, most American soldiers resisted, but the fact is they didn’t have to write a lot (in terms of depth) to flatter the administrators to “win” the essay competitions. All they had to do was write things along the lines of “the democratic system is not perfect” and “although Communism appears to have a lot of problems, it does work for the people of China” and so on.

The prize for the winners was nothing extraordinary. It was a pack of cigarettes or a couple of extra hours of yard time. The purpose of it was to ensure that the imprisoned soldiers write the things they write because they believe in them, not because they are motivated by external incentives.

In the subsequent essay competitions, the little truths were elaborated on which the American imprisoned soldiers went the distance and critiqued the American government deeply while citing the great developmental activities completed by the communists for the people of China.

After listening to what has happened in the camps, the researchers and psychologists have found out the parameters that make men behave consistently towards a commitment.

## What the psychologists concluded

There are three things that make us commit to an earlier decision in a consistent way:

1. **Effort**: The decision (the first instance of the activity) should be effortful. In the above example, writing an essay. Although it is not physically demanding, writing requires a lot of mental effort.
2. **Internally motivated**: The prizes offered were mundane. No one in their right mind would betray their hierarchy of values for a pack of cigarettes. It is impossible to make someone naturally comply with something by the application of external force. It has to be internally motivated. In the above example, no one forced those soldiers to write those things, they consciously did it themselves. (Obviously, the Chinese put some form of indirect pressure, but in the minds of imprisoned soldiers, it was internally motivated.)
3. **Public**: The prizes were awarded publicly within the premises of the prison where the winner had to read out their essay. This reinforces the image that they have forged in the eyes of the public. As I mentioned at the beginning, it is respectable to act consistently and even though they were not in prison anymore, they continued to.

Now, you must be getting the idea of how the above tools have been used by the gynocentric society (and the protectors of it) against men.

## Commitment and consistency against men

If you look at the “courting rules” in modern society through the lens of the lesson derived from the story above, it will become evident how women (and society) extract commitment and consistency from men by making the initial and subsequent instances of the courting activity effortful, internally motivated, and public.

Let’s take a look at them one by one. (More examples are welcome.)

### Effortful - bending over backward

Even though the public perception is that “women make the biggest sacrifices”, it is seldom true during the dating phase. The man is expected to dress well, pick up the girl, get to the restaurant early in case the girl is directly coming there, etc. The list is practically endless. Albeit it is true that women like men who are confident and lead well, the material expectation is huge.

Buying her flowers, taking her to a nice restaurant, paying the bill, etc., are all effortful activities that a man is doing. Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying that you shouldn’t do it or cease being a gentleman. I am stating that making the initial instance effortful is part of the reason men are more likely to chase women. It is employed by women and society in general to secure a commitment from the man. 

That is the reason why even in the days of absolute feminism, where women take pride in paying their bills (which they should be doing anyways), men are still expected to put in the extra effort such as picking her up, courting her, etc. It seldom ends and the degree of effort continually increases as more is demanded from the man in the subsequent stages of a relationship, both emotionally, physically, and materially.

### Internally motivated - there is no prize

When you take a girl on a date, you should not expect sex. That is what millions of men are being taught on the regular by the protectors of the gynocentric social order. Even if you are married to the woman, you should not pester her to have sex for a myriad of reasons. The conclusion is you are a horndog and should learn to control yourself.

This leaves one message deep in your subconscious. The only reason you are sacrificing your time with the boys or sleeping in on a Sunday or having your favorite music on the speakers is that you want to. Even though the possibility of the prize could be zero, you are still doing it. More importantly, you are brainwashed to think that you are not doing it for the sex, you are doing it because she is a special person and you like her. 

Society reinforces this by removing accountability for women and forcing men (directly and indirectly) to not have any expectations from a woman, especially those of sexual nature just because she got a free meal out of him.

### Public - post it on the ‘gram

Holding hands in public, going shopping together, revealing to friends and family that you are dating, etc., are all examples of activities that are public-facing. These activities solidify the commitment and rarely fails to secure consistent behavior from the man. The fundamental here is the image of the man is integrated with the woman he is with and hence he will be interpreted as “incomplete and incoherent” if he is without her or behaves in a way that could piss his partner off.

Events such as proposing a woman tick all the boxes above. It is effortful as a man needs to plan the proposal, save money for the ring and the wedding, etc. It is internally motivated that you should not just expect “yes” from a woman and you are proposing because you love her and she is an amazing person. It is public for obvious reasons.

**Note**: There are two more motivators that act as catalysts that coerce men to do things that make them more prone to commit to women. Those two things are shame and praise. The gynocentric society has created a definition of “a good man” and men who fall within that are praised and the rogue ones are shamed. Keep in mind that the definition of “a good man” doesn’t even consider the needs of the man, rather it thrives on their sacrifice. Once they make a man accept that he is “a good man”, they force him to act consistently to maintain that image.

This subreddit has done a great job in writing in-depth guides related to that so I will stop talking about that here.

## Defense against commitment and consistency

As we live in a society where speaking the truth will make you an object of laughter and sneer, it will be difficult not to do anything that could extract commitment out of you towards a woman and make you behave consistently towards her.

However, the solution to the above challenge is already described in various articles in this subreddit. Here are some bullets, feel free to elaborate or provide more tips.

1. Even if you make an effort that is internally motivated and is public-facing, always be ready to walk away and label it as a “bad investment”. You will make mistakes, the worst thing is to hold on to them. Do not water a dead plant.
2. Look at what they are doing. If the investment by the woman is not at least equivalent, if not more, it is more likely that they are not as attached as you. Beware of intangible investments such as, “I think about you all the time” that women use during arguments. They cannot be proven or refuted. They are to be ignored.
3. Restrict your efforts. Be a gentleman, but if a woman is flaky, pull back to the max. There is also no need to take huge leaps in the early stage of a relationship no matter how special you think she is. Women pester for commitment after some time, but that is societal pressure at work. See point 2 and commit only if she is also as invested.

(Keep in mind that the above points are to be used against the compliant tactics discussed in this essay. Other RP points like, “focus on yourself” and “test her character” are useful too, but they are too general in the context of this essay.)

For more details, please read Influence by Dr. Robert Cialdini. (The story of American soldiers is from Chapter 2 of that book. I extrapolated the lessons from it and applied it in the context of dating in the modern age.)

Again, do share examples from your real life if you think it fits the context of this essay and will help others learn about the gynocentric social order.

# Introduction

I haven't gamed girls properly in around 2 years. Things were going fine before the pandemic, but during lockdown, I lost control over my life and went into some great depths of depression, and up until this point, I am still slowly getting back on track. As the city started opening up again, events started happening and such, I am back to meeting girls as regularly as I used to before the pandemic broke out, but one thing I noticed is that I have almost completely forgotten how to have a good conversation with girls. To be fair, I was never good at conversations. When I learnt how to do it properly, it was by reading a lot of posts on this sub. Coming back to this sub trying to find the posts proved to be a painful process, so I started looking more on here and elsewhere and learnt quite a few handy rules and techniques on how to converse with anyone (girls specifically) and I complied them into his post which I hope will help rusty people like me get back on track faster.

Okay, with all of that out of the way, let's jump right into it.

# Fundamentals

By fundamentals, I mean passive skills that you will not be actively doing throughout the interaction with the girl, but they will be in the back of your mind.

**The 90/10 rule**

The person talking is the person investing. You want to do minimal talking that is limited to leading her to talk more about herself. The conversation needs to be 90% about her, 10% about you. This is very critical to build attraction and to make her think that she's known you her entire life.

This is great because it discloses little information about you and it builds suspense and mystery which is what you want to have. Usually by the end of the date, you want to disclose where you're from, what you've studied in the past, what you're currently working/doing, what are your general hobbies and motivation behind them, AND THAT'S IT. But more on this later.

**Positivity**

Positivity can be confused with being overly optimistic and happy, looking more like a joker than a guy who wants to have fun. It is also referred to sometimes as self-amusement. It means that your vibes, the topics of your conversation, your perspectives, your questions, and everything in between have to maintain that ""I am here to have a good time and I shall act as such"". For instance, you won't talk about your work and vent about how shitty your colleagues are. You won't let her talk about her ex boyfriend or stepfather and how much of dicks they were. Avoid venting, negative and instant mood-killing topics.

**Eye contact**

This one has been discussed on here a lot. When you speak with someone, you don't stare directly in their souls and make them feel uncomfortable, neither do you look away all the time and not pay attention to them, you want to look at them straight in the eye when they are talking to you, and when there is nothing to talk about (more on this later) you are allowed to look away. It is just awkward to have someone talking to you and you're looking away like you're not paying attention to them.

With girls, you want to look into for example the left eye, then the right eye, circle down to her mouth while she talks, then look back up to her left eye. You want to keep looking in circles on her face as she is talking. This is a great tip for kino escalation.

**Voice and manners of speaking**

You want to be audible. Not obnoxiously shouting, but you want to be heard. Imagine being a bar with many people around, and you just have to speak a bit louder than usual to make yourself heard: that's how you want to speak, so people can just hear you.

Don't use voice inflections. Inflections is also called uptalk, it's when you come at the end of a statement and you go up and make it sound like a question. This means that you're trying to be nice, don't want to be interrupted or just unsure of what you're saying: don't do that. At the end of every statement, your intonation goes down.

Avoid using words such as ""Oh, Wow! That's so cool! Damn, this is NICE!"" These are feminine words. Supplicating language. You're giving her free validation. We don't do that. Anytime you feel like saying any of that, just say ""Uhm, okay"". And stop there.

**The Vacuum**

Following the previous point, the pace of your speech needs to also be significantly slower, in a way that you create some type of vacuum when you're conversing with the girl.

First of all, you don't want to interrupt her. Remember, this is about her, not you. So when she is talking, GREAT, you keep it going. But when she is done, you don't jump on the cue in a heartbeat. Try counting to 3 first, then say whichever statement/question that you have in mind. This is great because it shows that you're comfortable with being awkward and confident enough that you wouldn't give a fuck if she doesn't talk. You wanna take a sip of your beer? Go for it. She can wait. Your bro texted you a meme? Check it out, chuckle about it.

Girls usually try to fill this vacuum by initiating a conversation that usually starts with, ""Soooooo.... (questions).""

**Body Language**

Don't lean in when speaking with someone. Stand straight. A good exercise is to have your palms facing out while standing up. This will automatically push your chest forward and flex your back to have a straighter posture.

**Assuming Familiarity**

Sometimes, it is really hard to talk with strangers. Being on a date with someone you've met once or twice can be weird, this is why you have to assume that you've known this girl from a social distant social circle and you talk to her like you've just met in a flat party.

**Feminine language and questions**

95% of girls have shit game. Their texts are bland, their topics of conversation are generic, their questions are open-ended, and that's completely fine. After all, they've never really put efforts into learning how to converse because society does that for them (cue in some long monologue about The Blue Pill and a post-feminism western deteriorating society).

The thing is, guys usually have the same mindset and it is taken even further because guys are usually very efficient with their communication. They answer a question precisely, concisely, and fast. This usually leads to some really boring types of conversation that you do not want to have and this is why many dates with girls end up dead because it's like you're in an interview with her, asking her yes/no questions, talking about generic bullshit and using bland and boring language.

What you need to do to use a colorful and emotive language. Think Russel Brand. The guy spits poetry at some point. To men he looks gay, but to girls it's highly seductive. His language and topics are passionate, colorful, dreamy, ambitious, they tap into one's inner feelings and emotions and such. This is what you're going for. But more on this later.

The other thing that you need to do is to avoid ""the Questions of Doom"". These are close-ended generic boring yes/no questions that usually lead the girl to answering and then awkwardly trying to keep the conversation going by saying something random. Where are you from. What you study now. What you work. What's your favorite food. What's your favorite band. More on this later too.

**Section Conclusion**: These are the fundamentals that you need in any context in life (more specifically girls) when having a conversation with somebody just to keep the conversation going and make them feel good being around you. Just learning this is actually enough for you to make significant progress in your conversational quality. If you don't learn these and go on and learn the techniques in the following section, your success will be limited. So I highly encourage you to just get these basics done, read them and re-read them as many times as you can, and try to practice them until they're second nature to you.

# Active Conversational Techniques

These techniques shouldn't be appearing in any particular order. They are things that you can just use whenever you feel like it's the right time.

**Statement followed by a question**

This is how you keep a conversation seamlessly flowing in a natural way. This is also how you ask boring ass open-ended questions but put some spice on them.

When you would like to ask something specific of the person, try to make a statement first that would allude to the information that you're seeking. For example, you want to learn where they're from. Make a statement about their looks, accents, anything that looks remotely related to her culture. When she answers the question, look for clues in her answer and make another statement about it then follow it by a question. It really is that simple.

The statements can be cheeky/funny, or they can still be some bland objective observations about something in particular. I read on here once that using stereotypes helps a lot putting some humor to these statements. For example,

""You sound like you have a British accent. If I were to guess, you're somewhere from the northern parts of the UK?""

""Hahaha, yes, actually I'm from Scotland"".

""This is where guys wear skirts and play music on pipes in the middle of nowhere, right? Do girls get to do the same thing?""

""Hahah, yes, that is exactly the place, I'm from Edinburgh to be more accurate, born and raised there, so we don't really get to do that...blablabla"".

And this just keeps going on... and on... and on. She answers your question. You look for a clue. Make a funny/cheeky statement, ask another question, repeat. This is the barebone of an engaging conversation.

Example statements you can make:

* You look like you’ve just been (insert what she looks like she's been doing \[jogging, business meeting, studying\])
* You look very (insert adjective) because (insert observation) \[You look fit because of how good your posture is. Do you lift?\].

**Open Questions**

Statements followed by a question is a rule that can be broken whenever you feel like it. You are of course allowed to ask questions, but these have to be open questions. The kind of questions they ask you to write essays about. I think this is self-explanatory so I will just give you some example of great open questions you can use:

* What is it about (insert a clue) that you love?
* What was it like growing up in…?
* What’s the story with (insert a clue)?
* How did (insert a clue) make you feel?

**Stealth Questions**

These are questions wrapped in statements. You are making a statement that pushes her to answer a question that the statement arises. It's very stealthy and unnoticeable. For example, you can start a statement by saying, ""I don't know about you, but I think NYC in summer time is the best because people can go out, sunbathe and have fun"". 9 times out of 10 she will try to either argue otherwise or agree and add more context.

You can also compare and contrast something. She says for example that she likes skiing. You can say, ""Skiing is very similar to skateboarding because you're still gliding on some form of surface"". (ok that was such a stupid thing to say, but the point is to get them talking about their hobbies).

**Parroting**

This has got to be my favorite tool in all of this. Parroting is when you take the last few words they said and reformulate them. You're not asking anything, you're not making a statement. You're just repeating what they say as in you're saying, ""So you were saying... (insert the last few words that they said).

Example:

Her, ""I moved to Europe because of business and now I've been working as a model and it's going great!""

You, ""So you've been working as a model"".

Her, ""Yes, I've met this photographer...blabla"".

You, ""You also mentioned business"". (this is a bit extreme. I would most likely follow that by a statement).

Her, ""I'm working with consultancy firm where I'm from blabalba"".

# Content of the Conversation

**Conversation Topics**

Okay, you got the basics and techniques down. What to talk about now? Surprisingly, this is the easiest sections. To find shit to talk about, this is the best and laziest way to do so:

1. Past
2. Present
3. Future

You talk about her **past**:

* What was it like growing up in...?
* You said you’re working in IT, but what did you want to do that when you were a kid?

Tap in her past. Ask her about what happened before she moved in your city, what was it like doing this or that, open questions, statements about her past..etc.

When you run out of things to say, ask her what she's up to now, the **present**, what's going on her with life, now.

* What she’s/was doing today
* How she settled in (city)
* Are you going somewhere later?
* What activities she's up to during the week
* How her week looks like now

When you run out of topics for that, you talk about the **future**

* What her plans will be in the future
* Does she want to do what she's doing for the rest of her life
* How many kids she want to have
* Any plans to go back to uni... etc

Another very easy topics to talk about are her travels, hobbies, and passions.

**Environmental Pressure flip**

For this one, you have to use the environment to your advantage. When you practically have nothing to talk about, look around and make a statement about something you think is remotely interesting. There are a few games you can even play with her like who you would fuck, marry and kill out of the guys in the room. Or there are places that you can take her that are environmentally rich, such as the zoo, the museum, the river and such. Almost there is always something to talk about in these places and you shouldn't run out of things to say.

Another thing is to instead of being one-on-one date, you create a social bubble of ""we"". We are observing the environment we are in, we are making statements about what's going on around here, not just you and her as separate entities.

It is also interesting to make some future plans in a cheeky and playful banter. Tell her that one day you will take her to Vegas to marry her when the topic of marriage comes up. Or tell her that you know this great bar with great view on the River Thames you want to show her next time. You're not committing to this, you're letting her know that this isn't only a one-time thing and that you might linger just a little bit more.

**Your 10%**

As I mentioned above, girls have no game. At least in my experience. She will ask you about your hobbies, about your studies and work, and about some other generic bullshit boring questions.

Now, instead of answering this like a man, you want to play a game. She asks you where you're from. You tell her she has three questions to ask and three guesses and if she guesses it right she will get a cookie.

Or you just start describing where you're from and tell her to guess as you're doing it. Eventually you'll tell her, sure, but it's more interesting when you describe it.

Put a twist on your job title. Make it sound more interesting or more adventurous than it really is. If you work in sales, tell her you manipulate people into buying products for much more expensive prices than their worth, and these products are actually drugs you test before you sell...etc. Don't forget to use emotive and colorful language when talking about your hobbies.

Hobbies specifically have two layers to them. What you do literally and the motivation behind doing it. You want to always find some form of passion or interesting thing as to why you like doing what you do.

For example,

* I like doing portrait photography because I get to capture the subtleties in peoples' appearance and it's really interesting to capture people's different vibes and personalities. Some you can feel are depressed/shy by nature, others more confident and dominant... etc.
* Or let's say you like skydiving, water surfing and bungee jumping. Life is too short to sit at home and take no risks. You love adventure and you live for it.

This usually builds deep rapport and makes you look like you've connected to her on a deeper more meaningful level. This is also a perfect opportunity to open up and do your due diligent 10% of the conversation and call it a day. Usually after this, I'd try to answer as less questions from her part as possible.

# Let Her Know That You're Here to Fuck

All of what I've described above is great stuff to keep a great and engaging conversation going. However, it can easily drop you in the friendzone territory real fast, especially if you overdo it, so this is why even though you're a good and genuine listener, you still want to fuck and you let her know.

**Sexual Escalation**

People nowadays are very self-conscious about touching, so you have to proceed cautiously. I found that the best way to build sexual attraction with girls is to touch them *when justified* or as it was referred on this sub ""high points"".

High points is when something of substance occurs on this conversation. For example when she makes a joke or tells you a funny story, you tap her on the shoulder and let her know that that was hilarious. If she tells you she works out often and such, you check her biceps and tell her that they're alright. Or if you're trying to gauge her height, you pat her on the head and tell her how tiny she seems. When you are walking around and you want her to take a left, you wrap your arm around her to lead her. When you tell her that she looks younger than she is and compliment how healthy her skin looks (u caress the face) and fresh her hair seems (roll her hair on your fingers). This, and much more.

You want touching to be a normal thing during the conversation and you want it to follow the topics of the conversation. Don't sit across from her, sit next to her, keep the physical proximity to a minimum. Don't touch her somewhere inappropriate. Just have a regular banter and touch her when you want to. This will build sexual tension which usually leads to you kissing her.

**Don't be a nice and agreeable guy**

Being a genuine and thoughtful guy is a good thing, don't get me wrong. But in this context, you don't want be that guy through and through. You want to challenge her at least twice on two separate opinions. You agree and like what she is talking about most of the time, but then she trash talks your favorite show or band or when she compliments something you wholeheartedly abhor, you let her know that you disagree with what she says because of this and that, all with a smile on your face as to not come off as aggressive. This usually takes her aback and she learns that this guy although respectful and agreeable, he's not afraid to show his teeth and attack at a moment's notice.

**Make your Intentions Clear**

This is very hard for most people, even for me. You have to make your intentions clear that this conversation is me flirting with you because I find you attractive and cute and want to have some sort of a sexual rapport/relationship. You do this by throwing in a nonchalant compliment about something that she says. For example, you can tell her that you can't make what color her eye is and you find them captivating. Or you can tell her to smile again because it looks like a Hollywood type of smile. You can comment on how fit she looks and that you straight up like her curves. You let her know that you just find here attractive.

**Make her qualify herself to you**

When she makes a controversial statement, you ask her to justify yourself or to explain something more. This will make her automatically seek your validation and approval and puts her in a supplicating type of position which builds attraction without even knowing it.

Also make statements saying that you wouldn't for instance date girls who study art/computer science/economics..etc but she looks not like the other girls and you'd give her a pass.

# Conclusion

Well, there you have it, folks. I hope this will be of help to some of you coming back to game after a few years of being off, and I hope people will find the content of this article useful into honing their skills and becoming a more sociable and a guy people can talk to easier and be around more.

67,Relevancy and Learning Game,12,vjq8fm,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vjq8fm/relevancy_and_learning_game/,4,"[All men by nature desire to know.](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.1.i.html) When it comes to questioning on the ""meaning"" of things, as you should do, it is better to consider their ""relevance"". Relevance is a practical notion of meaning particular to you. The more crucial aspect of learning game is to know very well why **you** are learning game, going out, and trying to get laid. What is your true motivation? Idealism (metaphysical meaning) is great and all as point to strive towards, but it may simply not be exactly relevant to you at your point in life and thus not a sufficient motivation. Without satisfactory motivation or purpose, your activity will be hopeless.

How can you apply this? Sit down and think, for as long as it takes, why you want to get laid until you feel you have reached a satisfying understanding of **your** purpose.

One thing among many for me is that I've realized that I had a sort of ""self hate"" for not having a voracious sex drive, ""pit bull tenacity"", and being unable to freely express my sexual desire. I've always felt myself different from others in this way and being less than for it. The daily stress of this lack would drive me to damn near suicide if I was unable to figure this shit out. Regardless of the truth of the matter with respect to how other people actually experience their sex drive and so on, this notion of myself was extremely relevant and in connecting with it by being honest with myself, I found the proper congruent motivation for carrying an interaction all the way to sex in spite of very basic fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

We are drawn towards pleasure or away from pain. When you are in your head by default, stifled, neurotic as most people are, **the escape from pain is the far more relevant motivation**, as unideal and un-[Pook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaklRDhNkZY)ish as that may be. I knew full well that if I was unable to express my sexual desire, my life would be an endless cycle of pain. I could go on about the catastrophic scenario painted in my mind but I'll save that for my hard drive. The point is that this motivation was relevant to my mental state and my self-concept and my history and so on and without that sufficient relevant congruence, I would have never pushed beyond my comfort zone.

[""The unexamined life is not worth living,"" spoke Socrates.](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/apology.html) ""Know thyself"" is written at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Be shameless in sitting down, spending the time to introspect, and being honest with yourself about who have grown up to be, and what it is that you want and more importantly **do not want**. Write it all out. You will know when you have struck gold because you will get up, go outside, and make it happen. The information you need will make itself apparent to you. It will simply make plain sense to you because it will have become completely relevant and resonant with you.

Your truth shall set you free.",1656082286.0
68,The most hyper feminist women I've ever slept with are the ones that enjoy being degraded and humiliated the most.,553,vgzm3c,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vgzm3c/the_most_hyper_feminist_women_ive_ever_slept_with/,129,"A couple years ago I slept with two VERY feminist women a few months apart. Their rants about men and the patriarchy outside of the bedroom were legendary, but once they started getting turned on, they wanted me to do things to them that no other women has ever wanted me to do. Some of it was so degrading that I actually refused to do it. Now, if you're kinky that's fine, but it's not typically my thing (dominance is plenty for me), and while I'm all for a little exploration here and there, I'm (personally) not interested in violently face fucking a tied up chick while she chokes and gags on my cock... and I was kinda caught off guard (at the time), to find out that they both wanted... very rough treatment both physically \*and\* psychologically, from me. **Their sexual requests from a man were the antithesis of everything they had been saying about men all day.** (I basically ignored their requests, did what I wanted, and was done with it.)

I suspect there's a major psychological compensation at play here for these women who have been brainwashed with the modern narrative. They want to be submissive so badly that all that suppressed energy comes out as soon as they start getting aroused. They truly have no clue what they really want and usually have the highest levels of depression and anxiety you can find in their gender. This could be (sexually) capitalized on in another time period, but in the modern world, fucking these women is like playing with fire for self-evident reasons. Needless to say it wasn't very long after that that I decided to no longer pursue outspoken feminists, regardless of how hot they were. There are tens of millions of other women out there one can pursue without playing Russian Roulette with a bitch who spews vitriol about men outside of the bedroom, and then wants vitriol spewed on her BY men once the clothes come off.",1655769623.0
69,Why Self Improvement?,161,vghle4,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vghle4/why_self_improvement/,31,"To any man reading this, I'm sure you're all familiar with the advice to ""just be yourself"" when it comes to interacting with women. And while there's some truth to that, the fact is that women are attracted to confident, successful men. So if you're not working on improving yourself, you're not going to be as successful with women as you could be.  

When it comes to dating and relationships, it's important for you to focus on improving themselves instead of impressing women. After all, you can't have a healthy and lasting relationship if you're not taking care of yourself first.  There are a number of ways you can work on improving themselves, both physically and mentally. 

Here are a few areas you should focus on:  

 1. Physical fitness. Women are attracted to men who are in good shape. Hit the gym and get in shape. Not only will you look better, but you'll also feel better and have more energy.  

2. Your career. Women are attracted to men who are successful in their careers. If you're not happy with your current job, start working towards a promotion or finding a new job that you're passionate about.  

3. Your hobbies and interests. Women are attracted to men who have hobbies and interests that they're passionate about. Find something you're passionate about and start pursuing it.  

4. Your social life. Women are attracted to men who have an active social life. Make an effort to get out there and meet new people. Join clubs, attend social events, and just generally put yourself out there.  

5. Your sense of style. Women are attracted to men who take pride in their appearance and have a good sense of style. If you don't have much fashion sense, start by doing some research and then slowly start incorporating better style into your life. 

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what areas you want to focus on improving. But remember, the goal should be to make yourself the best you can be, not just to impress women. If you're happy and confident in yourself, that's what will ultimately attract the right partner into your life. Here are a few ways that you can work on improving yourself:  

1. Set goals and work towards them.  It's important to have something to strive for in life. Otherwise, you'll just end up feeling aimless and lost. Figure out what you want to achieve, and then put in the hard work to make it happen.  

2. Be confident.  Confidence is key in any area of life. If you're not confident in yourself, it'll be difficult to achieve anything. Start working on building up your self-esteem, and you'll see everything else start to fall into place.  

3. Be independent.  Don't rely on anyone else to make you happy. Learn to be content with your own company, and you'll find that you're much happier and more fulfilled. 

 4. Be honest.  With yourself and with others. Honesty is the cornerstone of any good relationship. If you can't be honest with yourself, you'll never be able to be honest with anyone else.  

5. Challenge yourself.  Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. It's only by pushing yourself that you'll grow and learn. 

Embrace new challenges and see them as an opportunity to learn and grow.  These are just a few ideas to get you started. Improving yourself is a journey, not a destination. So start today, and see where it takes you.",1655717870.0
70,Women Use Love To Soften Men Up,246,vg1wda,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vg1wda/women_use_love_to_soften_men_up/,66,"Too many men have met their demise in the name of love.  From suicide to getting killed to going to prison, men have been softened up because they fell in love with a woman.

A man should not fall in love, but he should be loving to his women.

Fall in love: Your emotions take over when you love a woman

Be loving: treat the woman in the manner of a man who loves a woman without letting his emotions take over.

I remember listening to an old Alan Roger Currie Blogtalk podcast where he said (and I paraphrase) that women will throw the word ""love"" out to any man, but be more selective with the men they sleep with, whereas men will be selective to tell a woman they love them, but have sex with any woman.  In my opinion, women will use ""love"" to soften a man up.  When a man loves a woman, he's more generous, more protective, and more hesitant to take actions needed (like punish bad behavior).

There are women who manipulate men with love.  This is why it's very important that you value cooperation over love.  You could fall in love with an unruly bitch and she has you wrapped around her finger.  This woman could break things off with you and your life would be over.  When a woman is cooperative and values you, she doesn't need to tell you she loves you... she shows it with her actions.  Value her submission than her telling you she loves you.

Women love bomb men to get what they want.  This means a committed relationship, a marriage, and a family.  If you dissect many relationships, the man and the woman in the relationship should have never went past fuck buddy status.

The thing is, these women are getting their “beta bucks” needs met through their clients aren’t they?  So when it comes to their LTR’s are they with alpha men or are they still with beta bucks there too? 

Would alpha men actually be okay with being in a LTR or having a kid with a stripper or escort. 
Theres one single mom stripper for instance who had a kid with her second babydaddy

What does TRP say about fucking escorts or strippers for cash in general?  It seems like it could be considered beta bucks, yet at the same time there seem to be a lot of nba players, actors celebrities etc who are fucking pornstars or high level instagram model escorts.

Usually, you’d have to pay $1000+ an hour to bang a famous pornstar or instagram model.  Do these celebrity guys do it in order to save time and avoid drama with women? Cause they could technically go anywhere in public and have thousands of hot girls willing to fuck them for free. Girls who’d likely be just as hot or hotter than the escorts or pornstars. 

There are older men doing this strategy, picking up waitresses, college girls at bars, and strippers and escorts and giving them cash to fuck. Usually $200+ for an hour up to $1000 for famous ig models or pornstars.",1655675028.0

We hooked up on the first night and started seeing each other off and on for a while. No exaggeration, we had almost everything in common: our musical tastes, the food we liked, our (dark) sense of humor... everything. (It was actually borderline absurd how many parallels there were.) Now a blue-pilled mind might start thinking, ""soulmate."" I was however at a point in my life (still am), where I was not interested in pairing off, for various reasons, no matter how uncanny our relationship kept becoming, I refused to commit. I even let her know from the very beginning I'd be ending this at some point. We were just having fun, no big deal. It got to the point that despite the fact we didn't have an exclusive relationship, we were acting like a swinging monogamous couple, minus any titles. (I never ONCE allowed her to call me her boyfriend and I never once called her my girlfriend.) To be honest, I've never me a woman before or after that could \*play\* with me the way she could. Our playtime, not just in the bedroom, was awesome. If I had been of a monogamous mindset, I might have tried to choose her to pair-bond back then. It was only my cultivated mindset that kept me away from commitment.

This pseudo-relationship went on for years, honestly. We'd bang someone else and then come back to each other and talk about how insane most men and women are. I thought our relationship would end sooner than it actually did, but I wound up staying in Colorado longer than I expected, so we spent 4 years seeing each other... and she fell MADLY in love with me. I grew very, very fond of her, too, but she told me she would have stayed with me for life, and she couldn't help herself. She knew I wasn't hers, and that just made her want me even more.

At that time, I truly did feel bad for what I considered was ""leading her on"" but the truth is I was always honest with her. ""I like you. You're fun. I like the way I feel when you're around. But I'll be leaving someday. I know we're not the right one for each other for life."" However I NOW see that I was working crazy dread-game on her without even realizing it. By placing her in an impossible situation where she could never have my heart permanently, (I told her it was elsewhere), she must have internalized my value as a mate being off the charts, and couldn't help herself. I always gave her the choice to leave, and she never did. This created a spiral of me liking her more and more even though I still knew I'd end it someday, and she responded to this incredibly well as far as her feelings for me went as she was constantly experiencing a plethora of both positive and negative emotions about our relationship without being able to blame me for any mistakes I made.

I also remember really internalizing red-pill only months before our relationship ended and changing the way I approached sex with her, acting like I was entitled to it and she didn't really much of a say about it.

I've never seen her more wet in my life. Fucked with my mind hard, but it is what it is.

I honestly had no intention to create dread game, I just didn't care. I was just being honest about where I was. It is actually quite disturbing to me, in retrospect, to realize that I had allowed my self to fall head over heels with her and give my heart to her fully, she may not have fallen for me the way she did at all.",1655504426.0

When it all started, he was in her lower 30's. Married to a great man for about a year who had everything on paper. About 6'4"", solid build, high earner ($200K+), confident, loyal and all all around genuinely nice guy. The ""every woman's dream"" type of guy you'd think. Even his family (her in-laws) were the model in-laws who adored her and were very generous to her. 

A year into their marriage, she started interviewing for a career change and fell hard for her future boss, we'll call him Chad, at the very first interview. They had lots of chemistry and to her, ""there was no stopping"" what would eventually happen. Over the next 2 years she regularly cheated on her loyal husband with Chad. When she met Chad, he was in a LTR with a woman who he was known to regularly cheat on. When they eventually got caught, he broke it off fairly easily with his LTR (no kids, no marriage) and she turned her life upside down for Chad by divorcing her wonderful husband and splitting up their assets. 

She and Chad moved in together and Chad never made any promises of commitment, never publicly announced their relationship on social media, and invested himself into work. She also knew about his history of cheating prior to them getting together, but she continued on anyways because of tingles and feels and how what SHE felt was REAL love. 

Now, 4 years later, the relationship has inevitably grown stale for him and he's completely withdrawn. He's almost certainly fucking other women but she sadly ""believes him when he says he's not."" She's 40 years old. He's in his prime, even more-so than when they started seeing one another. And she is full of rage for ""turning her life upside down for him"" and her ex husband is remarried to a young blonde with kids on the way. Since this woman is a close friend, it hurts to watch her go through this. But she blames things on him - ""he's taken everything from me"", ""he's so selfish"" and it's tough for me to have sympathy for her. They're still living together and she continues to cook him meals and do his laundry, hoping that the feelings will return because she is convinced he is the one and true love of her life.

I dated and slept with a variety of different women, not a ton like some of you but enough to feel like I got most of what I wanted from this. I grew tired of gaming chicks, tired of putting on the show. Quit thinking about the game to focus on things I cared about, things not involving girls. I figured since I had shed my insecurities and nice guy tendencies I could just live my fun life, quit playing games, and still get some girls here and there, being my authentic self.

Nope. Now they ghost, flake, or offer to be friends, lol. I'm kinda torn here, I could go back to doing what has worked, but I'm not really feeling that, being cocky and mysterious isn't really me. I could just be my new and improved confident self, and accept the fact I will get less women, and the ones that do work out would probably be a better fit for me.

Age: 28

Race: Eastern Asian

Height: 5'7

Location: Las Vegas  


**Preface:** This field reports gonna contain alot of adventures. From stealing a girl from her sugar daddy, to making out with her best friend, to trying to do a threesome, to nuking my own set because I went for the high risk play.   


It was another weekend of raging. Lately, I feel like I've just been partying more than running game but that's only because my wings keep having guests in town. My roommate M had some friends in town so I went out with them. They got a table at the club and I was pulling girls to the table. My roommate M pulled these two white girls to the table, let's call them Ashley and Jessica. Both were 21yos and quite hot. Ashley was hotter. Like a 8/10 with a banging body.   


**Set:**  
1. I came back to the table after bringing some girls back and I see Ashley and Jessica sitting at the booth so I sat next to Ashley and opened with a push pull statement. The set immediately hooks. We chat for like 30 seconds and I'm physically escalating on her simultaneously. I calibrated that she was down based on how well the physical escalation was going and go in for the make out. We're now intensely making out within 60 seconds. Turns out she has a huge thing for asian guys.   


Her bestfriend, Jessica, was sitting right next to her and I was like shit I need someone to wing me. So I tried to ""whisper"" to other guys at the table to wing me on her friend. Essentially, none of them were able to wing me but it wasn't their fault. Turns out, Jessica has a thing for black guys and there weren't any black guys around. So I redirected my focus on Ashley. We're making out even more. She proceeds to straddle me and things are getting pretty inappropriate. Like imagine a packed table of people just talking to each other and then in the middle, there's this girl straddling a guy and making out intensely lmao.   


Anyways, I'm like okay it's time to pull. I tell Ashely let's go grab a drink somewhere else less loud. She agrees. I pulled her out of the table. Her friend Jessica comes with us. I'm like fuck. How the fuck am I gonna manage this? But it's whatever, there's a 0% chance of us having sex at the club. At least if I pulled both girls back to my place, there might be a 5% chance.   


I take the girls outside of the club and this is where I find out Jessica has a thing for black dudes so I'm HUNTING. I tried to introduce her to two different black guys but it didn't work out and I'm like whatever I can't deal with this right now, I got to focus on Ashley. All 3 of us sat down at the slot machines and this is where God gave me a freebie. Jessica said she has to go to the restroom so she went. We waited for her for like 15 minutes and she wasn't coming back. Ashley tried calling and texting multiple times. Nothing. So Ashley was like ""fuck it, let's just go, she probably met some dude"". Im like SWEET. fuck yeah lets bounce.   


I take her back to my place and yall know how it goes ;) So afterwards, we were chatting a bit more and it turns out she's here with her sugar daddy LOL. I did not fucking know. Nor would I have gave a fuck lmao. Apparently he funded the trip and he was at the club too. Anyways, the next day, I dropped her off because he had a pool party to go to.   


After her pool party, she calls me to pick her up and I'm like ok. I pick her up and she's with Jessica and I'm like okay wtf is this. I have another night of turning up so I'm not really trying to hang out, I wanted to take a nap if anything. I brought them to my place so now I'm thinking.... ""ok are we about to have a threesome, and if so how do I play this?"" lmao. Ashley was tipsy and clearly down to fuck. Jessica went to the balcony to smoke a joint. I'm making out with Ashley and getting pretty sexual so I bring her to my room. I could have just fucked her there but... I wanted to try to do a threesome. So I told Ashley, I'mma check up on Jessica.   


I left the room and went to the balcony. I'm now chatting and flirting with Jessica. I escalate verbally but just asking her if she's ever had sex on a balcony before. Eventually, we go back into the living room and I did hand of god and pulled her closer to me. Now we're making out. We're getting pretty sexual. I'm fingering her and such. Then she's asks me something along the lines of ""uhh what about Ashley?"". Tbh, idk what I responded with. Jessica proceeds to go into my room and lays on the bed with Ashley whos sleeping by now. Jessica said she's tired and she's gonna take a nap too. And that was it lmao. Sorry boys, very anti climatic. The threesome did not happen.   


They napped for like an hour and then I dropped them off at their hotel. A few hours later, I get a call from Ashley and she asked ""so did you try to fuck my friend?"". LOL. I was like.... uhhhhh........... yes. And this is how I nuked my own set.   


**Key Take Aways:** 

1. Game > Money: I think this set was an excellent example that money BY ITSELF is not enough to attract women. Don't get me wrong. I'm not advocating for yall to be broke. But if you're using money to attract women, you'll always lose to guys who can genuinely attract women. 
2. If you cant pull her by herself, then pull everybody: I couldn't pull Ashley by herself but does that mean I just give up on the set? Fuck no. This happens all the time. Girls cant get separate blah blah blah. The point is, there's a 0% chance of you sleeping with her at the club/bar/mall/whatever, so pull the whole group and maybe you'll have a 5% chance at your place. 
3. Quit your self limiting beliefs: I would have never hooked up with Ashley if I had self limiting beliefs such as white girls aren't into asian guys. Or I'm not tall enough to hit on her. Etc. 
4. Risk it for the biscuit: Stop playing life so safe. Fortune favors the bold and you need to take risk. Either that's asking your classmate out on a date or trying to bang her best friend in hopes of it turning into a threesome. Like what was I suppose to do? I had to go for the threesome lmao. It didn't work out and completely nuked my set but whatever. Live and learn gents.",1655218784.0
77,Don’t ask a fish how to catch a fish. Don’t ask a bear why he wants to eat a fish.,168,vbp5su,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vbp5su/dont_ask_a_fish_how_to_catch_a_fish_dont_ask_a/,30,"Do you know what makes you initially attracted to women? 

Can you actually explain it? 

“Why yes sir, her nose is approximately 5 centimeters left of her eyes which protrude at an even level not more than 3 inches a part, producing a beautiful face which makes me want to stick my meat pole inside it.”

Or maybe you are not as sophisticated

“She got big titties man, and a nice ass. She fine.” 

When you see a girl you’re attracted to, you just are. No dude is out here rationalizing why he is attracted to a girl the same way no girl is rationalizing why she is attracted to a dude. 

The advice “don’t ask a girl how to get girls” is often frowned upon in places not like the red-pill. It’s misogynistic, sexist, blah blah blah. 

“Are you saying a girl can’t give good advice?”

No. They just don’t give good advice on what makes men attractive to them. They don’t know why. They just are. 

What makes a man attractive and a woman attractive obviously differ. A woman for her beauty, attitude, and certain “household” skills and a man for what he can do for/to the girl. 

If a girl asked you what she could do to be more attractive to a man and her face looked like it was ran over by a semi-truck, what would you say? 

Maybe go to the gym and build a nice body, but that’s pretty obvious. If you were on the street and you saw the woman in question, you would look at her and think nothing of her sexually, because you’re not attracted to her. 

You don’t know why, ok maybe you do, she’s ugly. But you don’t know *why* her being “ugly” isn’t attractive to you. You can probably look inward and think about it. “Her nose is too far away from her eyes” or “she’s too skinny.” 

But in your day to day, as you see women (if you see women) you aren’t thinking about the curvature of her face or how the alignment of her eyes makes it look like she’s from the goonies, which turns you off. You simply aren’t attracted. Next girl please.

Girls aren’t thinking about this doubly so because of their dependency on their feelings and they don’t think rationally a lot of the time.

This is why you can’t take advice from women on how to get women the same way women can’t take advice from men to make them more initially desirable to men, neither party will be able to explain it without getting weirdly technical. 

A girl isn’t going to tell a man that she wants a man who cannot be controlled, who can physically and mentally dominate her. She might not even know she wants that or why (they usually don’t). She’s going to say something like “he needs to be confident, nice, patient, and have a good personality” because it’s what she thinks she wants. 

The same way a man isn’t going to tell a girl, “I want a girl whose eyes are 15 centimeters from the base of her head with her legs congruent to her hip ratio in an hourglass fashion, firm c cups and luscious lips, get plastic surgery.” Most of us just want them to be hawt, at least for the first fuck. We don’t give a shit how it happens, make it happen bitches!

Obviously relationships are a different story, but as for what makes us initially attracted to women, we’re as clueless as women are about men.

In some myths he has an emotional or mental battle with the woman, sometimes he has sex with her, and sometimes he does both. As a result of the encounter the man becomes civilized, leaves his animalistic, childlike ways behind, and begins to focus on improving himself by seeking knowledge, collecting resources by working, and conquering other men. Examples of these myths include the Epic of Gilgamesh and the story of Adam and Eve in the Bible. 

In the Epic of Gilgamesh, which is the oldest serious literature known to humankind, the people of Uruk beg the gods to save them from their king, Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh is Chad, the perfect, archetypal alpha male. Being 2/3 god himself, he exhausts and defeats all other men in games and has sex with all the beautiful women in the land. In fact, Gilgamesh particularly likes to fuck women before their husband the night of their wedding. Nobody can defeat him, and all obey and live in fear of him. 

To save the people of Uruk, the gods create an exact copy of Gilgamesh named Enkidu to defeat and kill Gilgamesh. But Enkidu has no desire to fight Gilgamesh. In fact, Enkidu has no desire for the trappings of civilization of like money, glory, or even good food. Enkidu even runs away with the other animals when he sees a human, even though he was built to be as powerful and intimidating as Gilgamesh. 

To force Enkidu to live up to his potential and focus on his mission of defeating Gilgamesh, the gods send Enkidu a prostitute named Shamhat, who has wild, crazy sex with Enkidu for a week. After this week of passion, Enkidu falls in love with Shamhat and agrees to go the city with her, where she civilizes him by making him dress, eat, and act like a human. More importantly, Shamhat convinces Enkidu to go fight Gilgamesh by telling him she would rather fuck Gilgamesh. Like a good white knight beta male, Enkidu goes to stop Gilgamesh from fucking a woman the night of her wedding. Enkidu loses the battle, but he and Gilgamesh become friends and travel the world defeating monsters for fame.  

The gods then decide to kill Enkidu. Upon learning that he will die, Enkidu starts crying like a little bitch. He regrets the encounter with Shamhat, curses her, and wishes that could have stayed an animalistic child in the wilderness. But the gods tell Enkidu that encountering the prostitute was necessary for his development as a man. He takes back all the mean things he said about her. 

The crazy thing about the Epic of Gilgamesh is that Enkidu is literally Chad. He was created as an exact copy of the perfect, archetypal alpha male. But it was only after he got some pussy that he wanted to seek status, conquer men, and become a hero. But the encounter with the woman also domesticated him, civilized him, sapped him of his vigor, which made him fail in his mission of defeating Gilgamesh. There was no reason for Enkidu to lose to Gilgamesh other than his own mind. The challenge, therefore, is to use women for motivation, but not to be trapped by them. 

Why do may cultures have a myth where a man becomes civilized after encountering a woman? What are these myths trying to teach? Maybe they are trying to teach that men are by nature free-spirited and desire to wander the unknown; and that women are constantly trying to domesticate, feminize, and control men. Maybe these myths are trying to teach that women are man’s greatest challenge and desire, so mens’ primary motivation in self-improvement is to impress women. Or maybe these myths are trying to teach that men can only live peacefully in society after they learn empathy, compassion, and self-control from dealing with women. Whatever the lesson, the basic message is the same: a man is not a man until he struggles with a woman.

Unfortunately in modern society most men are failing in their encounters with women. Statistics show that fewer men are having sex and every few weeks an “incel” does a mass shooting somewhere. An army of weird nerds now live on the internet all day, crying about how terrible women are and how unfair the world is, and whining about the fact they are not Chad. Like Enkidu, they regret encountering women and wish to retreat back to a childlike state where they can just play video games, watch internet porn, and curse women like Enkidu cursed Shamhat. Like Enkidu, these men had the potential to be Chad and defeat the alpha male, but they lost one battle and gave up. 

But the myths make one thing very clear: once you leave the childlike state, you can not easily return. God puts a flaming sword at the entrance of the Garden of Eden, and the Sumerian gods make clear to Enkidu he can not go back to living with the animals. Nor do the gods want you to go back: the gods created you to be a world conqueror who gathers knowledge, builds civilizations, and has relationships with women. In fact, the whole reason the gods arranges the encounter with the woman was to strengthen you for your mission as a world conqueror.  

At the same time, the myths include another important message: a man can and should return to this free-spirited, childlike state, not by retreating from women and civilization, but rather by conquering and overcoming it. Women are most attracted to men in the free-spirited, wild state, but womens’ desire to control, domesticate, and “shit test” men destroys the very thing women liked about men in the first place. And while in every myth the man fails the test the first time, he can still be redeemed later. After the destruction of Zion, the Bible talks about how God will restore it to be better than the Garden of Eden. And in the Epic of Gilgamesh, after the death of Enkidu Gilgamesh honors his fallen friend by going into the wilderness and living with the animals again – but this time, not as a naïve child, but as the alpha male. 

A few years ago, an anonymous poster on the internet message board SoSuave.com named Pook made a bunch of posts about how the best way to build attraction with women is to return to your childlike state, back before you first encountered women. Quoting another poster named Anti-Dump, he said “You should be free as a bird, flapping around, singing, full of joy with life. Women want to catch the bird and throw it in a cage.” But, Pook points, out “who wants a bird that WANTS to be in the cage? No, women want the birds that are FREE, WILD, and BEAUTIFUL. They want A GOOD CATCH. Good Catches do not fly into cages. Only wounded or needy birds do.”  

You must therefore succeed in your encounters with women by returning to that original state where you were free as a bird, singing, and full of joy and life.

79,Trust The Numbers Game,97,vb8erh,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vb8erh/trust_the_numbers_game/,68,"From some of the comments I get, there are a bunch of non-believers that the number game will work for them.  Some will say that they've approached hundreds of women and still  no luck.  Unless you track it, you are only guessing.

When you first cold approach women, you will get rejected a lot because you're new to it and radiate a lot of nervous energy.  You will approach women who have boyfriends/husbands.  You will approach women who may have funky attitudes (fortunately, most women aren't rude and disrespectful when you yourself are respectful to them).  The numbers game is all about sifting through the women who are not available, non-cooperative, or just flat out wrong for you, to get to the women who are compatible and highly cooperative to you.

A good way to stick it out playing the numbers game is this:

The first 7-10 approaches will get you comfortable approaching women.  You will notice that you're not feeling as nervous as you did approaching the first woman.  From this point on, you will notice that you're pushing your comfort zones when interacting with women.

Treat each interaction like practice.  The goal is to feel within your element approaching women.  You will notice that by adopting this mindset, you're getting bolder, more solid, and more confident with women.

You will have a moment where you're shopping and you spot a sexy woman with an amazing body.  You approach her without hesitation (cold approaching a lot of women trains your brain to behave in this manner).  You talk to her and ask her for her number.  She gives it to you, you call her, and it's not a fake number.  You set a date, but the girl flakes.

Don't worry about situations like these.  This just means you're getting close to your goal.  You will start to notice that you're getting more numbers than you have previously.  Trust the numbers game.

One day you might have to get an oil change.  A cute chick with a nice pair of legs needs to get an oil change too.  You talk to her for the duration of the oil change.  Before the both of you leave, you exchange numbers.  You set a date, she accepts and arrives, and the both of you have sex at some point.  It may not be the first day, but possibly the second or third in-person interaction.

For some men, it may take 20 approaches to get laid.  For some men, it may take 200 approaches to get laid.  The trick is to not think about getting laid, but to tighten up your game.  Focus on the numbers because guess what?  After you get laid, you're gonna go right back out there to continue playing the numbers game.

If you get a girlfriend or wife, I highly suggest continue cold approaching women just to stay sharp with your game (you're not cold approaching to get laid, you're cold approaching to not get rusty).  Relationships don't always last and this is why you need to stay sharp so you will be able to continue getting women and it won't feel like you're starting all over again.

80,"Don’t Worry, You’re Making Progress (Bad Days are Ok.)",167,vaf4ra,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vaf4ra/dont_worry_youre_making_progress_bad_days_are_ok/,12,"If there’s one thing us guys are good at – particularly those of us into self-improvement – it’s beating ourselves up and being a self-tyrant. We place these crazy unrealistic expectations upon our own heads, expecting daily perfection, never allowing for any misteps or mistakes anywhere along the way.  
You’ve gotta be realistic in your expectations of yourself – you’re a human, a human who’s going to make a million mistakes throughout your life… no matter how hard you try not to. The measuring stick you should be using is: if you’re making progress – ANY amount of progress – you’re on track. The journey of a thousand miles is measured in individual steps – not giant leaps. In other words, **simple daily habits consistently repeated over time, rather than huge leaps which require you to muster up all your willpower and motivation (which are always followed by a dropoff in motivation and then days/weeks of laziness & lack of progress).** Think *The Tortoise and the Hare*.  
This is the method I’ve used to achieve pretty much all of my goals – slow and steady progress over time.

A mate of mine was recently beating himself up, because he had a day where he only talked to 5 girls. He was really down on himself, because the previous day he’d talked to 15 girls, and felt like he was “going backwards”.  
But 2 weeks ago my homie wasn’t talking to ANY girls – now on his *worst* day he talks to 5 girls. He’s also much more self-aware, more confident, is working on his dating skills, is building a habit of going to the gym, and is tackling his challenges head-on like a man. He feels more alive. His worst day now is a million times better than his worst day from 2 weeks ago, let alone 2 months or 2 years ago.  


## Measure Progress Over a Longer Timescale

Don’t get caught up in comparing each and every single day to your previous day – take a step back, zoom out a bit and look at the general trend over time. Are you, generally speaking, happier and making more progress than you were a few months ago? Good, you’re on the right path. Your only goal should be to have a *general upwards trend over time*. You need to compare your *average* days to your past average days, and then see if you’re gradually improving over time.  
Example time: Let’s say 6 months ago you spent most days jerking off to porn, eating too much junk food, not talking to any girls, and not going to the gym. These days, you go to the gym a few times a week, you’ve cut down on the porn (though sometimes you relapse), you count your calories and don’t eat as much junk food, and you’re messaging a couple girls a week on online dating sites. Congratulations! Your average day now looks a *hell* of a lot better than it did 6 months ago.  


## Comparing Your Best…

You can also compare your *best* days to your past best days, and see if there’s a general improvement over time. Maybe 6 months ago your best day meant you went to the gym and messed around for 30 minutes, talked to 3 girls on *Tinder*, met up with some mates and smoked weed with them all night. A pretty decent day.  
But the last few weeks, your best day looks more like this: You go to the gym and absolutely crush your routine, putting more weight on the bar than you did the previous workout. You leave feeling amazing, strong, fucking *powerful*. You message 10 girls online, and even manage to work up the courage to talk to a random girl you see on the street during your lunch break. You listen to self-development podcasts on your commute to and from work, put in a very solid work day (other people are starting to notice & comment on your improved work ethic), and grab dinner with some mates, talking about your goals and latest achievements.  
Clearly a *much* better “best day” than your best day from 6 months ago. Congrats! You’re improving over time.  


## …And Comparing Your Worst.

And if you must compare your worst days and be a tyrannical cunt to yourself, fine. But at least be realistic in your comparisons. If you have a shit day now – like my client “only” talking to 5 girls instead of 15 – compare it to your shittiest day from 6 months ago. I’ll bet you 10 bucks that 6 or 12 months ago your worst day was the stuff of nightmares. **At the time, I bet you’d have given anything to have a day like the “bad” days you have now.**  
The *number* of bad days vs good days is also important. If a year ago 3 out of every 7 days were bad days – and now you only have a bad day once a week – that’s massive progress. It’s proof you’re on the right path, proof you’re doing the right things. Keep on going, and **don’t ever quit.**  
Another thing people do is compare their progress to other people’s progress. The issue with that is one of transparency – you’re acutely aware of *all* of your flaws and mistakes, but you don’t see even one-tenth of the mistakes the other person makes. You’re only seeing a *highlight reel* of their life – the parts they’ve chosen to show you. You have no idea what’s going on in their head – their fears, insecurities and doubts are all hidden from you.  
You look at them and think, “Damn, they make it look so easy. Meanwhile I’m here being such a fuckup”. Truth is they’re *exactly* like you, *and they’re not special.* They’re not immune from all the bullshit you’ve had to struggle with. Every person you look up to, every person you compare yourself to, had a million bad days where they were on the edge of despair. And chances are on their bad days, those people were beating themselves up, just like you are right now.  


## The Takeaway

Be more objective in how you judge your progress. Are your generally improving over time? Great, keep doing what you’re doing – and don’t stress about the occasional bad days. If you’re not improving over time – then make some changes, adjust your approach and try again.  
If you’re stressing about making up for lost time, or feel time is slipping away from you, remember [age doesn’t matter](https://killyourinnerloser.com/age-doesnt-matter). Just focus on making a little progress each day – one teensy tiny little baby step – and over time your success will snowball. **As long as you** ***never*** **quit, you’ll eventually get there.**  
Be nicer to yourself; **this self-improvement journey is supposed to be enjoyable**. Don’t beat yourself up if you have a bad day. Just focus on incremental improvements, and as long as you’re doing the right things, you’ll be on that upwards trend line.",1655011739.0
81,My parents red pill marriage-,157,v9t3zf,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v9t3zf/my_parents_red_pill_marriage/,31,"
I needed a place to write all this down so I’m sorry in advance if it’s hard to read, I’ll do my best to edit if interest arises.

I embraced red pill a few years ago and it worked well with everything I wanted. I am a 22 year old dude who’s trying to figure out what I like and the type of woman I would like later in life to have my kids with. So I’m trying to spin plates like most of you. I never realized how this red pill theory can actually work in a successful and happy marriage because I kept trying to compare my dad with me and how I do things. After a lot of introspection I realized that it’s not just about spinning plates, maintaining frame, taking responsibility when in need, but it’s about being a good leader and like great leaders they approve of you only in matters where you truly deserve an approval. 

My parents have been married for 30 years and I’ve been trying to figure out how the fuck they did it. This is not a one that you stumble on everyday, this is a relationship that is strong, passionate, and always growing. (My parents are in their late 50s and still have sex[I know this Bc I walked in on them about 6 months ago]). 

What I never realized is that my dad is a fucking brick wall, works a 9-5 to support our family no other reason, he takes sacrifices, pursued his dream by becoming a political refugee and escaping communism in the late 80s and is now living his American dream. He is unemotional to an extent, he barely gives my mom validation. (He doesn’t do this on purpose he’s just a stern man that comes from a family where his parents never showed any type of emotion to him). But when that validation comes whether that’s a hug, flowers, or some gifts once in a while it means a lot to her. This got me thinking about validation progressive overload with a plateau. You tell a woman you love her in the first month of dating what next? Okay you propose, next? Okay marry!? What’s after that. Woman get bored and are always looking for the next dose of validation but if that validation is the same for years it loses meaning. Supply and demand baby. Let those words actually mean something by Using them only when you need them and in scarcity. Just like diamonds are rare and expensive and sought after and I love you from your close partner will mean a lot if it’s rare and only when it’s truly meant. And look I’m not saying this approach is perfect, my mom is always complaining about My dad never telling her she looks nice or never telling her that he loves her. (“Never” is not true just extremely rare). But it’s a blessing in disguise because I believe if my dad was a man of ample validation their relationship would look different. Also I should mention that my dad does validate her by helping her with concerts that she puts up, spending hours and hours helping her prepare and so in hindsight that is a sort of validation because of the hours that he puts in helping her achieve her own goal. 

My mom works as his teammate, contributing to the relationship as a caregiver but also a smart intellectual that actually got my dad to read a lot, go to concerts, plays and watch movies. She made him a better man in exchange for him giving the motor and direction for the beautiful life they live now. 


TL DR
So how do you do it?

Don’t give in to Americans society bullshit of validating her(your loved one) with your words everyday. Do it when you mean it. Find other ways to stimulate her and keep wanting your approval. 

The greatest thing about all this is that my dad doesn’t even think about what he does, but the way he does things is the recipe to a successful and loving relationship.",1654935909.0

&#x200B;

I was waist deep in a 3 year relationship at that time. The pill taught me so much. It taught me how to not react, how to have discipline and self respect.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the end of the relationship, I pulled the plug and started my new journey of being a RedPilled single man. 

&#x200B;

I smashed. I conquered. I ploughed through the many wastelands of 5s,6s and 7s with God sent blessings from the occasional 8s, 9s and even 10s.

&#x200B;

Revolutionary. 

&#x200B;

I tried to convert the men who needed it around me. But I was seen as a lunatic. They didn’t want to hear any of it.

&#x200B;

It's how I first learnt the truth about love. Not the love you feel for family or close ones. It's a kind of love that's different. It's the love that involves sex.

  
The relationships I got in after being RedPilled and single, taught me so much.  
After a long time of seeing multiples of 2 or 3 plates during a period, I would proceed to spend more time than needed on 1 of them. Obviously because I enjoyed their company.

  
One of these decided to push exclusivity.  
I decided to agree. 4 months down the line she gets too passive aggressive for my likening, I tell her I'll leave her if she doesn't stop. Then I see her act up again.

I end it.

She's devastated. I move on quick and get more plates/respin old ones.   
Months go by and I barely hear from her. Suddenly she meets up with me, we have fun, she's well behaved. We then go back to her place and smash, with DEMOTED plate status contract accepted. Fuck yeah.  


Fast forward 2 years to next relationship.  
Same thing as before, the same proceedings but this time - I feel something is off.

She starts subtly asking for money, her tenant won't pay, she wants this, that etc etc. I never give her a penny. And I notice how she gives me sex and oral whenever I want.. However, she fakes her orgasms.  
It was a performance. All for me.

She even purposely left birth control pills around. I never took the bait thank God.  


This tripped me out.  


I couldn't believe I was fooled.  
But 1 year down the line, I meet another woman. I fall for the feelings, again.  
This time, she doesn't subtly hint for money. She offers to split everything, sometimes even paying.   
A few WEEKS into the agreement I see messages from another man she was involved with (intuition told me to gtfo but was too puss), I tell her to stop and that I will leave if it happens again. She proceeds to block him everywhere, I don't ask for it.   
But low and behold, it happens again.   
So I get out.  
I had a realisation at the time, and that was that the sex she gave me was the same as the golddigger.  
Except she wasn't doing it for money or babies... She was doing it for emotion/comfort/validation.  
She was lonely, and I was the best choice for her to do stuff on the weekends with while she would get fucked by Chad when she had time to spare.  


The strangest part about this past one was that I finally didn't give a shit. I finally understood why they do it and how I cannot be angry at them, it's just how they are now. A long time ago when the provider/fighter (beta/alpha) balance was in harmony, I truly believe that things weren't nearly as bad as they are now.

  
It's something that we have to get used to, accept and learn to love - in the correct way.

tl;dr Don't get married. Fuck that.",1654798677.0
83,What is the matrix and how we can escape it: prologue,0,v9ea0p,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v9ea0p/what_is_the_matrix_and_how_we_can_escape_it/,26,"I have understood the matrix for a few months but I was struggling to articulate it in a coherent way which prevented me from laying it out in front of other individuals who are not afraid to think differently than the rest.

Fortunately, I succeeded today.

**About this post**: In this post, I have explained what created the matrix in a very(times hundred) simple way. I might have skipped quite a lot of connecting points but I have covered the gist. This post will (I hope) help you understand the matrix from a different perspective. A perspective that will help you act against it. 

**Warning:** This post might offend you.

As it is Friday evening here, I smoked a lotta weed. I was watching videos in which a dude was describing Hinduism as “people who are praying to elephants” in a derogatory way.

Instead of being offended, it was funny to me as I am a Hindu myself.

It was not that dude’s fault.

Most people, including Hindus themselves, are seeing Hinduism(and any sects thereof like Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, etc.) through the eyes of Christian colonizers.

Let me take you back to the 17th century. When the “new world” was being discovered.

## India that was Bharat

When they colonized India in the 17th century, their perspective was the same they propagated the same image by writing books that were taught in universities.

Indian universities (like Nalanda University) were all destroyed by Muslim invaders who have been at it since the 8th century. As a result, there was a lack of a voice for Hindus to describe and define their own identity.

They are defined as a country of savages, worshipping elephants, a country of snake charmers, and what have you. 

This is horribly wrong. Here is a very recent example that will help you understand my point.

They(the British colonizers) plundered the crap out of India. without India, the allies could not have won WWII. We gave soldiers, capital, food, everything. It all came from people, which resulted in a severe economic crisis and famine, that ended up killing almost 7 million people.

Hitler killed 6 million Jews.

Churchill killed more Indians than that at the same time. The only difference is that history is written by the victors.

The UK was buying guns and supplies from the US. How did the UK pay for all of that? Remember they are an island with zero natural resources. Insignificant when you compare that with the tropical fertile India which was rich asf with natural resources like steel, coal, aluminum, gold, etc.

If India was a country of savages, how did it help them not only fund but win and prosper after a global conflict like that?

They propagated a wrong image to justify their actions to the world. So, our identity was curated and spread by the individuals who committed countless war crimes in Bharat (the remnants of which are identified as India today). That included the enslavement of people, abasement of women and children, and ethnic cleansing.

In the eyes of the world, they ""educated"" us, they made us ""civilized"". That is the way the British East Indian company justified the expenses towards the missionaries to the Crown.

Since the 16th century, (until colonization) Bharat (India's name in that century) contributed 25% of the world's GDP.

Hindus are fucked today (but slowly rising) because of two reasons:

1. repeated invasions from the Islamic state since the 8th century haven't stopped until now. Hindus are still persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and many parts of India by Muslim aggressors. However, we cannot retaliate because mainstream media tells the world it is “islamophobia” and Muslims are being targeted as they are a minority. This is because it distorts the widely accepted lie: “Islam is the religion of peace”. Shias and Sunnis are still fighting, go figure.
2. The devastating impact of Christian (also known as the religion of love) colonization. Not only did it destroy our identity but also ruined our systems of governance, education, and everything so we are struggling to pull ourselves up.

Just FYI, if you want to see the most fucked up things Christians have done, look at all the countries that were formerly colonized: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the entire African subcontinent, South America, USA(colonizers managed to kill all the natives here), Canada(killed them all here too). All those countries are fucked.

The problem lies with the inherent design of religion. I have explained it below.

## Why religion is cancer

The point of a religion(or any kind of spiritual belief system) has one purpose:

* Acting as a guide to a person’s existential issues and offering a path to salvation.

The problem is religion only offers one path to salvation. Deviating from the path will put you on the receiving end of terrible punishments that simulate hell. The religious punishments of both Christian and Islamic sets of beliefs are extremely horrible. They have been out of practice for now, almost. Many Islamic countries, which are labeled as “third world” by global bodies such as the UN (again, we are viewing them through a Christian lens), still punish people like that.

(If it doesn’t make any sense now, please read till the end.)

That is the reason the religions have one book. Deviating from the book means “not pure and/or divine” and you must be hit with a stick or something so that you should be “back on the path” through rigorous punishment.

The path to salvation.

## The organization of religion

Some people at the top will be the “keepers of the faith” who will decide whether people are on their best behavior and are living according to the Book.

They also enforced with force.

Not only that, they forced it on people who were not of their faith through war, enslavement(=because they were savages which made it justified), abasement, ethnic cleaning, etc.

At the bottom, there was one flaw in the design.

There is one path. The one. Nothing else is correct. No other path to salvation. The protectors and enforcers should be respected, worshipped, and accepted no matter how morally corrupt they actually are.

This is fucked up because someone told you that you should live a certain way. If you resist, you will be considered the enemy of the church or the mosque. You are too dangerous as you are a sinner and you will be hunted down and punished severely.

Why?

Because a long time ago, someone claimed that God told him to do all of that. That someone is the “messenger of god”.

Follow the book, else die.

Live by the rules that someone else laid out for you, or face the brutal consequences.

You have no say on the rules.

Sounds familiar?

## The construction of the matrix

In the western countries or any country that is marked as “safe” by an organization of western countries (the UN), there is a constitution.

It is a book of rules to live by.

You don’t get to decide what rules go in there.

(please don’t tell me your vote matters, because it doesn’t. The corporations run the west, they just change faces through politicians. The proof is simple: the western world has gone bananas. Do you think people wanted this?)

The protectors and enforcers of the book are to be respected and cooperated with. No matter what. Otherwise, brutal consequences.

The same goes for all the indoctrination institutions like the school, colleges, etc., that don’t encourage free thinking by punishing disagreement with a present, prevalent belief even after presenting enough evidence.

Some people change some things in the book. But the foundations are the same as a religion.

One path to salvation.

## The counter-argument

“But women used to be virgins.”

Yes, yes, yes.

There were a lot of perks too.

At this point I will point out certain things, you decide whether the good is better or the bad:

1. It created the matrix today as we know it.
2. It enslaved most of the civilizations of the world. The list of countries was mentioned earlier in this article.
3. It started industrialization which ended up destroying the world. The people who decided the balance between sustainability and development were the protectors and enforcers of the book.
4. Colonialism led to imperialism, which led to consumerism. This is particularly the west. The colonizers eliminated the natives and ended up colonizing themselves.
5. Everything is a “product” in America. Because they are not people, they are users. They are to be interpreted via a metric called “customer engagement”. They are to be consumed.
6. Just like the UK justified consuming India. Just like the Spanish and the Portuguese consumed south America.
7. In the USA, everything is a product. Food is a product, engineered to stimulate your taste buds in a certain way that keeps you coming back even though it eventually kills you.
8. Healthcare, education, well-being, affection, everything is a product in the US.

And now they are fucked.

I will say that if there was any good(i don’t think there was because the plight of women was actually terrible under the realm of religion. Both Christianity and Islam tortured the hell out of women for a multitude of reasons that was justified by their respective books.)

## So, is there a solution

Yes. 

It is simple: accept multiple paths to salvation.

## Before you comment

1. I know that there must be a ton of questions that need answering. The most common one might be “how to implement the solution”. I appreciate that thought because we should all think about it. Unfortunately, I have only understood that answer halfway.
2. I will post that half slowly as it will help us dismantle the matrix in a safe way and not cause a complete social meltdown and plunge us all into the civil war.
3. Within the post also there are a lot of things that could have been explained with more clarity with proof (historical, factual, statistical, anthropological, anecdotal). I will do it in the upcoming posts.
4. This post was an extreme distillation of lots of knowledge I have accrued over the past couple of years.
5. If you think that I could be up to something here, please let me know.
6. This is a group of individuals who aren’t afraid to think. I think the above post is something that you haven’t thought of but is intriguing (I hope).
7. If that is not the case, I don’t think pursuing this avenue of thinking will be a good investment. I will not post any more posts if that becomes the reality.
8. Think of me as your younger, slower brother(if you are a guy, lmao. Ladies, I am currently single, lol.), and leave the snide out of your comments.
9. Again, I know I need to prove all of the above posts with solid proofs and I will because all of them exist. You can see them if you try. Providing proof is the first thing that I will do in my next posts.
10. Topics of my upcoming posts:
   1. Colonialism, types of colonialism, and the relationship between colonizer and the colonized.
   2. The difference between the Hindu Dharma and religion. 
   3. How the Hindus are different from the Abrahamic religions?
   4. Understanding the Hindu Dharma through a Hindu lens. (see b.)
   5. Why the Hindus are important in the context of escaping the matrix?
   6. How to escape the matrix by applying the Hindu philosophy?
   7. (suggest)

84,Scarcity Does Create Value,474,v71clb,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v71clb/scarcity_does_create_value/,90,"I'm 30, and I met this girl in a fitness class, absolute dime. She's 28, a latina, fitness freak, and an amazing figure (hard to put into words), really good looking girl.

I was a beta male for most of my life because I didn't know any better. Long story short I became fixated on this girl. Initially she was super into me, (sending me seductive snaps, long messages, would reply right away, etc). I made the mistake of always being available to her, offering her rides, offering her other shit, basically having blue balls as the gay male girlfriend.

Despite all of this weakness from me, she agreed to go out on a date. After the evening she texted me the next day saying she's looking for friendship only because she was coming off a relationship. I stupidly agreed hoping she would come around. Big mistake, because nice guys finish last. Never agree to a platonic friendship when you want more.

I would text her and would be left on read. I would reply to her IG stories and be left on read. One time I texted her asking if she wanted to go to the museum and she left me on read for a full week and then replied with ""Sorry I'm just seeing this now"". Yeah right, what a load of horseshit.

My friend recommended me to read the book ""The Way of a Superior Man"", and also started watching Corey Wayne on Youtube a bit, and I started to realize my big flaws. I immediately texted her saying I was no longer interested in a platonic friendship, and to reach out if your stance changes. I then disappeared completely. The guy that used to give her non stop advice, helped her move, would genuinely care about her, vanished from her a life for a while. I even stopped going to that fitness class to avoid seeing her and found another one.

I started seeing other women, started focusing more on my career. I'm talking to 3 different girls now I met off Hinge. I noticed she still always watched my IG stories living the good life and hanging out with friends. I wasn't fixated on her anymore.

Then about 6 weeks later, I was on a date with this other broad and she texted me asking how I'm doing. I looked at the text, and with a huge grin on my face, I put the phone back in my pocket and enjoyed my current date. When I got home after absolutely fucking this other girl's brains out, I looked at my phone and decided I'll reply the next day. Went to bed an absolute champ that night.

When I replied the next day mid morning she replied back almost instantly telling me how great it was to hear from me and she wanted to meet up for drinks. I kept it cool, cordial, but I didn't text her a lot, I just setup the time and date of when we were supposed to meet for drinks and ended the convo.

When we met up she was all over me. I can tell. The body language, the touching my arm, the eye contact, it was crystal clear. When we left the pub I kissed her in the parking lot. I drove to my apartment, and our clothes were off the minute we entered the living room. The best fuck I've ever had because I've been wanting to bang her for ages and her fit body with those womanly hips were pure bliss. This was 2 days ago.

Moral of the story: When you stop giving a shit and do your own thing, it creates attraction. Woman are attracted to men who's feelings are unclear. She was wondering about me which reignited the interest.",1654621136.0
85,Building Rapport is Bullshit,187,v4s61x,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v4s61x/building_rapport_is_bullshit/,92,"Now just like my last post, the spergs are going to take the title literally, but here we go.

The advice is simple. If you have never met a girl before in person it should not take you more than **3-4 text messages** to get her phone number from whatever OLD app or social media app you opened her on.

On OLD especially, texts should go something like this:

*Hey Alessia*

*Hey*

*What's your number*

*I'd have to get to know you better*

*No one fell in love over text / nothing important was ever written with thumbs / you can't really know someone until you look them in the eyes and feel their energy*

(xxx) - xxx - xxxx

&#x200B;

# Keep it dumb simple

If there isn't anything important to say, don't say it. By opening yourself up to rejection you polarize these girls that you should be screening for **high interest**. Either they say yes or no.

**If the girl has an ounce or two of interest she won't fumble the opportunity of getting with you just because of her pride.**

# Play the numbers game

The same goes with talking to girls in person. You want to **play the numbers** game and screen for high interest. If your SMV isn't very high naturally you will be pulling lower SMV girls (most of the time). However, when you play the numbers game you come to find out that **your SMV is extremely fluid and volatile** with varying types of women. I know some beautiful women who only go for dudes that are 300lb bouncers/security guards. Other girls just like ugly masculine guys‎. It's a matter of finding out for yourself, and you won't be able to do it by beating around the bush.

# Rapport ≠ interest

You probably have a false belief that you must build rapport to raise her interest. **This is not necessarily true**. By taking the direct approach you give off a high-status vibe and an unmatched **aura of confidence**, so although polarizing may weed out the *maybe* girls, it generally turns the **yes** girls into **FUCK YES** girls off the bat.

I have personally found that the approach that cuts the bullshit and gets straight to the point is absolutely the most efficient way to get to a yes or no and 5x more effective in not shooting yourself in the dick and saying something stupid. You have to read **Mode One by Alan Roger Currie** to understand what I'm talking about if you haven't experienced it yet.

It probably took me my first 50 or 100 cold approach rejections to really completely get over the idea that rejection matters at all, and people always ask me how I'm so confident in approaching girls. It's because I put in the work and **failed many more times than they have even tried**, and doing it quickly became second nature.

# Setting up the date

Now that you've gotten her number, you can text her her name back herself to alert her when she receives your text and even reminds her of how direct you are. This is what I like to do, as the name stays at the top of the messages and I can search their name in the iMessage search bar to find them without having to save their contact (I suggest never saving a girl's contact that you haven't fucked). Your next text should be along the lines of **""I'm taking you out for X at Ypm on Z day""**. She agrees and sends you her address, you pick her up and enjoy the rest of your night.

If you repeat this process even a dozen times you will have a feeling of mastery because you're **prepared for every situation** and possibility at this point. That's when you come to realize that **even outside** your little date protocol you can have the same confidence. That was the point when I truly left the matrix and realized how endless the possibilities are if you create those opportunities.

# What game really is

Remember, game comes after your intentions are already clear, and she knows you want to fuck her. This is the point when if she is interested she will start to shit test you. The only other time you will get shit tests from a girl without her knowing your intentions is when you're in a social circle setting and she wants to spike your interest without appearing too direct in front of other people.

# Embrace your masculine, sociable, cocky side

Tying it back to rapport. When you're ACTUALLY ON THE DATE you can go ahead and build a little bit of rapport, trust, and comfort like any **normal** person would have a **normal** conversation. Slowly you'll tweak your game and say **cockier, riskier things** and naturally be more sexual in your conversations. Girls honestly remember you by the first 30 minutes of what you did and how you acted on the first date, then later you can just coast and relax when you know they like you. This is the point when you apply heavier kino.

# Conclusion

**Rapport is not necessary for sexual attraction**. They just need enough (not a lot) to trust that you're not a weirdo and get some comfort to do what they really want to you. Most of the rapport I build is **after sex** because that's when it's actually needed. They don't want to regret fucking you, so give them comfort and cuddles after sex.

This was quite a long post, but let me know your thoughts and ideas because this is only my experience and I would love to hear what you guys have to say.",1654359347.0

*In a sub flooded by incels and cooks, there just might be a rising Chad or two. A rising slayer who’s gazing towards a fresh horizon of juicy pussy while breaking free of the chains of betahood. In a world filled with black pills, angry feminists, shit tests and cucks, he who muster the courage to take strides towards the path of adventure is who I write for. The brave young man who swallowed the red pill and dreaming of feasting with the Gods in Chadhalla.*

*As I absorbed and armed myself with the knowledge from the holiest of Side Bars and tread forward; I share to you, news from the front lines of the Pussy Wars.*

&#x200B;

\--

&#x200B;

I was visiting a new city for work and stayed over the weekend. so I fired up the ol’ slut trap and started swiping.

Matched with a Tinderella who looked nice and had just started studying here. We kept it short and sweet in the dm’s, scheduled a meet up the next day and it was off to the races.

We both got there 10min late and met up in the queue to get a table. She was way better looking in real life than in the pictures and I was taken aback. I thought *damn she is fine*, and in a classy way too. Not in the plastic thot kind of way, but more like the Dior/celebrity type. I actually felt my pulse rise, a girl hasn't made me feel like that in a while now.

&#x200B;

I tightened my shit up ‘cause ya boy is not a slave to his hindbrain, and we enjoyed some drinks outside in the sun. The conversation went alright, getting to know each other and joking around a bit. She was a rich girl from the capital city, ballet dancer and studied Russian. She was straight forward, clever and I would guess had rejected countless betas.

Conversation ebbed and flowed, and eventually the sun went down. Three hours had gone by at this point. We relocated to another restaurant for some more drinks and some snacks. It turned out to be a bit more fancy than I expected, but I played it cool and we got a table. 

*Note to self: Check out the places around before you go with a date there and have some options*. 

We were hungry and got food and a bottle of wine, stayed two more hours and talked, apparently I was her first tinder date ever. The bill got pretty high, but I enjoyed the food so whatever. Actually, she paid the bill, so welcome to my feminist utopia country.

&#x200B;

After dinner I was ready to pull her back to my hotel, but she was hesitant and wanted some more drinks. It was 10pm on a Saturday night so I said sure. We got to another place and started drinking. I was a bit buzzed at this point and the conversation got bad. We argued because she was a spoiled brat who basically lived in a bubble of rich people, and was very picky and entitled. We struggled a bit to understand each other since we are from different places so that didn't help. She was basically accusing me of being from low class peasant stock *(which in all honesty I am and I got offended)*. Shit tests was raining down on me like German artillery on Verdun.

I talked a bit of random shit and tried to steer the conversation back to something more fun and flirtatious. It did not work and it became awkward, which she explicitly did say. I was pretty sure it was game over at this point, but I pulled back and regrouped my game.

I caught myself acting like a bitch and recognized the shit test. I called the situation out and with all the amused mastery I could muster and said:   
\-*“Look, I know it turned sour now but damn, what did you expect. You are not supposed to be out on a first date for 8 hours. Of course it gets stale just sitting and talking for this long.”*   
We agreed and reckoned that the date in general had been quite good up to this point.

&#x200B;

We finished our drinks and headed out. A bunch of drunk shady guys stood in the street and she was looking fine. I grabbed her around the hips and steered her through the pack of hungry wolves so she knew I wasn't no scared beta bitch. I caught a cab and asked her if she wanted to come back with me. I didn't really think she wanted to because of the argument and the ride to my hotel was 20 minutes. She was hesitant, so I told her to jump in the cab and she actually did. We had a good time in the cab with some touching and laughter. 

When we got to the room it was on. I slapped her ass, choked her good and pulled her hair, which I enjoyed because of her behaviour earlier, she enjoyed it too and it was nice to release the tension. Fucked her again in the morning same thing, and off she went as a happy customer.

&#x200B;

*TD;LR: A date a bit out of the ordinary for me. It went from damn to good, to bad and then back to good. I sharpened my game and released myself from the defeatist mindset that she was out of my league. A challenge for sure, but she ended up face down biting pillow like a good girl.*",1654322427.0

So I have known that couple for years. They are swingers, but the kind that goes to the very extreme of kinky. They did gang-bangs, orgies, triple penetration, BDSM, porno etc. The girl is the most adorable chick you'll ever seen, as in, you'd think the butter melts in her mouth. So unless you know what's going on in their house, you wouldn't believe she's seen more than 5 dicks.  
They had a female friend accompanying them in their adventures, and she partook in the same activities. I have nothing against it, but that's some hardcore stuff; to each his own. So for years, she would get dicked down in every hole by dozens of strangers. Meanwhile, she meets this dude, a rich beta, the nicest guy on earth. Polite, educated, docile, you name it.   
They just got engaged, so I thought that, well, he's okay with her past. But no, the dude has no idea. She cut everybody from her past, including my friends, in order to avoid being slandered or uncovered. So this guy genuinely believes he's dating a nice girly girl who's barely done more than missionary in college. They are on their engagement trip as I write.   
Imagine being that man ? Fuck me.  
My own fiancee was a slut, but I knew about it and embraced it because I love whores. I have been with a lot of women and I needed someone with unlimited sexual energy. That guy is a textbook nice guy, and he's royally fucked. When the truth is revealed, he will blow his brains.  
What can I say ? Women are manipulative and evil.

88,Is Hypergamy natural? A competing theory would be that women are hardwired for monogamy. They are only hypergamous in the search for the One.,73,v3zfpk,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v3zfpk/is_hypergamy_natural_a_competing_theory_would_be/,61,"The more I observe women, the more I realize that their sex lives seem to  revolve around one ( two at most) sex partner who really did it for them. Everything they do can be explained by their relationship with that sex partner, including the fact they may have not met him yet.

The typical modern woman will go through a phase of experimentation ( late teen, early twenty), until they plateau with  that one partner ( early , mid twenty). Past that stage, the stories tend to converge.

They get into a relationship, get cheated on, cheat back or leave only to throw themselves back into a situationship with the One who may or may not have moved on to a new main woman. It's surprising how many women who go on multiple dates but consistently sleep with only one guy: the dreaded ex, the One.

From that point on, every future relationship is measured against that relationship, or is a reaction to how that relationship unfolded. This is where red pill concepts of ""imprints"", or ""Alpha Window"" comes into play.

She might reluctantly settle for a provider while her heart(her box of wonder)  still belongs to the One. She might go on a hot girl summer spree to prove something to him or herself. She might alter her appearance for the same reason. Etc..

In that regard, there is a contradiction between Hypergamy demanded by feminism and woman's natural ability to create unique, durable bonds with only a few partners. The tragedy of the modern woman ( anxious, constantly depressed, never happy) is this nagging feeling of missed reproductive opportunity with the One, who they may have either already met , or may not seem to find, despite the numerous partners they have gone through.

The Red Pill is then a lot more straightforward, albeit harder to swallow. If you're not the One for the girl, you're wasting your time. There is absolutely no point in getting into a LTR or, God forbids, a marriage.

**If you don‘t control your mind, someone else will.**

Back when I was working as a middle-school music teacher, I observed an exchange between to kids that stuck with me.

A girl and a boy were having a verbal fight. They must have been about 11 years old and you could see the first signs of their teenage-personality emerging.

The girl was more popular than the boy and she did not want him to sit in a certain chair for reasons known to her alone. 
Provoked by his refusal to comply, she unloaded a barrage of middle-school insults at him. „You are stupid!“ - „You smell like shit!“ - „Nobody likes you!“

The boy tried his best to remain calm, but she found all the right buttons to push. Despite his best efforts to keep his mouth shut, he took a big gulp of air and merely yelled one thing: „And you are UGLY!!“

Not the most sophisticated insult, sure - but he said it with such *conviction*. The girl started crying almost instantly. It was as if the boy used a mind control spell that blew straight past her defenses.

Now, since people are at their core grown up teenagers, it made me wonder: Is this happening to adults?

**Evolutionary Grooming Tech**

90% of human communication does not serve the purpose of trading information. It is an evolved tool for social grooming. It later has been repurposed into a device for sharing complex and abstract information.

The original use of language was pressure equalization between the agitated limbic systems of primate-tribes. 

As a primate, you could make dominant, agressive noises, which where then met with submissive, deescalating noises. Both you and your fellow primate then avoided a fight that could potentially leave both of you with crippling injuries - thereby conserving the strength of the tribe in the process.

The more our vocal tracts evolved, the bigger our verbal arsenal grew and the more adept we became at restructuring our social network.

**Your inner voice**
With our ability to talk we developed the ability to *self*-talk - which then allowed us to restructure our inner mental network, similar to how we structured our social relations. 

It allows us to equalize-pressure within ourselves.

This pressure-equalization usually works by bouncing the idea around in our brain over and over until cause and effect have been understood. You re-experience the stimulus over and over, as if it was happening to you again.

Once we „made sense“ out of something, it is processed. The bigger the emotional charge of a stimulus, the bigger our need to make sense of it. The more complete our understanding of a matter is, the easier it is for us to process.

Once something is processed, our psyche settles back into equilibrium. We become calm again.

If we are unable to process something fully, we get stuck on loop, compulsively playing the same thing over and over in our head - or eventually repressing it entirely.

**Magic and Madness**

Early humans believed language had magic powers. This evident in the German word for „spell“: „Zauberspruch“ translates to „magic speech“. And they were not wrong. 

Hearing or reading the right words at the right time can be the catalyst to turn men into either indomitable warriors or doubtful wimps. It sure must have appeared like magic to these people. 

Talking, hearing others talk or even hearing themselves talk could kick-start alchemical processes to clear the mind and reassemble the personality into something stronger.

Or it could irrevocably crush an improperly assembled or weakened mind.

The boy from the story forced the girl to feel sad - and there was nothing she could do about it. It was like a mind-control spell.

But these were kids - it doesnt work like that with adults, does it?

**How people hack your brain every day**

The more confused and the more emotional you are, the better your brain can be controlled by external influence. 

If your inner voice can not process external stimuli at a faster rate than they arrive, your mind will become overwhelmed. 
The more confusing and the more emotional the stimulus, the more overwhelmed you will be. And the more overwhelmed you are, the more reactive you become.

This has seen loads of professional use in advertising, politics, media and in hypnosis. The process is always similar:

- The topic at hand is made to appear relevant with a strong emotional stimulus
- You get a package of information that is either conflicting or purposely lacking key data
- While your brain is running hot decoding and processing the onslaught, you are provided with ready-made solutions as a shortcut. 
- Since your brain is a costly piece of tissue calory-wise, evolution has bred you to be more likely to accept ready-made explanations than finding your own solutions to the problem.
- The explanation is lacking, inconsistent, circular or otherwise insufficient and you are denied any sense of closure.
- This process is repeated often, compounding its effectivity with each new exposure.

Once your are able to spot this pattern, you will see it EVERYWHERE. News networks and social media companies use it to bait you into more consumption. Hollywood writers use it to write engaging storylines. And people intuitively use it on their peers to live rent-free in each others head.

The use of this technique is prevalent in our society to a terrifying degree. The majority of our populace spend their entire lives in a state of medium-to-high agitation.

However, there are people who adapted to this.

The drama-queens and energy-vampires of this world use it to suck energy and attention from their victims. It elevates them by keeping everyone else down. Here is how you recognize it.

- they blow little things out of proportion to make them appear significant
- They overreact emotionally, making themselves harder to ignore
- Their communication is purposefully vague, making it hard to logically deconstruct what has been argued.
- They make no attempt to make themselves understood. In fact, trying to understand them will suck exponentially more energy from you. 
- Everything they say or ask takes way more energy to be understood and answered than it takes for them to make it up.
- Nothing ever gets solved or closed. The longer the interaction continues, the more gets put on the table, and the more open threads you are unable to properly tie up.
- They slow down communication by either jumping topics or by being unreachable, hanging up the phone or leaving you on read.
- The conversations always contain loads of hypothetical scenarios.
- To them, if engagement in or escalation of the drama is reached, it feels like success. Their loop is closed, their thoughts are processed, while you are still agitated and busy or even stuck processing. It energizes them and leaves you drained.
- Once it appears like you are able to turn the interaction into something productive, they get „tired“, because they experience an adrenaline dump and they will try to withdraw before any closure is reached.

If you feel this sounds a lot like that one horrible ex or toxic family-member of yours - you are likely correct.

**Anti-magic to defend your mind**

As with any type of self-protection, the best defense is making sure you don‘t get attacked in the first place. 

**Stay away from toxic people and cut them out of your life as much as possible.** 
Stop watching the news, stop consuming social media, reduce your interaction with people who make their money from agitating you.

They are not incentivized to provide you with anything enlightening or satisfying. They are incentivized to syphon your attention and mental capacity and sell it off to advertisers. That is how they feed their kids.

**Clear your mind from mental and emotional clutter**

Depending on how much self-work or even self-therapy you have done in your life, chances are, you have never experienced your mind 100% clutter free.

However, once you are aware of the problem, decluttering your mind is as easy as decluttering your living space. 
It is a matter of consistently clearing up more than you mess up. Essentially, you go monk mode for a while to avoid excessive stimulation.

A great way to achieve this is working to reduce physical clutter first: Clean up your apartment, downsize, minimize. Get rid of everything you do not need. Make it a mental habit to throw things out and let them go.
If your brain has to process less visual stimuli, there is more band-with to process what is going on inside. 

Reduce your decision-work by building routines. Eat the same simple meals every day. Wear the same 5 outfits. Don‘t buy anything non-essential. 

Take lots of walks in nature. Walking enhances cross-brain communication, synching your intuition with your logic.

You will notice the process beginning to work when you become tired much more quickly than usual. You will need lots of sleep for a few days. If that happens: Sleep. Your brain needs it to restructure itself.

The final goal here is to get adjusted to the lowered noise-level in your brain, with your mind eventually becoming a pristine mountain lake.

This then tunes your senses to recognize manipulation and agitation before they grow to extreme levels, allowing yourself to counter-steer early on. 

This is of highest importance in a relationship - because trying to correct your LTRs behavior becomes increasingly difficult with every transgression you let slide.

**Verbal Judo**

Sometimes (verbal) confrontation can not be avoided and DAREing is not an option - for example in a professional environment.

The main aim of someone who is trying to manipulate, agitate or dramatize is to bait you into a high-effort reaction.
High-effort reactions make you easy to read, predict and manipulate. 

Therefore, always react to drama with *less effort* than it takes to create the drama. 

A great way is to ask open ended question but avoid making any concessions nor offering solutions.

„Yeah? How come?“
„What do you mean by that?“
„And why would you say that?“
„Okay?“

Don‘t argue - it always takes way more energy to counter-argue a point than to make it up.

On that note, another strategy is the „Half-ass counter-point“.

„Yeah… no.“
„That‘s not really how this works.“
„I feel, it is like xyz.“
„That‘s just, like, your opinion, man.“

State your point, don‘t argue it. Signal with your tone that you are fine to agree-to-disagree. If the other person *still* wants to engage, they will have to start arguing your point - which is your cue to go right back to the lazy open ended questions.

Once you clear your mind consistently remind yourself to not swallow any agitation-bait, you will gain rocksolid composure and your mind will finally belong to yourself again.",1654189745.0

Notable excerpt: ""a biracial child contains and reproduces fewer of the distinctive genes from any one of its parents than does a monoracial child. In other words, a child born to a man and women of the same ethny is genetically closer to its parents than is a mixed-race child, because the parents have many distinctive genes in common, and the child is therefore a combination of genes that make it close to both parents. A mixed-race child is genetically more distant from both parents because half its genes come from a parent from a different — and genetically distant — ethny.

The relationship can be understood this way. A parent has a certain base-line kinship with his child no matter who the other parent is, but is genetically closer to his children if he marries within his ethny. This gain in parental kinship is foregone to some extent when the other parent is of a different race or ethny. An average European white who has a child with a typical African foregoes 66 percent of the parental kinship he would have gained if he had had the child with another European. An Englishman who picks a Danish rather than an English spouse loses only one percent of the parental kinship to be gained from an English spouse. Choosing a Bantu mate would mean the loss of 92 percent of the parental kinship that would have been gained with an English mate. This figure, which is close to 100 percent, raises the theoretical possibility that if an Englishman has a mixed, English-Bantu child, the child will receive so many non-European genes from the Bantu parent that the Englishman is only slightly more genetically related to his own child than he is to a random stranger from his own ethny.""

So if you reproduce with someone of your own race, you would get more out of what you invest because more of your distinctive genes get passed on.

Might this be why people are generally attracted to those of their own race?",1654192869.0
91,[FIELD REPORT] First time pulling from a day club,87,v2jf6k,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v2jf6k/field_report_first_time_pulling_from_a_day_club/,33," **Stats:**

Age: 28

Race: Eastern Asian

Height: 5'7

Location: Las Vegas  


**Preface:** It's been pretty busy with work and with my FWBs recently so I haven't been able to run game as much. Also, through the friends I've made via night game, I've developed a social circle where we just essentially just go out and party, especially when my friends have guest in town. Which is exactly what happened last weekend. My wing D had some friends visiting and it was just a rage fest for 3 days. I met up with them at a day club. This is my second time at a day club. My first time was 8 months ago when I first started game so I was looking forward to the change in environment.  


My wing's friend had a table so my first priority was to bring girls to the table. The thing with tables is that it alters my game a bit. When I open sets, I'm essentially rushing the interaction to screen if I should bring them to the table. I have to be more selective with the girls too. They all gotta be hot and at the minimum somewhat receptive. I don't want to bring girls who's just looking for free liquor, not that the liquor matters, it's the time wasted on these girls. Inviting girls to a table is LIGHT WORK. I could do that in my sleep. What's difficult is screening for the right girls to bring back. I opened probably 15-20 sets with nothing really sticking. I still brought a few girls to the table and went back out to recruit more. 

**Set:**

1. I saw 4 white girls near the edge of the pool. I approached the one who was dancing. Let's call her Ashley. I opened with a cold read and it was an immediate hook. I spent probably 60 seconds establishing some rapport. Pretty much just location cold reads and guessing games. Turns out she's from Montana. I told her ""Hey, tell your friends you're gonna go with me to the table"". She thought about it for 2 seconds and said yes and informed her friends.   


Now, I used very specific language here. I didn't say ""hey, tell your friends let's all go to the table."". I said just her. This is because, there were too many girls there by this time and I wasn't trying to invite all 4 (yes too many girls is a bad thing as you'll read in my next FR).   


After she told her friends, I did hand of god and just lead. Just grab her hand and GO. I lead her through the crowded ass day club and we finally arrived at the table. I introduced her to some friends to build social proof not that it really matters tbh. Offered her a drink. We started dancing and grinding together. I go in for the kiss and make out. Pretty routine stuff here. We continue to make out and dance for probably 15-20 minutes.   


At this point, it's super obvious what the next step is. I knew it was time to pull but I also wanted to just keep partying. My friends were there. Tons of girls. We were at a table. The day club was lit as hell. But no, I knew what my objectives were and I must carry them out. So I told her let's grab drinks else where less loud. She agrees. I take her hand and just go.   


We had quite a long walk to the garage. I had to park at a different garage because it was so packed. During the walk, we had a pretty genuine and authentic conversation. No game-y stuff. Just a real conversation about our lives, family, job, etc. This is what I think game should be like. Good game should be 80% genuine interaction and 20% of the game-y stuff. Anyways, we get back to my place and yall know how it goes ;)  


**Key Take Aways:** 

1. You gotta persevere: I went through hella sets that didn't go away. If I gave up at set 15 then this would have never happened. Hell, some nights I go through 20 sets with nothing. Just gotta try again the next day. 
2. Go out ALOT, do it solo and you'll start to build a social circle: I started this journey solo 10 months ago. I went out 4-5 nights a week solo for like 2 months before meeting a wing. Now, I've met so many dope guys. My squad here is hella lit. Two weekends ago, my roommate had hella people in town visiting and it was another rage fest, just like this previous weekend. My point is, if you're like me and you love partying and meeting girls, and you want to build a social circle around those elements, then you gotta just go out ALOT and go solo until you start noticing guys and guys start noticing you. 
3. Table game: if you get a table, especially in vegas, don't just bring any girl to the table. Screen them first or you'll end up wasting a valuable resource: time. 
4. Let her be your champion: I didn't speak one word to Ashley's friends. I told her to tell her friends that she's coming with me. They are far more likely to be okay with her tell them than me telling them. 
5. Lead: always lead. It's attractive.",1654096851.0
92,Field Report: Pulled A Gorgeous Italian Girl Home After A Shitty Night At The Club,28,v2c4bg,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v2c4bg/field_report_pulled_a_gorgeous_italian_girl_home/,38,"Posted this field report on the South Asian sub but figured that you guys might like it as well. I rarely see other South Asian dudes post about their pulls because most Brown guys who do well usually keep all the secret sauce to themselves instead of sharing. 

I hope this post helps you guys learn a couple of new things. Things that I did wrong, and things that I did correct, especially for fellow South Asian dudes.

**Gametime!**

This was another one of those Friday nights. Me and a couple of my other boys had booked a hotel down at the city centre near where all the hottest clubs are. The plan was to pregame there with some drinks and either ecstacy or blow and then go hit the clubs and find some cute girls. My boys Alex and Jerome were supposed to join us, but Jerome didn't end up making it out with us that night. Alex still pulled through. He's one of my best dawgs I go out partying with. Coolest Whiteboy you'll ever meet. Preface: I'm Dravidian/Tamil 6'0 185lbs ripped and good looking as I've been told and Alex is around 5'9 prettyboy ladies man. Me and Alex are both in our early 20s. We met up at the hotel 11pm drank a few shots and took some E. Found a club and ubered there. We went to the club and it was bust. Too many dudes and not enough girls. Every time I talked to a girl she would either turn away from me or act disinterested and end the conversation. Alex wasn't having any luck either which is odd considering he's really good looking. I think we both approached around 12-15 girls each maybe and nothing happened. Just dead ends. I'm usually only into skinny/fit girls but I was getting annoyed at how the night was going because I usually at least get some girls who like me by this point so I approached this one chubby girl. She had really nice skin/hair and was East African. Went up said ""Hey hows your night going"" with a slight smile and suggestive eyes and took her hand. I turned her around and let her dance on me. Made small talk, and made some suggestive comments sexually. She showed me her tiktok and that she had around 150,000 followers which I found kinda cool. We ended up making out, but tbh I was ready to go home at this point. Alex was just standing next to me and this girl the whole time as he didn't find any girls for himself. It's like 2:30 am.


 We headed outside the club and were just chilling and talking about calling a ride back home to the hotel. All of a sudden this girl just came onto my boy Alex and would just circle around him and come closer then back away. Me and Alex found this mad funny cause it came outta nowhere. Out the corner of my eye I see her friend. Pretty ass girl with a crop top and short skirt not designed for this cold ass weather. 5'6 Big titties soft smooth skin with a tight ass and blonde highlights. Let's say her name is Angela. I go straight up to her and say ""Hey I'm Desifluent"" with a cheeky smile and I pulled her closer and started making out with her. It was cold, so I brought her close to my chest and helped warm her up. I looked over and Alex was making out with his girl too. We gave each other a cheeky head nod. It was game on. We asked the girls what their plan was and they wanted to go back to their nearby apartment so I called an uber there. During the ride I fingered my girl and whispered dirty stuff in her ear while also kissing her on the neck and making out. We went upstairs and saw Alex and his girl go to a room, while Angela pulled me to hers. She pulled out a bag of coke, made a big ass line and sniffed that shit like it was nothing. We were making out and I was sucking on her tits while she was straddling me and then she started to get nervous. She didn't wanna take things further. Her pussy was on my thighs and I could feel it throbbing through her panties. I asked her what was up and she asked me if I do this with every girl. I said ""Do I look like I do?"", She said yeah and asked me my bodycount. I just asked for hers and she said 9. I just continued making out with her and she ended up giving me head, but didn't let me smash. I told her she gave great head, and then cuddled with her till we both fell asleep. Morning came, it was time to leave, I told her I really liked my time with her and that she was a great girl who I wanted to see again. I took her number and left. Me and Alex went back to the hotel, took our stuff, signed out and headed back home after another crazy ass night of stories we could tell our other friends who don't come out with us. What about Angela? I ended up smashing her the next week after a date downtown.

**Lessons To Learn**

Know that every night at the club/bar won't be amazing. You're not gonna get an amazing response from every single girl you approach. Learn to regulate your emotions so that you don't develop depression after getting rejected a bunch of times. Your emotional state shouldn't be swayed by the opinion of strangers who don't know the real you.

**Pick a venue that has a good ratio of men to women.** 

Me and Alex fucked up on planning this night out. We tried this spot for the first time expecting it to be good, and the ratio of men to women fucked us over. You are fully responsible for your experience on a night out. There's no point having putting all this effort in just to pick a shitty club to go to which ruins your night.

**Learn that the Night is always young!**

 No matter what time it is, especially if you're at the city centre, young hot girls are almost always looking for an afterparty or guys to go home with. Don't write a night off just cause the club was shitty. You might actually get more ass by chatting up the girls outside the club especially if its a group of 3 girls or less.

**Pick a great wingman/wingmen**. 

I personally never go out with guys that aren't gonna help me pull. Simple as that. The only exception is if I'm going out with 1 or 2 guys who I'm tryna help/teach but other than that, going out with the wrong guys is gonna kill your night and make sure you get no pussy.

**Learn to sexually escalate fast**. 

I may write a post on this later, but in countries in the west if you don't sexually escalate especially in a bar/club context, she's gonna think you're a bitch/weird and she's gonna go find a man who knows how to turn her on and fuck her brains out. I know you may be weary of the creep label but as long as you're hyper aware of how comfortable the girl is at all times and paying attention to this while escalating, you won't be creepy. Girls go to places like clubs to either have fun with their friends or to meet hot cool guys that stimulate them. If you meet a girl and get the vibe that she falls into category #2 don't be afraid to move things forward and see if she's into it.

**It's important to have guys around you that like going out and pulling girls.**

Hanging out with only guys that do some video game shit or some other similar activity will make sure you stunt your ability to pull hot women. When I had more friends like ""Alex"" and ""Jerome"" my pull count drastically increased cause these guys would always randomly call me up to hit up some random club or party where there would be cool girls that were down. This shit would never happen if I just chilled at home playing videogames all day and didn't put effort into becoming more attractive both socially and sexually.

**Be a cool wingman.** 

Guys won't call you out with them if they don't feel like they're gonna get more girls by being out with you. If you're a pussy repellent, you'll be like my boy ""Musa"" who we all clown on because he usually fucks our plans up with girls cause he's corny and we know he can't get girls but he's a solid friend of ours. It's okay though we all love our guy Musa!. Oh it sounds superficial? So what? That's how it is. Deal with it. The world isn't here to kiss your sensitive ass.

**My mistake:** I moved things too fast without having any comfort with the girl to make her feel safe/secure. Moving too fast made her feel too slutty so even though I turned her on, she didn't wanna fuck me the same night. The following morning I gave her some comfort and validation so now she liked me more and was down to meet me later on in the week, and since I had already built up sexual tension in the first night I ended up smashing her later.

Know that even though it's good to sexually escalate, you must also add in comfort during this so that she feels safe to be vulnerable around you because you're a stranger she just met and she doesn't wanna feel used for sex.

**You don't have to smash every girl on the first date**

 As long as she's comfortable it's okay to wait till the second or third date if you still have chemistry with her. I personally have 4 dates/meetups as a max to smash a girl. If we don't end up having sex during this time I usually just friendzone/stop pursuing the girl because I know we aren't gonna be compatible.


Hope you guys enjoyed the post and learned a few more things. I'll post more of these if you guys like em. Maybe even stories of me being an idiot and fucking things up for myself so you guys know what not to do lmao. Also I wanted to add: Make sure you get your money up so you can afford stuff like this. The hotel cost around $200 which me and Alex split but including pregame, club entry, shots and Ubers I think I spent around $200-$220 that night and that’s the average cost of a night out for me. If I don’t get a hotel then it’s usually around $50 but if I Uber around then maybe $100*. The worst thing is having girls ready to go back with you but you don’t have money for a hotel room/car ride.

93,I'm FWB with my ex and found out she has a new man,367,v1vdnz,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v1vdnz/im_fwb_with_my_ex_and_found_out_she_has_a_new_man/,153," 

I have to say that this experience has completely black pilled me and made me unable to trust. I'll provide some context.

I dated this woman for 7 years. We broke up because it just wasn't working anymore, no hard feelings. A month later she calls me trying to get back together, I tell her no. She was pleading to be at least friends with benefits so I caved in, and I booked a hotel for us.

We had sex, and afterwards we were sitting on the bed to watch some TV. Mind you at this point I no longer have romantic feelings for her. She is texting someone, I ask who and she says that it's her new boyfriend.

I was completely flabbergasted. I really thought that I knew her, and that she was a good girl, but here she is getting her back blown out when she has a new man. Admittedly, I shouldn't have done this, but I let curiosity get the best of me. When she went to shower I looked through her text messages and it made me feel sick to my stomach.

This guy has been basically worshipping her, telling her she's beautiful 1000 times and on top of that has been paying for her school, gas, and groceries. Mind you they've been dating for 1 and a half months. He sends these long paragraph texts to which she always replies with a few words. He had been trying to get in contact with her for hours, and what was her reasoning? That she was hanging out with friends and couldn't find an outlet to charge her phone. She even sent him a selfie snap right after I banged her, and he has no idea.

The fact that she was able to so nonchalantly lie to him like it was nothing sent shivers down my spine. Especially because I was with her for so long and never thought that she was this type of person. This has given me trust issues that I've never had before. To top it off, we had sex three more times throughout the night during which she complained that his dick isn't as big as mine.

I know it's not fair to base my feelings off one person, but this gives me major trust issues. You would think you know someone after 7 years, but she only just now revealed her true colors to me.

I know that I should tell the new boyfriend, and that it would be the moral thing to do. However, I'm single right now and I'm not going to pass up on commitment free sex, because she'll just end up giving it to someone else, so it might as well be me.",1654017769.0
94,Navigating South Asian Stereotypes Part 1,55,v1vqke,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v1vqke/navigating_south_asian_stereotypes_part_1/,49,"This post is more directed to the South Asians on this sub, and it's a crosspost from a different sub. Also my first post on the Redpill. Never thought I'd post here but here I am lmao. Tamil Dude here to shed some light on stereotypes.

Having negative Stereotypes can absolutely fuck things up for you. Many people talk about South Asian Stereotypes, but what about how to deal with them? That's what this post is for. This post will help you tweak your communication skills so you know how to ""say the right thing"" when you present yourself. Just by breaking these stereotypes you will be seen as way cooler and more attractive.

If you sub-communicate these things while talking to someone, they'll automatically treat you way better and let you get away with more shit whereas if you fall into the stereotype, the experience usually will be a lot worse.

Here's a list+solutions:

**Misogynistic/treats women badly** - This one's a big one. Whether you realize it or not, this stereotype is killing you guys. Especially those of you who like to debate/argue back and forth with women. You being South Asian automatically makes whatever you say seem narcissistic/misogynistic and even if she gets the smallest negative feeling from you, she's gonna think you're some Patriarchy supporting guy. Women are sensitive as fuck. The slightest negative expression on your face or change in voice tone can make her feel uncomfortable. Eliminate this by always being respectful towards women, even if she says something stupid. Never make her feel like she's ""less than"" no matter what she says. Always be cool, and never do something that makes it seem like you think that men deserve more freedom/whatever than women.

**Smelly**- Self explanatory. Shower, use fragrance, and avoid eating smelly foods/spices. Don't smell.

**Takes great care of his appearance/Great physique** - Self Explanatory

**Simp** - Look man idk if its all the Bollywood movies or some bs but Brown guys tend to be simps more than other groups of dudes from what I've seen. These guys overvalue mediocre women and romanticize the shit out of basic relationships and think that every girl they meet is gonna be their wife. Girls are gonna see that and think you're a pussy if you do this shit. Cut it out! The culture doesn't help either. Coming from a culture that has ""dowry"" or ""mehr"" where you're literally expected to pay a woman's family thousands just to marry her is definitely gonna make you pedestalize basic women who would never do the same for you.

**Multi-layered friend groups** - A big subconscious red flag for women is if you only have brown friends. Especially those big fob groups with all dudes speaking some other language all the time. Having more diverse friend groups not only in terms of race, but in terms of appearance/socioeconomic class/age/profession makes it seem like you're a more nuanced person and that you have more life experience and just adds a sense of mystery to you. I have friends of all races, Jacked ass gym bros, scammers, entrepreneurs, club rats/bar hoppers, army boys, drug dealers, drug addicts, religious people, gamers, the whole shebang. Knowing all these people gives me so many stories I can tell and just makes me seem more well rounded in general.

**Privileged** - Show her you put in that work, and that you're mentally/physically skilled to accomplish whatever goal you have in mind due to your incredible competence.

**Prefers long term relationships over short term** - This automatically places you into the ""safe"", bitchboy category which most brown guys like to stumble into. Women usually like a guy who is impulsive and follows his urges. I don't say it directly, but I always present myself as a man who mainly gets with women for fun, instead of some serious formal bs. Too many brown guys are too eager to get into the ""provider"" role. Fuck that. Be able to provide, but only for the woman you're gonna marry and grow old with. I wrote a post on this you can see on my profile called ""Emphasizing the Physical Connection""

**Emotional** - For this one, the problem is that Desis are too straightforward, so if a Desi is mad, you can easily tell. Non desis are really good at hiding this shit, so they seem calm. Another thing is that Desis are too naive and trust in the good nature of others, so they think they can share their emotions/vulnerability freely, but this will just make you seem like a bitch. Don't do it. Learn to be more Disingenuous

**Parent's bitch** - This one is terrible. Make it seem like you aren't that close to your parents, or that you just don't respect their authority, but you're still kind to them. You're more of a person who does their own thing.

**Shames others** - Never ever ever shame someone else especially if it's a woman. Always let them do whatever tf they want. Don't feel like you have to ""uphold the tradition"" or some bs. It's just gonna make you look bad. Always make an effort to seem non-judgemental

**Narrow career path** - Even if all you wanna do is to be an engineer, and nothing else, still mention other non-academic goals that you wanna achieve/do. Tell people how you wanna go travel to some place and start over, or how you plan on joining some band or start making beats.

**Only dates women from his own culture** - Make it seem like you don't really have a racial preference and that you're open to all. You'd be surprised at the amount of hot white/black/asian girls who will hide their attraction to you because they think you only date brown girls or only take brown girls as a serious option. Be careful of how you word this though, or else you're gonna get cancelled for having a ""fetish"" for white/black/asian women.

**Non-Confrontational** - Develop a liking towards getting in confrontations/aggressive situations where things can escalate. Be mindful of where you do this though, you don't wanna end up dead, but always make sure you gain your respect.

**Religious** - It's especially the Muslim guys who will have a harder time on this one. Most non-desi girls no matter what they say about being ""open minded"", they don't wanna deal with some hardcore religious bs so just make it seem like you believe in a higher power/spirituality but you don't really practice religion. However, if you're a beast you could try to get her into religion as well it's up to you but its a fools errand.

**Nerdy** - This shit's quite obvious man, but it seems like a lotta guys haven't got the memo. Hot girls usually don't like that nerd shit man. So cut it out. All those nerd hobbies you got like video games, anime, certain books etc will just make you seem like a child from a woman's POV. They might be more forgiving about these things for a relationship, but for short term dating? Hell nah they usually want a stud. As a brown guy, being a nerd is even worse because women don't have any Hypermasculine Desi images in their head to counteract your childish Nerdiness. So I'd suggest completely getting rid of these hobbies and getting new ones or just don't show this side of yourself to the woman until you know she'll be cool with it.

Even when getting to know her, show her the more artsy/edgy side of yourself like how you like to travel/make music/hit the gym/cook/go clubbing etc rather than tell her about your boring endeavor of getting your degree in college.

And before we go any further. Please remember to not get gaslighted by those Desi ""uncles"" or fake woke people who try to act as if South Asian Stereotypes are just harmless, but they'll go post and cry all day about Asian/Black people's stereotypes and how ""things must change"".

All the stuff I mentioned above is like how when you're around some white people they'll do the weirdest shit to make it seem like they're not racist. Or some latino/black people will try their best to make it seem like they're not hood/ghetto so they'll say ""oh I actually don't really like basketball, and rap isn't my thing, I looooove reading books"". These are the people who never ever ever wear Jordans/streetwear, and usually dress more preppy and speak in excellent grammar because they don't wanna seem uneducated because they know that negative ghetto stereotype will fuck their image up and lead to them getting treated badly due to ignorance/false assumptions. Well this post included the South Asian version of that because you never really see this stuff discussed.

The post was getting too long so I might add another part. What are some other Desi stereotypes that you guys see? Most brown guys who do well are either consciously or unconsciously Navigating through these stereotypes, and since you are now aware of them, it will only serve to help you in your game.

Disclaimer While doing these things, it should never come across as if you're doing these things as an attempt to ""change brown stereotypes"". You should treat these things as an extension of your personality and show that ""this is how I really truly am"".

If you liked this post, join us over at the SouthAsianMasculinity subreddit which is small, but growing. We had moderation issues in the past but we're working on fixing it and having more brown guys join and post their experiences.

About 2 years ago I met Cindy(f23) on tinder and we hit it off.She was somewhat pretty.I didn't see any red flags and we did had a great first date. On the second date, I took her to my apartment where we flirted and things were leading to sex, we didn't but damn we were so close.She said she wasn't ready and I respected it and so instead we went out for some drinks. Now here's the thing, admidst the sexual foreplay before we went out, she did mention she was only looking for friends but it honestly sly through my ears (I thought it was just a playful test).

On the fourth date she finally drop the bomb and I realize she wasn't playing when she said it (Mind you, we have kiss a lot, had a third date, we were even more sexual and I have spend a lot of damn money). My mind snap back into reality because I was LEAD ON .I look at her and said that I wasn't looking for friends. She insisted to be friends because she loved the dates and the time we spend together. What I said next completely shook her! 

""When a woman wants to be friends, (especially WITH WHAT WE WENT THROUGH)  it's because she wants to keep you as a backup plan, or orbitor while she goes and explore other options"". 

I'm telling you, the moment I told her that sh!t, her world came crashing down, as if though no man has ever put her in her place. Her eyes opened wide, her jaw dropped a little and was left speechless for a minute without any rebuttal. I had one of those HAA....GOT YA  moments .From this impression alone, I've reliaze no man has ever challenge her and that most men might have be probably too nice. Again, she insisted we be friends which I responded that I have enough friends. For a third time, she insisted that we are better off as friends. I saw that there would be no end to this chat and that she couldn't understand my point of view. I finally agree to be friends, and said ""Okay sure"". When I drop her off, I shake her hand and thank her for the great time we had. I genuinely enjoy it and smile🙂.

When I reach home, I was so fckng angry😡🤬. I dispise her, the time and all the money I spend. I was so stupid and too infatuated with her.I even deleted tinder and had a little drink.

She texted me later that night and wanted to chat, I kept it short, friendly and agreeable.After seeing my non-enthusiastic and plantonic responses, She ask me if this was it? I said to her no but in my mind it was.As days pass, I never initiated contact and she eventually stop contacting me.Those weeks were bad but as time passed, I begot to heal .And I've realize I made the right decision because I rather leave than to be her good friend and see her being fck by other men. 

Thoughtout the 2 years, I kept her in my socials and I usually see her updates. She has always posted half nude pictures with most showing breast cover by her hair. And just recently, I've reliaze it's actually very sad because I've purchase 3 lands during this time. And I am LITERALLY LITERALLY seeing how her looks are deteriorating. On the other hand, Im planning to build some rental property after I finish paid off 6k in loans. It's little and yes I've lost my job but fck it. I'll be rich one day and my total net value will be well over 1 millon. And what does this chick have? Only her looks. she didn't even do something great or got some degree. I mean, there's nothing wrong with posting pics but all her pics are self center and attention seeking.It's that's the only thing you have going for yourself? I ask. what will happen when your looks begins to fade? At what age will you realize, you need to get her sht together? And to said i was really infatuated with you.

Was messing around with this chick off an app and she was pretty clingy and would invite me out to parties/bards/clubs constantly. Sometimes I went, most times I didn't. One night she drunk called me practically begging me to go out to this bar with her and I told her no. She responded with ""oh, so you want me to make out with another guy or something"". I hung up, stopped answering her calls that night, and then she called me early in the am begging for forgiveness. She was just a little distraction from med school, so I didn't lose any sleep over it.

However, I also wanted to try out some different game and I started running hard dreadgame and keeping a stone-cold frame. I noticed a massive difference in her behavior trying to increase her value to me -- she would start saying things like ""I don't give my number out often"". Sometimes I would purposely leave my phone up (I usually put it front-side down for privacy), so she could see the message notifications I would get from other girls.

I also started to give her small details about my life and she ate that shit up and wanted more. She was addicted. She would drop everything she was doing to make herself available to me, when I was only half-interested during our time together anyways.

Just wanted to post this because it seems like a lot of guys (even on TRP) underestimate playing the psych game, and many females use it to control and manipulate men.",1653882604.0
97,My favorite technique to check if the Date is still on schedule,362,v0k5y5,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v0k5y5/my_favorite_technique_to_check_if_the_date_is/,64,"
1 hour prior to the date. “Hey I’m running a bit late, around 10 minute late hopefully”, and see what they say after.


- If they say “No worries” or anything like that. Then you still good.

- If “Oh I almost forgot” then they have 1 hour to get ready and you can recalibrate the situation. 

-If “Oh sorry can’t make it today” then you at least don’t have to go through the hassle to get ready and it’s up to you if you want to reschedule or they can reschedule.

-If No Reply, Then it’s up to you if you want to reschedule or move on, but most likely it’s better to move on because if someone likes you. They WON’T forget.



A gentlemen wanted me to post this here. I posted on another Sub but a lot of the people there doesn’t get the point.",1653857621.0
98,Men and women both have dual mating strategies,128,uyn39c,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/uyn39c/men_and_women_both_have_dual_mating_strategies/,46,"Men and women both have dual mating strategies when they are able to do so

The man's dual mating strategy has a primary strategy of finding quality woman or handful of women to give his parental, provisional, protectional and associative status to as his wife (read: parenting partner), if she is high enough quality. Then his secondary strategy is to just have as much random sex with as large of a variety of women as he can that he puts no investment into

The woman's dual mating strategy has a secondary strategy to find a quality man to have children with (good genetics) and attempt to get his commitment, at least enough to be one of his partners he puts parental, provisional, protectional and associative status into.

However, that is statistically unlikely to happen. A woman's primary sexual strategy is to use one man for his genetics, then use another man for his provisioning.

This is why the female to male reproductive ratio is 17:1 during the last 8000 years (according to geneticists) even though we're also a pairboding species. (  In more recent history, as a global average, about four or five women reproduced for every one man. ) [Source](https://psmag.com/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success)

It's also why women show more attraction to high testosterone indicating males (thick jaw lines) while they are ovulating, and lower testosterone indicating males (thin jaw line) when they are not.

Women evolved this way, because it is both a personally beneficial adaptation but more importantly, it was beneficial for the species as a whole. The strong/smart got to breed more, the weak got to breed less, while all children get provisioning, protection and parental investment from at least one man.

Men and women cheating (if they can) are just following their biological drives, even though they are counter-productive to social stability and familial stability. Without a framework to deter human behavior (religion, wisdom, ethics, laws) we fall back on our animalistic defaults.

All you can do is keep women at arm's length as much as possible, to keep their behavior as good as possible.",1653615800.0

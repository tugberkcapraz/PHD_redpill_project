0,You Can't Comply Your Way out of Censorship -- Whisper Has Been Banned,412,uybakv,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/uybakv/you_cant_comply_your_way_out_of_censorship/,87,"We've known about the specter of censorship as long as we've been talking about The Red Pill. Censorship and forbidden knowledge go hand-in-hand. Knowledge cannot be forbidden without at least the threat of soft-censorship- the idea that sharing these unspeakable truths would end you in financial and social ruin. But hard censorship, deleting words off pages and outlawing words and contexts, this was always on the horizon and something we knew was a long time coming.

That's why over half a decade ago we invested in an off-site platform that would not only [archive the best of TRP](https://forums.red/i/theredpill) but also provide a [life raft and meeting place](https://trp.red) for members to continue to connect, to maintain connections, and to communicate freely, despite what every other platform tries to do.

Reddit was never going to be able to be a forever home for us. And this reality is becoming more clear by the day. After multiple mods were banned on askTRP, we made the hard decision to lock the forum and move it to https://www.forums.red/i/asktrp. We got some pushback when we did that, but the truth is, there’s more to the red pill than simply where we live and what app you use. My biggest priority during my time here was to prevent border erosion and protect the discussion. And this simply cannot continue happening on Reddit.

It started as something simple- a request. Don’t use the F word. Don’t use the R word. You can say what you’re saying but tone down the language. We implement rules for this. Then it becomes: You can’t have a frank discussion about difficulties of dating within certain cultures or ethnicities. Eventually, it became: You can’t have that specific sexual preference; you’re not allowed to prefer women without dicks **or even differentiate between them**. You can’t have that opinion; you’re not allowed to think that way. Eventually, you’re really only allowed to say specific things, *and here’s the list.*

One of Reddit's content policy rules was directly implemented to counter some of our posts. I can't even tell you the entire topic that has to be censored here, but you can find it on trp.red!

This is no way to preserve a discussion. This is no way to communicate. And this is no way to become a man who does and gets what he pleases. This is the road, paved with small concessions, to surrender all ground to the feminine imperative and cede the red pill in favor of the new, improved purple pill that takes blue pill feminism, gaslights you into thinking *we’ve always known that* about sexual dynamics, and *can’t you just improve yourself without all those darn wrong opinions and misogyny?*

And there it is. They recognized they couldn’t destroy TRP by simply removing it or banning it. So they decided to invade a male space, change it from the inside while slowly changing the rules and delivering it a thousand cuts to finally finish it off.

From a post I made 6 years ago, [The Viability of the Red Pill in the Future - Border Erosion]( https://www.forums.red/p/theredpill/70614/the_viability_of_the_red_pill_in_the_future_border_erosion):

> Every day, our mod team removes at least two or three such fellows who arrive with well meaning but misdirected attempts to tone down the misogyny here so that we can still discuss the good parts of TRP without all that hatred! ""TRP is really just about self improvement, afterall,"" they would say.


>And it certainly sounds nice to think that. Yeah, we are here to get better, aren't we?


> But serving the feminine imperative is exactly what that does. What is the word ""improvement"" without a goal to work towards? If we are making ourselves better, then to whose standard of better are we striving? If we accept the notion of dropping misogyny (or the apparent misogyny, *as it were*) and focusing only on politically correct advice such as working out and eating right, then we have done a great service to the feminine imperative. We have curtailed our own goals to serve the feminine. We have changed ourselves to benefit others. That sort of self-improvement is acceptable to our politically correct overlords. It seems so easy to adopt it and move on, that almost every single male organization did so without realizing the consequences, and are now shells of their former selves.

Being able to be unabashedly male and use whatever language to discuss whatever ideas we deem appropriate is not only beneficial to a male community- it is a requirement. It is the heart and spirit of TRP… And today, it is under attack like never before.

As of now, we have lost half a dozen or more mods, and hundreds of subscribers to Reddit’s anti-evil operations. As of this morning, /u/Whisper has finally gotten the ax. (Reach out to him on his verified trp.red account). We are no longer in editorial control of this subreddit. We do not control the message, we are not allowed to provide you the freedom to control your own message, we do not have any room to play. This subreddit is completely compromised by the admin who have been clamoring to destroy us since the beginning. Not with better, more persuasive ideas, but instead by attempting to corrupt and destroy us.

But the joke is on them. They cannot destroy these ideas. They can’t change TRP. They cannot stop the train that’s already left the station. The Red Pill is in the wild. Billionaires have used the phrase. [We’re on television](https://i.redd.it/yuekqqa34in11.jpg). We’re in your politician’s speeches. An entire generation now uses the phrase “red pilling” to indicate **WAKING UP**.

And we have https://trp.red and https://forums.red/i/theredpill to continue the conversation without being hindered by the authoritarians and bloopies who wish to see our ideas fail. It never once occurred to them that all they had to do was come up with a better idea and ours would simply fail. 

We’re not alone with this encroaching censorship. FDS finally jumped ship (and even if I think they’re morons, they deserve to be able to speak). Incels were banned. MGTOW canned. Where All the Good Men Are got temporarily banned, but they know what’s coming for them. In fact, they’re so convinced that they’ve moved their (hilarious and fun) operations to https://www.forums.red/i/whereareallthegoodmen and  https://www.forums.red/i/whereallthegoodmenare. 

Our time is nearing an end on reddit. This message is for those who come here after we are no longer able to get the message out. Reddit is dead. We will no longer be able to maintain a proper conversation here. As a means of keeping the door open we will not be locking the forums as of yet, but we keep them open with the following warning:

I am still at the early chapters of the Handbook and cannot quite pin where this situation stands:

I met a girl at a festival, we exchanged instagrams and now I am seeing that 80% of her stories are heavy drinking and partying. I tease her about that for a while and yesterday I asked her   
""I can't remember, but are you studying something at the moment?"" 

My intention was to spin this around college parties and invite myself to one. She answered with ""No, I  don't study anything"", but some time has passed and I was out of the mood for texting and into the mood for going to bed, so I just decided I will answer in the morning.

This morning I just left her on ""seen"" and texted nothing back. I realized that I don't feel like continuing the topic and really can't bother with coming up with something witty to say. I think I will just text her in a few days about some other topic.  


How would you classify the current situation? I think it is qualification/rapport break, but I also want to hear more experienced opinion, to check if I am understand correctly what I read in the Handbook.",1663580656.0
2,CorporateLand: Don’t Kill the Job v. Quiet Quitting.,266,xf7fwr,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/xf7fwr/corporateland_dont_kill_the_job_v_quiet_quitting/,48,"**CorporateLand: Don’t Kill the Job v. Quiet Quitting.**


So two different convos with two of my young protégés has led me to this and probably another CorporateLand post: Just when you think you are out of CorporateLand, they drag you back in.  

Today’s Lesson: Don’t Kill the Job.

What does that mean?  So your old, wise Uncle Vaz, in the dark old days when your parents were young – your parents used to be young, btw.  And they used to *have sex*.   With Each Other.  I know */shudder*, you think they only had sex once per kid, but really they fucked like bunnies.  Your mom used to be totally down.  Anyway, it is how it is – was in a labor union.  

If you have ever been in a union, you have undoubtedly heard the phrase, *“Don’t kill the job.”*  You will have heard this if you worked on a quota system – I actually did not, but I know guys who did (UAW).  So what does it mean?  It means, if your quota is 17 cars and you can build 26, do you build 26?  Fuck no.  Why?

Don’t kill the job.

If you blow it out to 26, your quota will rise to 26 and you will miss out on milking the job on the way up, and therefore you will miss out on all that sweet, sweet profit-sharing.  Is it a scam?  Sure.  Just like lawyers who pad their hours, and department heads who have to “spend their budgets”.  Everyone knows about it, and everyone does it.

In CorporateLand, you know what happens when you’re an “exempt” employee?  You don’t get paid for overtime or doing extra work.  You also don’t get paid for doing less work.  Which one would you rather be?  

*“But Uncle Vaz,”* you say, *“What about having a strong work ethic?  What about ‘citizenship’ behaviors, like coming in early and working late?”*  All that’s great, particularly when you’re a scrub and you’re just starting out.  Also if you work in a small business and you need to get noticed by the owner.  But we’re talking CorporateLand here.  Dafuq are you working late for?  Can’t get your shit done during work hours?  Also, for some unknown reason, among Boomers coming in early “counts more”.  Not sure why.  Never cared.  

All ‘citizenship’ behaviors get you these days is ‘citizenship’ fatigue. Once upon a time, I watched a guy in a parallel department whose boss was retiring bust his ass for a promotion.  In fairness, the guy was a hard worker anyway.  He ‘invested’ in his work with the idea he’d slide into that spot, and, in years past, he would have.  

Except.  You guys can see the falling anvil, right?

Except the company had been bought by private equity firm that is all about extracting every last nickel.  So he didn’t get the promotion.  Nobody did. The position was eliminated.  You know what he got?  He got his old boss’ *WORK.*  You know what else he didn’t get?  Any extra pay.  

Now, there are certain benefits to being prosocial.  I’m a believer in it, in terms of building relationships and making my life easy.  As I say, *“Make sure you have a positive balance in the ‘Favor Bank’.”*  But don’t let yourself get taken advantage of.  Right after the next bonus cycle, that dud was *gone*.  

I left myself some time thereafter.  About 3-4 years later I was back in the building working for a couple of weeks at a location my new company had there, training up some young MFers – kind of like what I do you guys only with much more of a filter – and I bumped into some of my former co-workers.  I asked about a few people and they had all left – these were folks who you would *want* to have kept.  So basically things got worse, and the people with options left.  That operation is still going on, but it’s not the place it used to be.  I suppose that’s fine with ownership, so long as they can load it up with debt, pay themselves fees, B/K the place and move on to the next acquisition.

**Quiet Quitting.**

I don’t know who thinks this is some sort of recent development, but about half the country is “Quiet Quitting” at any given time.  Just doing the bare minimum not to get fired.  Just think of retail alone.  The overwhelming majority of people don’t have careers, they have jobs.  Some folks are in and out of the labor market on purpose.  I knew a guy who would work, take double shifts, save his $ and then quit and go surfing or skiing for 3 months.  I knew a couple that were both attys.  They would do doc reviews for 6 months and then take 6 months off.  People use the labor market differently.  

My way of thinking is: *""The purpose of my 9 to 5 is to give me the 5 to 9 I want – popping bottles and shagging models.""* I say that (mostly) in jest, but the reality is that whatever your work is, unless you are one of those rare people who gets to work in something they love – Chris Martin and Mick Jagger, I am looking at you - then the purpose of your work is to provide you and your family and loved ones with comfort and care.

As always, gents, stay lean, stay hungry, and keep stacking paper and building your world.",1663274677.0
3,Schrödinger’s Girlfriend,260,xeo5r0,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/xeo5r0/schrödingers_girlfriend/,86,"**Schrödinger’s Girlfriend**

*“Girls are never single, girls are never in relationships.”*

-From, “The Sayings of Chairman Zaitzev”

Girls fuck like we eat sandwiches.  That option is always available to them.  BBQ chicken with cheddar and bacon?  Nah, a Reuben today.  Oh, wait, I changed my mind.  I’ll have a BLT.  It’s that easy for them.  They walk around with a box between their legs that grants wishes.  

As I have written before, to you, it’s a precious commodity; to them it’s a universally accepted form of payment.  A woman with a sex drive like a man can sate that, at will, every night of the week.  She can hold out on you, because, for her, sex is *always* on the table.

Yeah, I know.  It’s a bit depressing.  If we were women we’d buy vibrators and never leave the house.  I would fuckin 100% do that.  But I’m glad I’m a dude, and a High Gas dude at that.  Why?  Because we literally can do everything else.  And that has value.  So once you pull your head out of your ass and make something of yourself, women will be *lining up* to give you pussy.  

So that brings us to Schrödinger’s Girlfriend.

**Girls Are Never Single**

There is always (or nearly always) a guy they are (a) fucking, (b) they want to fuck, and/or (c) they are currently withholding sex from, but are fucking.  And that can change at any moment. 
You might bang them on Thursday and think things are great, only to have them ghost you.  You pore over your text messages to see where you went wrong.

Don’t.  It’s not about you.  Her ex pinged her and wanted a second chance. Or you were a revenge fuck to make things “even” with her cheating boyfriend.  Or the Chad she was chasing had and opening.  Don’t torture yourself.  Be happy you hit and move on.

**Girls Are Never in Relationships**

For the right guy, girls are always single.  You know you have them when they aren’t playing games because they can’t *afford* to play games and risk you walking away.  This is a version of the *‘Fuck YEAH!’* girl.  Hypergamy is a cruel master.  If you’re a reach for her, she can’t miss out.

Which guy do you want to be?

4,Gameplan for newbies by a newbie :),24,xe37v8,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/xe37v8/gameplan_for_newbies_by_a_newbie/,69,"Hola amigos!! This is my current gameplan.  Please note that I am a newbie and a few days ago I completed seddit's 100sets challenge. During the challenge I was doing daygame only and was using direct game (stating your interest right at the beginning). 

I learnt a lot about what game is and how to go about practising this beautiful art in a consistent manner. While doing direct game I observed that, whenever I reduced the time in between the sets I entered flow state which made my next interaction go very well..I was also able to get a few closes (5- IG close and 1- number close, although they didn't go anywhere). 

The problem or challenges with direct game that I found: 

As I was and am doing only daygame in the malls. I had a REALLY HARD TIME coming across a single girl, most of the women were in the groups and I had no idea how to approach groups. But out of naivety I once made a direct approach to a group of 3 women. It freaked them out and they gave me really dirty looks, which fucked my mental state that day. That's when I decided to change my strategy to indirect game.

I have used this gameplan to CONSISTENTLY open groups and single women in a daygame setting with great success (At my current skill level I am getting good reactions). After doing the initial 3-4 sets I am in flow state which makes me come across as outcome independent and confident. People pick on this energy and are drawn to me because of this.


Now the actual nuts and bolt of my gameplan:-

Opener:- 'Love vs Being in Love with someone' opener. (Took this from rules of game)

Me: Hey i have only got a second before I leave, but i want your guy's opinion on something. (False time constraint- very critical always use this before opening a set)

Group/Girl: Sure.

Me: What is the difference between love and being in love with someone? The reason I am asking u is this because I just received a text from a friend of mine, her bf broke up with her. He told her, ""he loves her but he is not in love with her."" What's very strange is that my friend heard this exact speech given by her friend  the other day to someone. Since then she and I have been figuring out what it means? 

Group/Girl: blah blah.

Me: I guess that makes sense. Because if i go to my best friend, hug him out and say, ""I love you."" It would be okay. But if go and say to him, ""I am in love with you."" He will probably punch me and freak out.

From here u can tease her about her shoes/goggles etc. (This is called as disqualification)

Then transition to cold reading/ring finger routine-  google this u will find the required info :).

Try initiating physical touch in your interaction (CALIBRATE and then go for it)..

In every interaction try to push your limits..that is take calculated risks which will help u develope social intelligence.

Once u get 3 IOIs qualify her/ connect with her and finally go for close or go for Insta date if u feel like the interaction is going well. ( Go for close irrespective of how the interaction is going..just for practice)

Some foot notes & observations:-

1: I will probably get downvoted for this...but initially i was very skeptical about this material wheter it would work or not..But once I started internalizing this particular material...My delivery, body language, along eye contact and all the non verbals improved..which caused the interactions to go really well. 

2: Having a memorized line helped me get over the fear of approaching. Because I know exactly what to say. This helped me to come across as more confident and make a great impression. Also, as a newbie I am opening 7 sets daily which adds to 49 sets a week..If u keep this up for one year..you will have approached 49 sets ×53 weeks = 2597 sets in a year (Imagine the experience and the powerful set of social skills u will have after a year.) 

3: Even If i have a success ratio of 0.4 % in 2597 sets.. that translates to 11/10  in a year. (Not bad for a newbie)

4: Memorizing may seem conniving or unnatural initally but this is how the old school guys did it. The so called gurus u see today have got good by following a structure. Once they got good and developed calibration and social intuition they started doing advanced stuff..Use these as training wheels for your first 1000 approaches. Don't reinvent the wheel.

5: First set of the day is always the hardest, get it done as soon as u enter the venue. Follow 3 seconds rule. After sometime u will start feeling good..So do the sets irrespective of how u are feeling..(Use your common sense.. don't take this statement to the extreme and at face value, just because I said so.. Don't approach if u had an accident/friend died or some other traumatic life event.. REMEMBER TO USE COMMON SENSE)

6: I want to try night game but getting into clubs daily and paying for cover charges is a huge cost for me due to my current financials. I am currently solving that area along with this area.. Hopefully in six months I will be able to afford to go clubs daily and practice my night game.

6: I haven't still got a close from this approach any feedback on how to solve this would be appreciated.

7: Finally a quote from Bruce Lee to end this, ""Absorb what is useful. Discard what is not. Add what is uniquely your own.""

Hope this helps. Do try this and let me know how it went. :)

5,Why some post wall women get married and have staying power,46,xdjhsw,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/xdjhsw/why_some_post_wall_women_get_married_and_have/,38,"I’ll cut right to these chase: generics and low n count. 

Now what post wall women am discussing? The party girl who rode the cock carousel and now wants to settle down? The chronically abused woman who can’t help but date men who beat her? No no, I’m talking about the women with the least incidents of falling into the hypergamous nature. Now these women are the ones who generally don’t fear being lead by their men, are far less combative than your average woman, typically their n count is lower single digits (1 to at the most 3) with no incident of casual sex of ex-hookups, I attribute this to upbringing more than the nature of women. Now how does these older women end up finding commitment despite their old age? 

Genetics: a woman in her 30s that doesn’t look 30 can easily find commitment, her outward appearance projects fertility and youth and I suspect that these women do stay fertile for longer than the average woman in her early to late 30s. It helps to squash the feminist argument that men prefer old women, numerically these women are old by physically and biologically they are still young and fresh in a manner of speaking. But, it is not just genetics at play here; women who take care of their bodies and skin will look younger and be more fertile and youthful than their peers. I have witnessed a older woman do complete 180 after she took charge if her health and appearance, looked busted but several months later was looking very fresh. No work done as she is too poor to afford this and doesn’t partake in the sugar dating arrangement (stereotypical church mouse type without the slutty history). 

The only older women getting wifed up or LTR’d are those that are still youthful, have maintained peak fertility and have an agreeable nature and a body count of zero or 3 through their entire lives. This is speculation and I am purposely excluding the betabux relationships here as I don’t consider them valid, I’m speaking of real men who pick these women as help-mates.",1663105203.0

So I ask him if hes got rubbers, ""No, I dont, but she does?"". Told ese to go and buy some, hers may not fit him right, and last thing we need our accidents at our age. So this bitch ahead of us in the lunch line chimes in, and ar first, I wont lie she gave a solid bit of advice, that he should visit a health center and get them for free.

7,Anger Precedes Desire,81,xarwiq,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/xarwiq/anger_precedes_desire/,27,"# What is Anger?

Anger is a physiologically excited state which signals that you perceive that something is wrong and should be made right. Anger need not necessarily manifest as physical violence/harm. Call this being **assertive**. Assertion is the utility of masculinity.

The normative claim is the zero level of your desire and will. If you want something, you are implicitly making a normative claim that something is wrong (not having, doing, or being that thing) and should be made right. Do not suppress this fundamental perception due to postmodernism or whatever. The other option is roll over and spread your cheeks.

The purpose of this post is to encourage you to introspect and unravel the knot you may have around anger and aggression so that you will stop languishing. For example, my father was a dumb cunt and expressed his anger towards his children like a emotional retard - yes, that is the scientific term. This unsophisticated interpretation of anger stayed with me until I unraveled the logic and assumptions with which my subconscious operated.

# Final note

You probably have a ton of unsophisticated interpretations of many aspects of reality that you formulated when you were an illiterate child. I know I did and do. I highly encourage you take the time to introspect and fix your bullshit. Your inner world determines your outer world. Also just because you make a normative claim does not mean it is respectable.",1662823122.0
8,Crawl Out Of The Metaphorical Vagina (You're Not Special) [Guest Post],166,xa5a1a,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/xa5a1a/crawl_out_of_the_metaphorical_vagina_youre_not/,31,"**Intro**

If you're a respected member of any community like this one, you end up getting a lot of DMs. About 90% of them follow this process and need the title answer:

> plz bro i need advice can i ask you a question IMMEDIATELY I NEED HELP NOW

> i'm trying to figure out what to do in my life, i've tried nothing and i'm all out of ideas

> i am a [some age] loser with no friends and no career direction

> how do i fukkk girls????

BTW - don't ask if you can ask a question. Tremendously annoying. Anyway...

------

**Diagnosis**

With said 90%, every time they:

1. don't lift hard, 
2. haven't socialized whatsoever,  
3. think a woman will somehow make them not an uninteresting, unlikeable BITCH

What I have to tell them is simple, but the fix isn't going to be easy. I tell them, 

>""You are parasite #125781025 in my DM who thinks they need a Mystical Red Pill Wizard to tell them the magic spell incantation. Even if I gave you legit advice, you'd use that to feelz good and continue your plan of inaction."" 

Seeking my advice when you're this far behind is fucking stupid for 3 reasons:

1. There is nothing I can tell you that you could not figure out yourself, because you're failing the basics by not trying

2. Outsourcing your decision making to me, and therefore your agency and masculinity, will never work

3. A woman cannot fix this problem, even if you miraculously manage to attract one in this pathetic condition - you'll be back 3mos later with a sob story about how she ""was BPD bro""

--------

**The Problem**

Boys spend nine full months trying to exit their mother's vagina. In the age of the internet, for some reason many are trying their hardest to crawl back in. 

*Why can't you make friends?* 

Because your interests are computer bullshit and you're therefore not INTEREST-ing. 

*Why can't you stick to a plan that betters your money, your physical shape, your status?* 

Because you are a lazy fuck who decided mommy's food is enough to wake up every day.

*Why can't you get girls?* 

Shit, have you even tried to fuck one recently?

You can’t get any pussy, much less any friends, if you’re nestled nice and cozy in mommy’s womb. 

**The Solution**

Want a change? Don't fucking bother some guy like me, DO THE BASICS. 

If you read TRP stuff daily, you have mental issues. Another book isn't going to get you out of the vagina, updating your resume and hitting the gym 4x/wk will. 

**And don't think friends will solve the problem.** You'll just be crawling into their asshole hoping the Magical Friend Fairies somehow ""motivate"" you instead of doing the work. Last time I checked, notably, you need consent to get in there. 

You need a MISSION. You need GOALS that support that mission. When you have those, you can wake up in the morning and have a purpose instead of living a life of distraction. 

Just remember to practice good personal hygiene - that pussy smell is gonna be on you for awhile. Good luck getting outta there.",1662754357.0
9,Men Are Now Paying For Poor Female Choices in the 1960s and 70s,227,x78xgn,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x78xgn/men_are_now_paying_for_poor_female_choices_in_the/,117,"The traditional dynamic was that women offered sex, men offered money, resources and security in return \[unless you're outrageously handsome into the bargain, the MRS equation is the one which really counts for the female arbiters\]. It was always tacitly accepted that women had the upper hand in all sexual negotiations, because of the much higher male sex drive. But, it all got out of kilter during the sexual revolution of the 1960s. Flush with the liberating novelty of the birth control pill, women were dispensing their main asset too easily. The price of pussy plummeted, smash and dash became the norm. Single parenthood went through the roof, female (and government) panic ensued, third wave feminism took off, putting pressure on politicians, who are only too keen to pander to the majority of the electorate. The plan was simple. *'We must make it easier for women to earn their own money. We need to try to reverse this current promiscuity by making it more difficult and dangerous for men to interact with women, and we'll fleece men's assets if they become fathers.'* Now, we have male earning power eroded through EEO/AA, while female sexual power has been artificially bolstered through laws which demonise men, and could criminalise them for daring to *look* at a woman in the street, far less approach her for a chat, to assess compatibility. Financially depleted men walk a minefield of women whose value has been artificially inflated by anti-male legislation. We are all paying the price for choices made by women more than half a century ago, when (courtesy of science) they finally gained control of their own fertility, and used it to try to make fathers out of Chad Thundercock.",1662466134.0

3 years ago I discovered TRP, the formula was alien to me, it was something I had rarely seen anywhere except for what the older men I knew in family had vaguely told me in forms of advice. But I had always accepted what they said as ""bitter oldman gibberish"". Then after a week of reading the side bar and most of the top posts, books, subjects about female behavior, frame and overall masculinity; I began to see that the TRP was happening all around me, under the fabric of my everyday life. 
It was right under my nose and I had missed it. 
I was 22 5'9""/175cm 123lb/57kg at the time, typical white knight, typical emotional tampon, typical third wheel, got bullied through school, smoked cigarettes as a crutch, smoked weed to ""open my mind"" ironically. 

And yet at that time, I saw myself as a hero from some fantasy book.
But in reality, I was just a big head on a really skinny and weak body with a weaker and skinnier brain inside my head; driven by dopamine.

I got constantly laughed at by friends and strangers, getting called pretty boy, addict, which i took for jokes, I was always the one pleasing everybody, thinking it being ""good"".

And so after reading and seeing the truth, I began to take action, I started with running, could not breathe the first few session cause of all the cigs. but i pushed through.

then after a while started doing push ups and pull ups. All the real feel good hormones started to replace the old ones in my brain.
I went like this for 2 months straight, I didn't gain much weight but i could see that my figure had changed. I could see and distinguish every muscle. (I had isolated myself for all that time)

Now after the noticeable changes I started to see how others react differently to me, showing more respect. Having to speak less because my struggle spoke for itself.

Now i was hungry for more so i hit the local gym and began to lift the real shit.
and by the time i was 23. I was noticeably athletic. 

This was when I began to apply frame,
and this is when I found a 9.

I began to mess around with this girl and we were fucking like rabbits.

AND THEN, It all went downhill from there.
I thought i had finished the TRP marathon.
I thought of it as one big dopamine hit.

So I started smoking again, skipping important shit just to fuck this girl.
Skipping the gym, pulling off pointless all nighters.
and eventually, I was right back where i started.

A dopamine addict.

But If i owe myself anything is to get it all back.

EDIT 2:
For those who are wondering:

During the peak of my training, I was 23-24 60kg with very little fat percentage, I remember getting asked by trainers about my diet and exercise plan, getting recommendation on what to do, and being spotting buddies.

Outside the gym I was mentally euphoric, very sure about myself and what I wanted to do next and what my ultimate goal was. I would rarely talk mostly kept my mouth shut because i appeared trustworthy, others did the talking and i contributed very little unless asked to.

The same people that bullied me and made fun of me now admired my hard work when i occasionally ran into them. Most of which were genetic alpha types (born tall/big/muscular). I made friends with some of the bullies who where assholes with goals and made the rest invisible in my mind.

I live in a tough city, the criminal mindset is the bible here. ( being a crook is seen as being somewhat kingly)
Although I rarely got myself involved in their business. I was welcomed as an outsider/guest among them.

One thing I can tell you for sure is at this day and age where everybody is either high,drunk or just plain fucked up on something; And you're just sitting sober among them. The Alpha types see you as their own.",1662442046.0

Women have invaded previously male employment opportunities, didn't like what they encountered, and were determined to change these to their advantage, as soon as female critical mass was reached. Nature made it easy for them. Women stick together, no matter how illogical their 'concerns', and men compete with other men, not with women. With a female workplace adversary, men will inevitably defer, it's never a good look to keep illustrating the flaws in their argument, too easy to be labelled as a bully, or worse. As a result, men must now tiptoe through a feminised workplace. With the decline of heavy industry, there are few male workplaces left intact, apart from the dirty and dangerous ones. Every year, more of the clean, high-paying jobs are filled by women. Yet, men retain all of the disadvantages of courtship.... having to make all of the approaches (in an increasingly hostile social environment), picking up the tab for the outrageous expense involved, and with the constant threat of rejection. As a result, modern women have gained financial parity while retaining sexual advantage. They can have their cake and eat it....

12,FR: This shit works for real,343,x6amnp,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x6amnp/fr_this_shit_works_for_real/,206,"M35, Married 1 year.

My wife, who is generally submissive and follow orders like a good teammate, since just recently has been throwing tantrums and nagging. Probably due to comfort setting in. She's the type of woman who works out, doesn't drink/smoke, takes good care of my home, is generally very sorted in a life. Whenever we go out men are always checking her out and she knows it.

One day we were having dinner with my dad, and he simply pointed out a mistake she had made in preparing gifts for her parents. My wife lost her cool, took it on her ego probably, and behaved in a rude way with my dad. That was totally uncalled for, my dad was generally being ""the big man"" trying to point out a mistake in a humble way. No where did he step out of line. But her reaction was totally out of line. I did not like it. I cannot stand for toxic behaviour in my house especially when it is uncalled for. And my dad means a lot to me to, he's been a good father and taught me invaluable life skills.

Immediately when my wife spoke (shouted), I corrected her, and told her ""that is not how you speak."" Never have I felt the need to correct her in the presence of others, this was the first time. 

For the following two days, my wife is visibly pissed, not talking to me. I can sense that she feels guilt for the way she acted. She slept in the other room the first night. I didn't GAF. I proceeded with my routine: wake up at 6, work out, head to work, come home, go for a run, eat dinner, work, read and sleep. The following night when I call it a night and switch off the lights, my wife gets close and holds me tight, trying to initiate. I was sleepy as hell, had a big day the next day, I didn't react and I fell asleep. The next morning I proceed with my routine.

She works in my company (work from home) and takes care of the home, cleaning and cooking. She texts me ""I spoke to xxx company I worked for previously about a job. They are willing to take me back and I'm taking it."" I don't reply. I knew she's just trying to get a reaction from me. I sense it is an empty threat. (fast forward, that's exactly what it was) 

When I return home, she says she wants to talk. I say ""about what?"", she says ""about that dinner with dad.""  I told her ""you need to cut shit out, that was clearly disrespectful. You have a choice, family comes first, or I'll bring the divorce papers and you simply have to sign it.""

She goes all mad. Says ""Ok I'm leaving for my mom's, send the papers to me, I'll sign it."" I say ""OK"". In the meantime, she's packing her things, returns her wedding ring and a diamond necklace I gave her (my dad gave to me to gift her), and leaves. I didn't react. Didn't even say a goodbye, didn't even walk her to the door.

15 minutes later she returns. She apologizes and tells me she'll never repeat it. Then she throws a shit test ""I thought you will come after me after I left to stop me from leaving, but you didn't."" I said ""I was gonna. You returned too soon.""

The proceeding night she dresses up in erotic lingerie, gives me a treat for my eyes and we have pornstar sex. The following morning I suddenly wake up at 5:30 with her mouth moistening my morning wood. We proceed to bathroom sex and shower together.

This shit really works. What shit? STFU. IDGAF. My frame not hers. Dread.

I didn't flinch to her threats, I showed her that she is discardable if she doesn't behave (divorce papers), didn't get all whiney and apologetty, didn't stop her when threatened to leave. Didn't try to ""keep her"" when she said she's quitting my company. They come around still. They always do.

It describes a ‘path’ that is only going to become more & more common among women. Women whom, have been brainwashed by society to spend their 20s chasing Chad, 'experiences', a career and ‘independence’. And only find out in their 30s (or even later) that there was a good reason women of the past tried to marry & settle down asap.

This post is not meant to shit on OP, but strictly for educational purposes. Like I said, there are many women like her and many more to come. Stuff like this should be mandatory reading for every young man.

**There's a lot of hamstering, but if you want to read the entire thing, be my guest; I have bolded & italicized the 3 nuggets**. If you read the 3 nuggets while skipping everything in between, it actually condenses the post perfectly.

>Hello RPW. I have been a lurker for several months. I am here for advice as someone who has discovered RP a bit late. I appreciate the logical, honest responses I see on this sub.  
>  
>TL;DR: I (33F) am someone who has never considered marriage or children as a must-have in life until recently. Now it’s all I can think about as it relates to my 6.5-year relationship with my boyfriend (34M) who is a wonderful, stable man who I trust wholeheartedly, respect dearly, have fun with, and love... despite his openly neutral-veering-on-negative feelings towards the institution of marriage.  
>  
>**My Background**  
>  
>I am 33F. So far in my life I haven’t been one to definitively say my life will or won’t go any certain way. I have been open to all relationships, friendships, opportunities, etc. While keeping a logical mindset in terms of making sure my life is in order to my standard (think: my needs are met, I am financially secure, I am happy, I am healthy). I don't think of myself as RP necessarily, or traditional. Feminist messaging was/is a constant in my life (think: men suck, you're independent and can do anything without a man, you are better than a man, etc.). But I like to think I'm very level-headed, rational, and a critical thinker, so I've never fully bought in to that messaging (or dismissed it) and more now than ever have been questioning it and exploring other points of view.  
>  
>Also up until now, I never thought I'd definitely get married, or definitely have kids. Or definitely hit any kind of milestone. I think part of my mindset with marriage is due to my upbringing. My parents weren’t married until I was 16 years old and even then, once they did marry, it was for insurance/tax purposes and very low-key (courthouse, steak dinner, done!) This view of marriage kind of being an afterthought and not really necessary definitely stuck with me.  
>  
>Despite that, I love relationships! Ever since college, I have loved spending my time with a partner who is my closest “person” and who I enjoy their company (until, well, I don’t). With each relationship I had been in through my adult years since I was 18, four relationships varying in length between six months – three years, I’ve learned more about myself and what I want from a partner. Which brings me to my current relationship (my fifth and longest relationship) and where I’m at now!  
>  
>**My Current Relationship**  
>  
>I’ve been with my boyfriend (34M) since I was 26 and he was 27, just about 6.5 years. When I met him I was at a place where I was being more intentional about what I wanted from a future (and hopefully final or very long term) partner. I had no label for it then, but I do believe now in looking back, that I vetted well simply in terms of who I wanted to be my boyfriend and partner (again, no label for it, more so just common sense – I had learned a lot up to that point and I could see so many qualities in him that made me feel happy safe comfortable etc). I distinctly remember at the time thinking “I want to be with someone that I can respect.” And he was and still is someone I respect and trust fully.  
>  
>Only thing was, in looking back, he was open about his negativity towards marriage from the start when we were only friends for a few months. Not in any serious conversations, but in passing conversations like “Oh I’ll never get married; it’s an outdated institution,” or explaining his past where his parents weren't married and his dad had been through a bad divorce so he believes it to be non-beneficial or even risky to a man.  
>  
>At the time, I thought nothing of it (or even thought wow that makes sense for a man) because I could have cared less about getting married. It wasn’t on my radar AT ALL. And so I entered in to a relationship with him, that not being in my mind at all. I was focusing on work and a hobby I love. I was paying off student loan debt. I was enjoying friendships and independence. All the while still benefiting from having my boyfriend by my side and enjoying my times with him. When COVID hit at at the \~4-year mark of our relationship, we were living together and I was happy to have him to spend my days with. We got a puppy during that time and I started to fall in love with the idea of a family. That was about 1.5 years ago and probably was the very first flicker of the light that sparked this whole journey of realizing I actually do see the meaning in marriage and do want that for my own life.  
>  
>However, it was a slow burn until something significant shifted in me ***a few months ago.*** ***I started really digging in to fertility research. First, feeling anger that I was so unlucky to have to be a woman and be faced with this ticking clock.*** Then, leaning in to the fact that I'm so lucky to be a woman and have this ability in me! Further embracing more of my feminine qualities which does come quite natural.  
>  
>So all of a sudden, very quickly, the following realizations have happened:  
>  
>1) I am realizing how much I want to try and have children and to be so lucky for that to be a part of my life. (have confirmed boyfriend also would like to have children, whereas he's been unsure / neutral on that topic before as well) And that I specifically want to have my boyfriend's children >>>  
>  
>2) ***Which led me to the realization that I want marriage because of the security and sensibleness of it for a woman who is having children.*** Plus the togetherness of it all and being a family and leaning in to my feminine self as a part of a marriage and sharing a name and \*\*butterflies ensue\*\* >>>  
>  
>3) Which always leads me to the realization that my boyfriend has expressed to me he doesn't want marriage. And sadness in realizing that I'm getting to this a little bit late to have options I may have had before.  
>  
>Phew, okay, so you can see how this spirals. Writing this has been cathartic. But now to put this in to a question I am asking for advice on:  
>  
>**My Question...**  
>  
>I’d love to show my boyfriend what I've discovered about marriage, and for him to feel a desire for marriage too (as well as a relationship where he embraces his masculine traits and I embrace my feminine traits). How do I do this, with all of the considerations in mind, and without being a nag?  
>  
>I don't think that an ultimatum is an option for me given my age and desire for having his children. And, frankly, I love the life I have with my boyfriend and dog so much that I'd sooner stay with him forever as a girlfriend than leave him for not wanting marriage. At the same time, ***without marriage I think I'll be so scared of him ending things suddenly at no risk to him when it comes to children (since he still has so many years left and could find a younger woman to have his children).*** And thus, based on our nature of being a man versus being a woman, I understand now why marriage exists still and why it's important. If you've made it this far, I appreciate you reading and would love to hear any thoughts or advice, positive, critical, or otherwise.

What entertains me especially is that nowhere in the post or comments someone talks about what she can offer in return for marriage. What she can offer in return for half his assets. The truth is that the only thing she can realistically offer is whatever she has not 'handed over' **yet**. In this case, birthing him children & taking care of those children. The catch is, that's in her best interest as well.

So what it comes down to is that women like this want something (very expensive) at no direct cost to them other than opportunity cost. But you will rarely if ever hear a woman talk about this, as it's not a particularly great deal for the counterparty. Which is why great marketing is a must.

Most people today in the western world (especially men it seems) don't know how to play the power game. We rather moralize and virtue signal than deploy Machiavellian tactics to achieve our own interests with as little compromise as possible. Putin's Russia (supposedly a backward country & culture) cucking the entire EU is a fine example. Imagine making fun of an economy that's a pumping station, but it turns out that your own economy and political system falls apart without one.

Anyway, as a good friend of mine likes to say about power games played in the corporate world; 'Everybody is participating, but there are few who play'.

14,Super simple “Basic Guy Game” structure that will help you begin meeting women.,157,x5p799,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x5p799/super_simple_basic_guy_game_structure_that_will/,36,"You want to meet new women but you have no idea how. You dont know how to approach, what to talk about, what to say or what to do. When you do approach your mind runs a million miles a minute because you are nervous and feeling the pressure. 

All of the above is normal and commonly happens to men who are new to meeting random women outside your social circle. 

What I have for you is something called “Basic Guy Game.” BGG works by reducing seduction down to its most raw essentials and will help you work on getting comfortable with the “building blocks” of male to female social interactions.

The structure works like this:  

See attractive woman -> say “Hi, what’s up?” -> If good reaction ask her for her name and then give yours. If bad reaction tell her to have a nice day and walk away -> Ask her something about about herself such as an item of clothing shes wearing. Talk about anything but try to keep the conversation about her as she doesn’t know you yet so she doesn’t really care about you. -> After a few minutes tell her “You seem cool. Let’s exchange numbers and see if we click more” -> If you do or dont get the number tell her to have a nice day and walk away.

That’s super simple “Basic Guy Game” that will get you comfortable approaching and talking to women. Keep in mind that it doesn’t matter if you got the number! The entire goal at this stage is to simple desensitize yourself to meeting new women and starting conversations.

Once you reach the point where you can do the above while being relatively comfortable its time to start adding in more actual seduction techniques. That’s a post for later…

Make sure you are also working on your fundamentals such as dressing well, having a nice haircut, well groomed and smelling good, working out and not being to fat or to skinny, standing up straight, confident voice, and being able to hold eye contact. The better your fundies are the better responses you will have from women.

Two twin brothers can both approach 100 women using the exact same structure as above but if Twin A has good fundamentals and Twin B has poor fundamentals, Twin A will get much better reactions and have better results. 

At this point I know a lot of guys are going to freak out about the “talking about her” part and wonder what to say. Here are some basic things you can use to get started:  

Ask her about an item of clothing shes wearing and ask her why she chose that or ask her how she arrived at her style of clothing.  You can transition into talking about personality traits.

Ask her about her race and where her family is originally from. From there you can easily transition into talking about travel. 

Ask her what shes out doing. From there you can transition into asking her about what she would rather be doing right now if she could be doing anything with no limitations.

Tell her that she reminds you of a celebrity. Then just name one and even if she looks nothing like her tell her its more of her “energy” that reminds you of said celebrity. Transition to talking about energy and personality or pop culture or tv/movies.

The conversation only has to go on for a few minutes and then go for the number if things are going well. 

You are NOT required to keep talking to women who are boring and dont interest you! Feel free to wish her well and walk away at any point. 

That’s it! Keep doing it until you can be comfortable and not overwhelmed with nerves.",1662304053.0
15,I once knew a militant feminist in college...one of my first lessons of AWALT.,340,x5if8q,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x5if8q/i_once_knew_a_militant_feminist_in_collegeone_of/,58,"Here is the tale of the militant feminist:

When I was in college, the department I was in (where most of my classes were) shared the same building as the Women's Studies department. So inevitably, we had frequent contact with one another. But there was one girl I will never forget...

Now at that time, the Women's Studies (WS) department had a ""club"" where they would collaborate and go to events/talks about the ""patriarchy"" and all that. Their leader was your stereotypical militant feminist type. She had dreads, wore wool beanies, had black rimmed glasses, wore baggy shirts, lip rings, etc. I used to see her around the building but never talked to her. But I could tell there was an intensity about her just from her overall vibe.

So, I had a group of friends that would get together and go out for coffee or drinks a couple times a week or so. Most were working on the same major as I was and there were some WS people sprinkled in. One day, we were having coffee and one of the WS girls brought the ""club leader"" chick along. And holy shit, she was something else. First, when she spoke, she would kind of do a low pitched kind of gruff voice. She had a very tightly wound demeanor and had a very passive aggressive way of speaking (especially to the males in the group). One moment she would be cool and laugh but then her arrogance would take over and she would ""correct"" people. But I will admit that she was highly intelligent and a very quick thinker.

At some point she began talking feminism and was talking about the patriarchy and she despises how women still objectify themselves sexually and all that stuff. She was even saying how she refused to go to clubs because its a disgusting meat market for men and the women get dolled up for men to see them as nothing but ""tits and holes"". Even regular bars were something that she did not like for the same reasons but she made the occasional exception if the vibe was calm and she was with friends.

One thing I did notice though was that she always wore very tight pants (leggings/jeans). She was actually fairly attractive and she did have an ass. But the previous time we hung out, she always said she hated that men should want women for their minds and less so their bodies. She even made a point that she refuses to wear makeup and dresses for that very reason. But she apparently knew she had an ass and consciously wore the tightest pants possible every single day. This was kind of the thing that made me go hmm...

Well, one night we went to the college bar across the street from campus and she came along as well. We were drinking and she started talking again with her low pitched but still loud voice and she even got kind of confrontational with my friend because of stupid ego trips on her part. She had this intense ""I am in charge"" thing going.

So a couple hours later, a group of dudes walk in. They were probably in their 30's. But one of the dudes up front looked like a joke. He was this super skinny white dude that had the Eminem wannabe vibe going. He wore a huge shirt, baggy pants, a big chain necklace, a baseball cap that was on sideways. He even did that slow chicken walk and his eyes were half open and red from weed. My buddy and I saw him and we called him Slim Shady. So Slim Shady at one point walks up to our table and when he talked it was even funnier. He tried so hard to be some thug but it was bad. He seemed like a legit parody, it was hilarious. Anyway, he sees the feminist chick and kind of stares her down and sits next to her (there was an empty seat).

He starts talking to her and I thought, oh shit, this dude is going to have his ass handed to him. So the place is loud and I was sitting at the other end of the table so I really couldn't hear everything. But from the parts I could hear, he was hitting on her and at first she was using her intellect to make him feel stupid and throw power moves. Long story short, Slim Shady was consistent and I started to see that her demeanor changed. She would start giggling, she would do quick touches, and even her voice got way girlier/high pitched. Even her mannerisms and demeanor got more ""dainty"". Well, at one point she got up and went outside to have a cigarette and he followed. They never came back in.

Well, her friend (who was with us) was contacted by her later and told her that she was at the dude's apartment and told her that he was so amazing and the sex was rough. Even going as far as saying, she had to stop at 7 eleven on her way home because she sweat so much that she needed to replace her electrolytes which was funny as hell.

I then see her at school the next week and I walk by her and I look at her to say hi and she just ignored me (like she always did) and had her typical intense look on her face. Later, I saw her speaking in a class and she was back to the ""patriarchy"" and ""women are not sex dolls"" talks again with the low but loud voice. It was something else.  Homeboy had impeccable game and gave me one of my first examples of AWALT.",1662282383.0
16,How a loser gets laid more than some of you,175,x566zd,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x566zd/how_a_loser_gets_laid_more_than_some_of_you/,64,"In light of the influx of posts reeking of insecurity and asking why they can't get laid-- I've decided to detail one of the biggest losers I've worked with.

I used to work at a club and had the honor of working with one of the funniest-walking example of a guy that was a loser by all accounts.

To illustrate this even further- here's an example of the guest of honor:

This guy is a person of color. 
Balding with a receding hairline.
On the spectrum.
Broke all the time, but splurges on only the finest of weed.
Would go out drinking with 10 bucks to his name.
Has 3 kids with 3 different baby mamas.
Drives a shitbox.
Is an objective 6 tops. 

So you have this colorful array of a walking mess getting laid like a warlord. What separates him from some of you is that he *simply does not give a fuck*. Or at least the appearance of it.

He will go up to girls and spout the dumbest, most inane shit possible-- but he will still approach nonetheless. Eventually this guy has amassed some semblance of ""social proof"" by being seen talking and hitting on these poor unsuspecting girls.

Of the girls that have *any* interest, he will escalate and ask if they want to go and smoke with him. Usually at his place. The kicker? He doesn't even have his own place. He lives with his aunt and pays very little for rent. All the while displaying all types of nice guy behavior such as spending what little he has on his extended family.

This fine specimen of a human being is at his prime age (30s) and is still working at a club while being borderline broke. Despite all this, he will still unashamedly try to get laid with girls at the very same club that he works at.

There are many like him in even *worst* circumstances that are still able to get laid. Hell, there are accounts of homeless guys on this subreddit getting laid. I guarantee all of these guys share the same attitude-- they simply do not give a fuck and approach. That's it.

So before you go on your own little soapbox here and start crying about why you can't get laid, despite not even doing the bare minimum (lifting and reading the sidebar!), just recall our prime example right here.

He may not have the best life trajectory-- but he sure as hell has some of you guys beat on body count, albeit certainly not in the best of circumstances.

Some takeaways:

Bare minimum efforts result in bare minimum results.

Have a DGAF attitude.

Approach. You can study all this theory, but unless you actually apply it (the sidebar)-- it all remains theoreticals.

Whatever label you think is holding you back from getting laid, just remember our guest of honor.

Edit: I should also mention that women are *not* a means to an end. For some of you, it's what holds you back from achieving more (or at least foreseen by some of you). Nonetheless, they do help with achieving power if that is your goal.

They unfairly and incorrectly try to place the blame on themselves, maybe I wasn’t emotionally available to her, maybe I wasn’t man enough for her, maybe I was too much man for her. I am here to remind you that this woman was never yours, this goes beyond “she was never yours, it’s just your turn.” A woman that is so easily swayed by another man while with you, you should never take offense or feel slighted by her leaving you. If she’s had partners before you, you shouldn’t concern yourself with reacting at all when this happens. Such a woman will never truly belong to anyone apart from the streets, in a figurative or literal sense this day and age, so we as men must stop crying and and destroying our mental health and physical well being over pussy that doesn’t belong to us and never will.",1662058039.0

Yes, a virgin is preferable for the man who wants to commit and perhaps wife her up and have kids. Virgins pair bond way easier than women with a high body count and we don’t need to go over that fact a million times. Virgins however are a rarity in the western world and the pretty non-westernized ones get married off real quick or they turn into full on whores or they just end up hareming with some other women. Now, if you have to resort to some pre-owned pussy, if that’s your preference fine but don’t force it on your fellow man, find the lowest mileage pussy possible and remember to vet vet vet. Finding a female that’s only had one or at a minimum two sexual partners years apart, either she has self control (rare in modern women), or something is wrong with her mentally or physically. These women also, for lack of a better vocabulary, don’t necessarily have to be *trained* and they fall in like quite agreeably with their man (witnessed with my brother’s second wife and she was 29 when they married).

>What You’re Forgetting

That virgin that you have firmly done your damndest to imprint on, mould into the perfect help-mate, is still a woman. She still thinks like a woman and will still act like a woman. How many men have learned that their high school sweetheart who was blushing and shy on their wedding night, has been getting railed by your brother/best friend/cousin/uncle/father/boss/co-worker/commanding officer (that’s how my brother’s first marriage is ended), because SHE feels like the marriage bed is stale or that she’s missed out on what her perpetually single girlfriends get up to. Modern women especially are very fickle with their emotions and how they *love* and their wants. 


>Never Forget 

Virgins are the best for the man seeking a LTR or perhaps marriage if you like to live dangerously. But, always keep in mind that they’re still women, invest in the virgin but don’t get too invested. She could branch at anytime and this protects the blow from being as devastating as it is for men who haven’t found TRP.",1662067114.0
19,Driving in the Fastlane,294,x2e6ot,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/x2e6ot/driving_in_the_fastlane/,33,"Recently I read the book [The Millionaire Fastlane](https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Fastlane-Crack-Wealth-Lifetime/dp/0984358102) ([summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anJFf9pN16g))

It was pretty decent, the overarching idea of the book was about how you're probably ""driving"" in the safe, slow lane by having a decent job, putting money into your 401k, saving up to buy a house, maybe putting some of that money into index funds. And that in order to realistically become a millionaire, you should quit your job and go all in on starting a business. Ideally while you're still young.

This post is not about the book. In fact, this post is not even about money specifically. It's about this idea of switching into the Fastlane to reach your goals faster and more reliably that I'd like to talk about.

This is a specific issue that many guys don't experience, so if you're one of the lucky ones, this post probably won't resonate as much with you.

# We're all stunted..

If you look at the average person (man or woman), you'll notice that they're really fucking lazy. They only wanna do what they absolutely have to: Go to school/work to make a very mediocre performance   
and then go home as soon as possible to reward themselves for working so hard by playing videogames or scrolling through TikTok. If you're a fellow Gen-Zer that has had internet access during his teen years and got his first phone at 14 (or earlier) you probably suffer from this even more thanks to having your brain fried and re-wired to constantly seek out cheap dopamine from your favorite YouTuber, pornstar or motivational speaker (yes, self-improvement content can be just mental masturbation).

Humans (much like everything in nature) evolved to stick to things that work. You spend 12 hours a day playing videogames while your mom takes care of you and feeds you tendies? Hey, all your subconscious sees is that you're getting well fed and you're even spreading your genes (albeit into the anime bodypillow on your bed)! Better not change this routine that's working for us, what if you fuck it up and we'll die.

# ..stuck in the slow lane..

There's guys that swear they've been hitting the gym 4x a week for the past 3 years and their build looks like they were just rescued from Auschwitz. A big and strong body requires three main ingredients - proper exercise, sleeping and nutrition. All of these three have to be dialed in so you're gaining mass optimally. Guys decide to hit the gym for the first time in their life and so they drag their ass there, do 5 different bicep exercises, eat like shit and then get drunk in the evening. Rinse and repeat. Maybe over time they pick up a proper exercise program, but more often than not, they don't want to track macros, they don't want to sleep optimally because they ""don't have the time"" to commit.

People have a tendency to excuse this kind of behavior because ""at least it's a start"". Yeah it's a start. On the slow lane. You're getting to where you want to be very very slowly, and more importantly, your chances of actually getting there are lower. Anything can happen between now and your destination, so why not make the journey as short as possible so there's less of a time window for random devastating fuckups that could hinder the whole mission?

We're subconsciously afraid of changing things up and commiting to a completely different life routine. Which is also why when newbies stumble upon redpill ideas, they pussyfoot around implementing these ideas, hitting the gym, and doing all the things you have to do. Instead they start asking stupid questions like

* ""Can I get girls if I'm a 5'5"" Indian dude?"" 
* ""Should I even attempt to talk to girls when my jaw is this weak?""
* ""If I work out enough, I won't have to approach girls, they'll just come, right?"" (especially popular take between autistic dudes)

They do this this just to prepare themselves enough. To not hurt themselves too much when they *actually* do go out and try to talk to some girls. And they swear they will, just gotta read through the sidebar one more time bro.

# ..while winners drive past us..

I was a lot like this. My half-assed attempts at improving my life have yielded some results, but it's only after I somehow ended up at a get-together with a handful of very interesting young men. They were three Cambridge University compsci graduates that were also working at Google. Other than having 0.01 percentile IQ, there was one other interesting trait they had.

They asked me to help them with a certain non-profit so I got a chance to work with them. They were **absolutely** in the fast lane. They wasted exactly 0 seconds on useless shit. They were locked in, all in on the non-profit until it was done. And it was done in a matter of months, surprisingly fast and really well. I had never seen anything like this. These three flannel wearing nerds were fucking lions at getting what they wanted and I almost couldn't keep up with their energy.

And they managed to do all this while actually having a life, we went on a trip to Mexico as a form of teambuilding.

I talked to them about it after the fact and I mentioned how they've shown me an approach to things I've never seen before. One of them mentioned that everyone at Google is like this. In order to get into Google, you have to show you've got the ""Google way of thinking"" and that's exactly this proactive, hungry way of getting after what you want.

Ever since then, I've worked with multiple successful startup founders and they all share this common trait.

# ..so become a winner

The whole point of this post is to commit fully. Don't half-ass shit.

If you're going to work out, get a personal trainer or read everything you can about exercise and dial that shit in. From exercise, through macro tracking, to turning down the lights an hour before bedtime. From this point until you get your dream body, you're a bodybuilder. Say that shit to yourself. ""From now on, I'm a bodybuilder"".

If you're shit at socializing, from now on until your goals are met, you're a charismatic extrovert. You're gonna dial that shit in and go out every day. If you work from home, you'll take your laptop and work from a cafe. From now on you're the guy that talks to everyone. Say that shit to yourself and go tell that chick you're passing on the street that you like the way she did her eyeliner.

And keep in mind you can be fully locked on multiple things at once. When you've done your workout and prepared your meals, you still have time in the day to work on your other goals.  

**TLDR: In order to get into the fast lane after your financial, fitness or personal relationship goals, you have to commit fully. Don't ever half-ass anything. You either want it or you don't.**",1661953918.0

I was quite intrigued by it and i thought it may be of interest to post it here.


""The masculine is the source of love.  Surprised?

First, don't confuse tending, a great feminine trait and inclination, with love.

The masculine 'does,' and the feminine is 'done to.'

An integrated man is loving, a Nice Guy tries to be lovable.

Men love women, and women love children.

A boy can be loved by his mother but a grown man cannot be loved by the feminine.

A man can get love from the masculine, mainly his own masculine.

The feminine makes a man's life beautiful and brings him back into nature.

A Nice Guy often seeks love from a women, and makes her into a mother, while still seeking validation from sex. Obviously this can't work.

Nice Guys frequently won't go forth to penetrate the world and experience abundance because they get hung up trying to get loved and validated in a relationship ""first,"" but these relationships don't work as described above.  It's a deadlock--deprivation and neediness maintained because the Nice Guy can't stop checking and testing a mother figure for external validation (reassurance).""",1661768337.0
21,[Success Story/Field Report] FINALLY fucked a hot girl! Thank you so much TRP!!!,123,wzsmcj,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wzsmcj/success_storyfield_report_finally_fucked_a_hot/,50,"(this is a x-post from trp.red. I hope it's allowed. I just wanted to post my story here as well, maybe more people can learn from this) 

I'm 25yo white eurofag, started getting into the manosphere at 17. A bit of social anxiety

I'll spare you of the boring details, there is this shy quiet girl at work. She's a part timer, usually works 1 or 2 days
 a week and rarely talks to anyone. I thought she was pretty cute so I would talk to her from time to time. She would sometimes compliment my arms or something but nothing more.

Eventually I asked her out, I didn't want to be a pussy so I did it face to face, which was kind of difficult with her schedule. The first date didn't go that well in my opinion, we were just talking, I tried some light kino but I thought she really wasn't that interested in me so I didn't ask her out again.

Some more backstory about me, I actually lost my v card earlier this year (I wasn't really attracted to her, but I was desperate and just wanted to get it over with), before that my record was just kissing. So obviously when it comes to sex, I am very inexperienced.

Now cut to last week. I will be quitting this job and I have something else lined up, so I thought - hey why not try again. To my surprise she was really happy to see me again. In my mind she was this shy, innocent girl (oh how wrong I was... ) so I thought there was no possible way of sleeping with her.

Anyways the date goes pretty well, she seemed kinda shy at first, but she kept opening up little by little. I started with some light touches, then joking about sex, she did too and it was at that moment when I realized there is actually a chance.

We went to a park, sat down on a bench, I was showing her some photos on my phone, gently brushing her arm whatever.

Then she started holding hands with me. Oh shit. Suddenly she starts throwing shit tests at me - are you single, when was your last relationship, etc etc. I have done this hundreds of times.

I kiss her and she drops the bomb. ""We can go to your place after this, right? "" oohhhh shit. Did she just say that? I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

I was a little too excited... My first hookup! With a hot girl nonetheless!!! Guys, this girl was EXACTLY my type. Petite, Asian, short hair, 100lbs soaking wet. Really pretty.

At this point I was a little too excited. I started kissing her, and she clearly didn't like that. So I backed away.

We get to my place, and because I was not expecting this at all, it was dirty as hell. I apologize to her and ask her if she can wait in the bathroom for a moment. She obliged and my heart is racing as I'm speedrunning this shit in 90 seconds. Apparently it was good enough, she lays down on my bed (BTW I have 2 roommates so one more reason to be anxious. Fortunately they were all away at the time)

I started undressing her, some foreplay, I don't want to make this into a porn story, you guys get the idea.

I ask if she can go down on me, she says yes but you need to wear a condom. I thought it was kind of weird but whatever. Rubber BJ beats no BJ.

Then she gets on top. OH MY FUCKING GOD!!! This girl was freaky as hell!!! She was thrusting herself on me and I was worried she would snap my dick in half.

Because she was so hot I got really into it, I was going so hard my whole body was covered in sweat. I have never been so sweaty in my life. Not even after the most hardcore gym session.

Unfortunately I gave myself a death grip from watching way too much porn, so I couldn't cum but at least I made her cum. It was so crazy, her whole body was convulsing. She was so loud, it was like watching porn on full volume.

Cue another shit test - how many girls you've been with, blah blah blah. I said ""I stopped counting. More than 20 but less than 200"" ""really? You must have so many STDs"" ""yeah, it's like Pokémon. Gotta catch them all.""

I said some beta shit, which probably ruined my chances of hookup #2, but I really didn't care at that point. That was more than good enough for me.

I still can't believe it happened... It was like lucid dreaming. My fantasy come true. Absolutely surreal experience

This was such a massive confidence boost for me. Knowing I have the ability to pull hot chicks, I felt like a king of the world.

Big thanks to the TRP community. Whisper, Uncle V, GLO, Rollo, Dr Warlock and many others. You made my dream come true.

This shit really works. BTW to all the Indian guys - I'm 5 foot 7. If I could do it, you can do it too.",1661683956.0

I have declined and they persisted. I said I'm dating a girl right now. This is half true as we've only been on a few dates.

The single Mom; 

-Doesn't have anytime because she puts her kids first.

-Is Overweight. 

-Goes to school, and isn't working. 

-Uses an Alias so one of the Baby Daddy's can't find her.

-Lives with family on a property. 
-etc.

They think I'm a great catch. Good to know... so why try to set me up with this hot mess? 🙄

Compare this to the girl I've gone on a few dates with;

-Has her own house.

-Works.

-Has time to date. 

-Is in decent shape.

-Paid for a few dates. 

It is frustrating to think that some believe that a single mom like this is such a great catch. And I'm going to jump at the chance to date her? 😄🤦🏽‍♂️

I haven't had the best luck dating... but damn. They think I'm going to waste time with the single mom over this current chick? Hell no!

I'm in decent shape, have a good job, own place, I'm fairly attractive, good family, etc. The average American man like me does NOT want to wreck his life by dating a single mom. 

Why is that so hard to understand?

UPDATE - All you saying bang her. Hell nah! 

My time is valuable and I'm not going to waste it. If it fails, which it would, I'll get blamed. 

My friend knows this is a terrible match for me. He's only gone along with it since his wife is pushing it.

UPDATE 2 - The last girl they set me up with pushed me to RP and self development actually. 

That relationship totally f*cked me up for a long time.

UPDATE 3 - I told them ""Thanks, but no thanks."" several times.

Every once in a while, some new hyper masculine cock enters the public eye, and all the recovering betas here cannot help but latch onto the new thing that their enemies hate and wrapping their lips around it for a good hard suck. 

If bravado was the Red Pill, why does the Red Pill exist? If thuggish behaviour and pissing everyone off intentionally was so good, why are half the thugs you know either convicts or ex convicts They got laid, so I guess that 2 year dry spell with probation is the price you pay?

Why? Because acting like a thug are none of these things, they are shit, they always were shit, and it's very easy for slaves to replace one master with another. Tate and the 'be like me it worked for me' men online do not give a shit about your welfare. They are just using your insecurity in a marketing funnel to make money. They aren't sincere genuine people, they are curated brands, saying the right things to resonate with an audience desperate to give money so they can feel good.

Men who aren't raised by other men have a chariacture of masculinity they base off of TV, and seeing what the people who hate them hate. Feminists hate men, right? Feminists hate Tate, right? Therefore Tate is dad 2.0! The enemy of your enemy is not your friend, he's just your enemy's enemy. Nothing less and nothing more.

They don't give a fuck about you. They just want you paying them instead of someone else. Tradcons and feminists can fight their little war over whose plan to exploit you for women's sake is ""better"", the thugs can catch whoever doesn't fall into either camp but is still longing for leadership, and you don't have to be involved. Because if you actually take the Red Pill, instead of just longing for a high-T 1990s wrestling promo, then this what you already know:

You belong to you.
You exist for you.
Anyone who wants something from you had better offer you something in exchange, instead of trying to convince you it's cool.
Because being against what you hate doesn't mean you have frame, it means you're reactive and still controlled.
And if you buy into it when it hurts you, you're a fucking tool.
If you are still looking for someone to worship, you're still in beta-male suck-up mode.
Yes, that includes Jesus. If he loves you so much, why does he never pick up the phone and call?

The hate of Andrew Tate by the ""redpiller"" is a great example of this. It's sad because new redpiller will not see the truth of what it takes to be a masculine figure; bad information is being upvoted and great information is being downvoted. 

Andrew Tate is that of what every true masculine man should strive to be. Strong physically & mentally, rich, abundance of women, integrity, charisma, Freedom of speech, speaking of what's in your mind through the lens of a masculine man, but its now all forbidden. But yet feminist man hating cardio b promoters are socially acceptable. 

""But Andrew Tate is a rapist, human trafficker, misogynist, and wife beater.""
ALL of those are proven false with evidence found all over the internet, yet incels of the red pill still believes every ounce of it because they're too lazy to do the research. I guess being grouped in the masses of sheep's and chodes is easier than becoming a man. 
His women came out with a video explaining the ""beating"". The police and video evidence of surveillance cameras clearly shows the women coming in the house and staying through her own will, she was never kidnapped. Saying men and women are different is being a realists not misogynist. And rapists??? No I did not pay a single penny to Andrew. Not his HU or war room. I simply analyze and made my own judgements. A lost art in this new generation.


The truth is... I feel bad for the newer generation of men wanting to learn red pill and any parts of masculinity because it is all being WATERED DOWN. Watered down by chodes who have zero experience with women and life. Broke boys who can't afford to support an aesthetic physique. Newer and less experience men will be misguided when bad information gets upvoted by the sheep's.  Even in a forum like this that promotes masculinity, it is such a shame.

You know how it is with movies and shows these days.
 
Wokism and white knighting everywhere.

The finale of Better Call Saul was no exception. I liked the show, but I hated the finale - and not only for the wokism. It was generally incoherent. They didn't manage to tie up all the strings.

So, I changed it.

I couldn't do much about the incoherence, but at least I removed the simping. 

How?

There's a way in the VLC video player to have a playlist with start and end times. Using it, you can cut out parts, or even rearrange scenes.

You can find my playlist here: 

https://theempressisnaked.wordpress.com/2022/08/24/better-call-saul-adams-cut-the-finale-without-the-white-knighting/

I'm not giving a file, to ease worries about viruses etc. Just copy paste the few lines, paste them in a text editor, change the name of the file to your own finale episode filename, and save it as finale.m3u

If you've seen the finale already, you can use my cut to show it e.g. to your children, and spare them the woke brainwashing.

--------

Almost all the shows that go out nowadays are unwatchable due to their hard feminist political line. I expect the same with e.g. the upcoming Lord of the Rings adaptation. Why not do our own montage, and enjoy the story our way? 

Now, is this kind of arbitrary? 

Not really. 

Think of it as an alternative  ""Director's cut"". As ""Adam's Cut"". 

In fact, I propose we adopt this term for edited versions of films that do away with the gynocentric propaganda of the ""me too"" era. Considering practically all forthcoming productions are going to be chock full of woke propaganda, this might be the time to start a movement. 

So, go ahead and do your own ""Adam's cut"" of your favorite movie or series.

-------

**SPOILERS follow**

For the ""Adam's cut"" of the Better Call Saul finale, I've done minimal editing, cutting out some parts. In the producers' cut, Saul sacrifices himself for Kim, a cliche finale - in this and every other era, really. In the version I provide, he gets off lightly, as was his initial plan - and there is a hint that Kim might even wait for him to get out of prison. And we leave it at that. 

Isn't is much better than sacrificing himself for his accomplice, just because she's a woman?

sezamus, 31, ex-military, engineer earning top 10% salary in my country. I have my own flat, car and... 30% body fat. Yes, I got back to my gym after almost a year.  


I have a friend, former bikini-fitness model. \~5'9"", great shape, great boobs, very nice personality.  
One day we were coming home from a dance class and she was telling me how some guys there were sometimes rude beyond comprehension.   
A sperg, who got to know some PUA technique called ""Neg"" (I believe you are familiar with it), used it like that:  
**Her**:-Hi!  
**Sperg**:-Hi... You're fat!  
Then, she told me how cringe it was and never wanted to see that guy ever again.

To my surprise it is not the first time, I hear about misuse of neg.   
Once I was on a date with a beautiful young woman (23), who knew how pretty she was and what effect it had on men. During the talk I complemented how nice outfit she had worn for me. She smiled, asked ""where are you looking at? Eyes up here!"" in a teasing way and told me, that some guy who had tried to go on a date with her also had thrown a spergy neg like ""oh, you are not pretty sitting that close"". Of course the result was the same. She never wanted to see that guy again.  


Both that girl and my friend said the same: ""Men became rude lately!""  
I know why. It was inevitable. They had read it about it here or in some PUA community, but understood it in an absolutely wrong way. Guess what? I made that same mistake many years ago. I called a pretty girl ""a witch"". She didn't take that well.  
Guys, seduction is not about being rude.  
The purpose of an accurate neg is to create playful teasing, to joke, show self-confidence after you have some rapport with a woman.   
E.g.  
Her: -Last weekend I did this, that and...

28,Exploring masculinity and creativity,7,wvkoda,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wvkoda/exploring_masculinity_and_creativity/,19,"Feel free to delete this post if it doesn't fit the sub's standards. I understand a majority of posts on this sub have gone down in quality and I'd hate to contribute to it.

I'm a 22m, and have been introduced to trp for a little over a year now. I have made significant improvements in most parts of my life since then, but there has been one significant problem that's been a bit intimidating to me.

I'm a musician. I love writing music, and am fortunate enough to call it my work. The type of music I write, however, is very calm, meditative, reflective, and also a bit mellow (I'm going to have a couple examples similar to my writing style at the end of this post that I urge you to listen to. They're very beautiful pieces of music). A friend of mine described it as ""pretty music that feels like a nice hug"".

The problem is that through all these years I've used music as a tool for expressing my pain and anger- I was always emotionally volatile until very recently when I started exploring stoicism and becoming more in control of my emotions. I am now very capable of controlling my reaction to things, but because of this my approach to writing music has changed and I don't know how I can overcome it. I don't feel emotions to the same intensity that used to drive me to pick up a guitar or touch a piano and find a way to express them anymore. 

As an artist, I feel it is my duty to reflect how I view the world as accurately as I can- and if everything isn't as emotionally strong to induce a similar reaction in the listener when experiencing it, my work will not only get boring but my aim to provoke any kind of response to it would have failed.

 I haven't released any music for the last 7 months because primarily I was focusing on finishing university, but I was also just lost because of this. I couldn't even go to my professors for help, because they're all grown children. Every week or so I get a dm from someone new asking when I'd be releasing something new, and my desire to continue making music is stronger than ever. My purpose is to keep creating ""pretty music"" that offers whoever is experiencing it a place of comfort and the ability to reflect on stuff, but that has been challenging for me because the requirement for this is to experience emotions very strongly for a long period of time- long enough to finish writing something. 

And I can't do that anymore. I usually just meditate or go workout, sometimes I journal, and I move on. I am also an actor, so maybe if this shit doesn't work at the end of the day I can just pretend to be a different person and try writing- but then it wouldn't be genuine. I have no urgency to make this change- all my work is ""creative"" work but it's going okay. I have the luxury of time. This is just another obstacle I have to get through as I keep growing, and in time, I will.

My aim for this post is to create a discussion around current artists/creators who are ""masculine"" (or at least fit your description of it), because at least in my little bubble I feel there's a lack of those. It would also be cool hearing other people on this sub who are more experienced in the arts than me to give their two cents. Or maybe I just need one of you to kick me in the ass and call me stupid for even thinking this and get on with writing, because at the end of the day this *is* a writer's block.

Thank you for reading this post.

Here's a few songs I've been listening to a lot lately that I feel are similar to my writing style, and the type of music I'm drawn towards writing and exploring:

29,[FIELD REPORT] My first cold approach ever. Come laugh at my cringe.,112,wuben1,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wuben1/field_report_my_first_cold_approach_ever_come/,34,"It’s been a year since I started cold approach so I thought about writing a different kind of field report today. I’m going to post my first approach ever. My god, just writing this FR makes me cringe from embarrassment. I was fucking bad at this back then, but hey, we all start somewhere right?

I started cold approach a year ago because I was extremely displeased with my nonexistent dating life back then to a point where I was borderline depressed. All other aspects of my life were pretty great. I was fit, educated, good career, high income, just moved back to my hometown where my family and friends are. Yet, I was struggling with girls immensely. It irritated the hell out of me. I did everything society told me to do and, yet there I was, with no prospects. OLD was complete garbage for me as it has been for the last 8 years. I tried social circle game by going to meetup groups and hiphop dance classes. Essentially a waste of time if you’re trying to meet girls. I had a choice to make: keep doing the same things or make a change and take massive action. I chose the latter.

I’ve always known about cold approach/PUA, however, I was always too afraid to try it. My first “session” was at the mall. I went to the mall with the sole intention of cold approaching girls. I even thought of and practiced the opening line: “Hey, excuse me, I saw you from afar and thought you were extremely gorgeous and just thought to myself that I have to meet that girl or I'll regret it for the rest of my life” LOL… ugh so cringe. Anyways, I got to the mall and spent 2-3 hours trying to approach girls. Guess what? I couldn’t do it. I was too fucking scared. The most I did that day was ask a girl where X store was. I spent 2-3 hours at the mall walking around like a clown only to ask a girl where X store was. Big clown energy. I know. So I didn’t even count that as an approach. I left the mall that day and was thinking “fuck, this is fucking hard. How am I ever gonna do this?”.

A few days later, I went to a minigolf meetup event. It was so lame and such a waste of time. As always, it was a sausage fest, there were barely any girls, and when there were girls, they weren’t attractive. After the event, as I was leaving, I saw this girl working at an empty ziplining store. She wasn’t even that attractive tbh but I was like, this is it, I need to fucking approach. There’s nobody else around so there won’t be any public humiliation. I legit walked past the store back and forth like 2 times before I went inside for the approach. I was so fucking nervous. My heart was pounding, it felt like it was going at 150bpm. I even had to take a seat at a bench to collect myself before going inside. I finally mustered up the courage for the approach after like 5-10 minutes of pondering and preparing my opening line. I went inside and instead of leading with my opener, I froze and just started asking her about ziplining LMAO. After like 60 seconds of inquiring about ziplining, I said, “Actually, I don’t really care about ziplining. I was walking by and I saw you and thought you were kinda cute and wanted to meet you. So I thought to come in to say hello and see if you’re single”. She responded with “oh sorry I have a boyfriend” to which I responded with “oh okay, well he’s a lucky guy”.  LMAO. Jesus christ, just end me.

So that was my first cold approach ever. I actually walked away from that approach feeling pretty good. I was just happy I did an approach, however, I didn’t find the surge of motivation to get serious with cold approach until after my first night game session (you can read about that under my post history). 

That was all a year ago. I can definitely say that I'm the most confident I've ever been with women at this point of my life. A comparison I like to think about is during 2019, I remember trying to escalate on a girl during a date and my heart was racing. Now, I'm cool as a cucumber when I interaction and escalate with girls. I’ve learned so much in the last year, made new friends, met thousands of girls, hooked up with dozens, made out with hundreds. Here’s to another year of pimping.",1661118768.0
30,What’s the end game,72,wub35t,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wub35t/whats_the_end_game/,35,"Heya dudes

I had a lurking period on this subReddit a while back when I went through my whole “taking the red pill moment” but I don’t come here as often anymore. 

I assume it’s because when we went through our moments, we learnt and applied.

(God, I thought I had learnt and cracked the code to life when I first got into bed with a girl!)

However, when I look now at some of the posts on this page, I feel we may have forgotten what the end game is. The end game isn’t more sex, more plates or more indifference to rejection. 

The end game is understanding who we are, to put us on a pursuit which will continue to keep us on our toes. It is a pursuit which continues regardless of how we evolve, because we continue to strive to be better. Nobody sits down after a massive cut and thinks “wow I guess I’ll just maintain this physique from now on”. 

Same for your career, sex life, and overall well being. 

I saw a video recently - I can’t place who was talking about this but I’ll try to paraphrase what the idea was:

If your end game is to have more sex and meet women, you will end your pursuit of self-betterment as soon as you achieve such things. 

When I started on my red pill journey, I honestly only wanted more sex and validation from women. 

I ate 2000 cals a day, and ran 10km every single day I could, to lose 20kg overall. The bottom line is that the wise men on this group taught me about being lean, game, and much more. And I learnt, and applied! 

I went through a super cool renewed-version-of-me summer but I felt empty because I had never had the attention and love of a woman. And thus, I dove head first into a relationship. 

It was good for a while but I treated this woman like garbage for close to a year and a half because I didn’t think you could be any other way with a long term partner. I honestly regret how I was. 

But I had love and attention, so I had finally achieved what I wanted when I first came to this sub. 

I then got complacent. 

I got fat, I started drinking everyday, I became lazy and lost sight of my own future. 

In essence, I forgot what the red pill had taught me because I had achieved what I thought the red pill would bring me. 

Which brings me to question of what the red pill really teaches us. 

On a surface level, the red pill brutalises the concept of increasing personal value to achieve a better sex life. I think it’s incredibly effective - I’m not complaining. It dramatically changed the course of my life (judging from how the past three years have been)

However, the deeper idea in taking the red pill, I would contend, is:

1) to put us all in a journey where we self-analyse and attempt to better ourselves. 

2) understand our own flaws, and work on them. 

3) learn how both items above massively impact the rest of our lives. 

If you’re a dude in the lurking phase, learning what the red pill is, please go out and try every fucking thing your brothers talk about here. You will learn so much about people. 

If you already went through a journey of self betterment, and have achieved your short term goals, please remember what the red pill teaches you. 

Don’t get lost and fall prey to habit once you achieve what you came here for. 

The pursuit of self must always continue. The rest always follows.",1661117971.0
31,Modern dating is just fucking for older women,316,wty00q,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wty00q/modern_dating_is_just_fucking_for_older_women/,107,"**A woman new on the dating app scene** will be enamored by the attention- so many options, often exceeding her wildest fantasies. A gym-rat in his early-thirties, looking to relieve a bit of stress after leaving the office; the twenty-four year old bartender; the frat guy cheating on his teenage girlfriend; everyone vapid and interchangeable- all chasing a woman over forty. She always knew she could do better than her husband- and with the maturity of age, now she’s comfortable enough with her sexuality to indulge without regret.

And even if she had more fun than she ever thought were possible on those lonely nights, sitting under the glow of her television, with an open bottle of wine, playing and replaying the eventual conversation she’d need to have with her husband; even if she had gotten to live out the female version of every man’s fantasy, with the only limit being a time predestined by her own genetic code, a threshold causing the attention to taper- she’ll one day realize that coldness had always surrounded her, even if she couldn’t always feel it.

**\[Excerpt from:** [**WELCOME TO HELL**](https://www.amazon.com/Welcome-Hell-Bad-Billy-Pratt/dp/195189751X)**\]**

**Lesson:** I thought of my poor old Dad last night when talking to a female friend about a friend of hers who's been ""doing the dating app"" thing after she'd gone through her divorce. Part of it has been great- men everywhere! Taking her out! Taking her on vacations! Dinners! Wineries! Sexy young men! Wealthy older men! 

She had felt so lousy and dejected after her divorce that all the attention had made her feel like she was in college again.

That's part of it.

The other part is that **she drinks more than she ever has and cries just as much.** After every conversation about *keeping things causal*; after every text she gets the next morning, *last night was great but I don't think we have chemistry*, despite him fucking until the blue chew wore off... It's the same story, every single time, and now she expects it like clockwork.

I thought of my poor old Dad last night, the time he explained to me, as a teenager, that none of the girls I was palling around with on the phone- on school nights, as they'd gossip about boys they liked- were actually going to be *my girlfriend*. They were just using me...

As I explained to my friend, about her girlfriend using these dating apps. **None of these guys will want her to be their girlfriend.**

Funny how it switches like that.",1661083464.0
32,Social norms favors women too much,164,wt03qx,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wt03qx/social_norms_favors_women_too_much/,66,"In today's society the most important thing to relationships is being sexually loyal, while emotional loyalty is not needed, and in many ways considered irrational. 

Emotional loyalty is harder for women to do, but it is only fair they do something hard if they want to force the man to face something hard too. 

Someone not liking bacon telling their partner to not eat bacon aren't on the same playing field. A woman naturally has less sex drive, and her sex drive in most cases is tied to her emotions. So mindless random sex to the woman is something easy to avoid if they are emotionally happy, but the way men work it is much harder and takes an actual toll not to indulge in desire (same toll as not having a close opposite gender  friend, or more emotional outlets in general) 

In the past patriarchy and religion had it right in some way, it forced sexual jail on people, but at least it forced women to endure emotional jail. in a perfect world we wouldn't need any jail, but having both jails is better than sexual jail being the only thing to exist.  I hate patriarchy, I hate religion but I hate feminism more than both. Religion in sex negative, so is feminism. 

Considering this it makes perfect sense to forbid women who want monogamy from having close friends of the other gender, but it today's society it is considered controlling to expect what is only fair. 

I am not red pill btw, I disagree with many of the RP ideas but this subreddit seems one of the few places I can leave this rant in.",1660976515.0

Field Report,180,wrpl9a,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wrpl9a/i_lost_my_virginity_last_night_field_report/,107,"I (M22) was invited to an F29's house at 9pm last night. I had never met this woman before so it was quite bizarre that she was willing to give her address to a complete stranger.

I met this woman off a dating app, and interestingly her profile said she was looking for ""chatting / friendship"" only,

She is Mexican and didn't speak English very fluently, so we communicated through Google Translator on her phone. I think we both enjoyed this since it was a different way to communicate.

I never once touched her without approval beforehand, which built trust between us greatly and was definitely one of the most important factors at play.

Body language was also extremely important, as she insisted on sitting beside me in her home to the point where she was breathing on me, and kept moving her leg to touch mine. Sometimes I would purposely move away and she would close the distance.

There was a lot of last minute hesitation because I was a complete stranger she had just met and was 7 years younger than her, but I focused on positive reinforcement and making her feel good to get over the concerns.

I was extremely blunt and forwards with the things I typed in to her translator. Like I didn't waste time at all I just told her exactly how I felt and what I wanted to happen. A lot of the stuff I said would probably be quite creepy if she didn't find me attractive, but I was already aware that she liked me so I was okay with my word choices.

She had some roommates so we blasted Stranger Things season 3 and Squid Game to mask the noise. We showered together after. The best part of it all was no longer being touch starved and having a cuddle buddy.",1660844047.0
34,By all means redpill doesn't mean a man has low Integrity and dignity where they just pump n dump women,19,wlhozs,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wlhozs/by_all_means_redpill_doesnt_mean_a_man_has_low/,65,"https://youtu.be/DGbf-aK3YxU 

Something that caught my attention about redpill they seem to have good points on self improvement, However I feel like they have low value standards when it comes to sex.

We are creating what we make the world to be everyday, I would like to live in a world where a man and women are virgins till marriage as it is important to each other

 A world where porn doesn't exist

As much as that utopia would be nice to have such high values, the world is unfair and it won't really go that way

Most of us have been numb thinking it's alright or we're used to all that sex culture drug culture drinking culture etc

It's not really the best choice out there for our happiness longterm.

Alright let's take an example since most of you won't really get what I'm pointing at.

Is it really alright for you guys to have your mom to have a bunch of strangers dicks in her mouth/pussy/ass, before your dad and you being born? or even after your born?

Or what about your daughter /  gran ma/  sis / aunt family etc

Of course not, most of you wouldn't find it ideal,

 Why would you do that to someone else's mom / daughter /  gran ma/  sis / aunt family etc

Or what about your daughter /  gran ma/  sis / aunt family etc ? 

Our brain's have been getting insensitive/desensitized to such stuff, our brain receptors dopmaine/sertonin whatever centers are being fried, drugs make you think like your on to something or your right but it damages your outview, critical thinking, makes you think your right and you choose these decisions consciously when your not, Even if it's a little intake.

That's scary that it impairs you for long that it might take years for you to get that your in that spot, and neither is the cult that we're in is even helping progress on any of this.

I mean basically we lost our common sense on what's normal, and let me be clear this is very abnormal and immoral, but that's what the world seems to be turning into sadly.

That's my 2cents, and of course nice guys never really get rewarded, just as the good girls that are into self improvement get taken advantaged off, unless if either side is lucky.

Hoping this message is a seed to make this world a better place for us all, to look out for each other and make a safer healthier world.

Thank you for reading.

Edit: I'd like to drop this link as i feel porn affects are very underrated longterm for true clean bonding/intimacy between two https://youtu.be/hzPylqS01qU?t=511

Edit: As for women, a man cannot do this alone, this message has to be passed to them too, I hope a woman out there does seed a message like this to them too.",1660190168.0
35,MINDSET - Part II of Inner Game,233,wk8vuq,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/wk8vuq/mindset_part_ii_of_inner_game/,22,"Dear reader,

I'm gonna call you a loser here and there. That's only because you are one :)  
Get offended by that, and use it as a fuel to become better. Anyway.

Mindset is everything. As i mentioned previously you cannot change the things that happen to you, but you can change how you react to them. In fact, the only thing you can change is your mindset. Everything else is outside of your power.

This post, unlike the previous one, will focus on things you can do right now to have a better mindset. And it won’t be too long because i shortened the list for one reason: INTERNALIZE.

Because you can read all you want, until you start implementing the things i write you will still be in the same spot. Same person. Here we go.  


* **The Basics**
   * Sleep, drinking water, eating enough (not too little nor too much). Don't do drugs, cut the alcohol to the minimum (don’t get hammered every day). Take care of yourself physically. The brain is an organ after all. Meditate, journal. Find a hobby. Have a social life. Stop watching porn.
* **I can do anything i want**
   * Believe it. You can achieve everything if you put your mind to it. You can become the best at everything as long as you work for it. Remember that, internalize it. You can achieve whatever you want.
* **I am responsible for my life**
   * God won’t give you wings, he won’t make you a billionaire while you lay in bed watching “Friends”. The fuck are you doing you loser? Is this the life you want? Is this the life you dream about? Nobody is going to change your life. Get up and do it yourself. Get pissed off at your current situation. Why don't you have a Lambo? Why do some guys have 10 girls and you have none? Get angry. Change your life. Nobody else will do it for you.
* **Your word is your command**
   * If you say something you better do it. If you said ""I will go to the gym today"", you no must go to the gym. Whatever you say you have to do it. Using this principle, you can now just say stuff you know you should do but are ""tired"" or ""lazy"". Now you have to do them. I am going to approach 5 girls today. And you HAVE to do it. Because your word is set in stone. You cannot back off now that it was spoken into existence. I will build a business, and now you have to work for it to build it. Simple right? There is your motivation right there. Never lying to yourself. Staying true to your word.
* **Know your enemy**
   * When you don’t go to the gym, your enemy does. When you don’t approach a girl your enemy approaches her. In the end, he is jacked & has a 10/10 sucking him off. And you are alone at home with a beer belly. Think about it. Everytime you don’t do it. Your parallel universe YOU does it. Do you wanna live in the “success” universe, or in the “loser” universe?
* **“I know that i know nothing”**
   * Shut up. Oftentimes people just talk too much. Bragging, and talking their mouths off about things they already know. Shut up and listen. You can learn from anyone. Realize that you know nothing, even if you know everything. Still be willing to listen, learn, explore.
* **I AM ALIVE**
   * Scientists say the odds of you being born are at least 1 in 400 trillion. Why are you wasting your opportunity being a loser? You just won a lottery, you got the gift life. Use it.
* **Don’t take yourself so seriously**
   * Self explanatory. Life is fun. Girls are fun. Sex is fun. Have fun. Stop thinking so much.
* **Don’t chase happiness. Understand your emotions.**
   * Chasing happiness is the worst. Why do you want it? You don’t chase anger all the time. Anger is also an emotion. If you were happy with your life you would get nowhere. You would just lay down, happy, with a smile. Fat and useless. You should be angry you don't have a life you want and deserve. Make a dent in the universe. Use emotions, use anger, to achieve greatness. Like with women, if you chase emotions you will never reach them. So don’t strive for happiness, strive to live your life to the fullest of your ability. Live in the present. Meditate. Don’t chase anything. Be content with the present moment. Ask yourself, why do i feel this emotion? And find the source. Maybe because you were a pussy and did not approach that girl on a bus. Or maybe you feel kinda awesome because you did approach her adn got a number. Rewire the negative thoughts as soon as they pop up in your head. Have hobbies and a social life. Negative emotions are a  response to not fulfilling your true potential.
* **Ooh La Laaaaa**
   * In the book of pook there is a post named like that. What do you think of when you see a hot girl? “Will she like me” “Do i look good” “Is my hair good” “I’m not at her level” ""Bla bla bla"". FUCK THAT. Ooh La Laaaa is what you think. No thoughts of self doubt. Accept your masculinity. This helped me a lot during my learning. Think of her as a hot girl, which she is. And adopt the mindset that every girl in this world loves you. They probably don't love you, but you thinking that they do is what is important.
* **Learn what gets you into a FLOW state of mind**
   * Flow is when time passes by quickly. When everything you say or do is perfect. It matches with your energy and with YOU. Google “flow state”, do some homework.
* **Discovery**
   * “Finding yourself”, as cliche as it sounds, is a real thing. How many of you know what they want out of life? What is your “frame” of life? Find your values, your principles. Stick to them. What are your  goals… Find your frame. What do you like and dislike, state your opinion, discover your OWN opinion on things. Don’t read it on reddit and adopt it as your own. Form it yourself.
* **Write down your goals**
   * I’m not going to write how to do this. Read the above things. You can achieve everything now, and you know that you want to live in a “success” universe. What does that universe look like? If you could achieve everything and anything, what would you want to achieve?
* **Be grateful**
   * As stupid as it sounds, writing a gratitude journal will help tremendously. Start writing one as soon as you wake up. And you will notice that after a month, you wake up feeling awesome. Feeling grateful. I hate mornings. If you speak to me before i get my coffee i will litteraly break your nose. But since i started doing this. I woke up feeling great. My mindset shifted to things i am grateful about and happy about. Try it yourself.

*(instagram:* ***@ captainmorpheus*** *- i will publish an ebook about inner & middle game (middle game being something new i see nobody is teaching!! ). Don't miss out).* 

I finally sat down and wrote this. I can expand a lot on mindset. But this are some ""core"" principles. If you men like this post i will write another one. Introducing Middle Game concept, which i really think is the best way to learn game. Anyway. Let me know in comments. 

Love, 

Your QuantumShit00.

P.S.   
\- Do 30 squats before proceeding!  
\- Do 20x3 pushups every morning from now on (say it out loud so you have to do them)  
\- Drink more water.  
\- Read a non-fiction book every morning for 10 minutes instead of looking at the phone.  
\- Every day, do one thing you are ""SCARED"" to do (approach a girl, cold shower, compliment a cashier...)  
\- Download [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and learn to use it. You can choose a template where you can track goals & tasks. You can also journal in there, take notes, write and stuff. I just started using it. It helps organize your day so you can stop being a loser. Do all the above and track it in notion.",1660065228.0

Listening to rap music. Rap music has more narcissists than any genre. It promotes terrible things and the culture is very degenerated. If you want a happy relationship, someone who listens to rap is more likely to be promiscuous, have a drug problem, and more. Many people who listen to rap tend to be depressed and have no purpose in life.
Next is body modifications like colored hair, tattoos, and excess piercings. This is a sign that they are un happy with who they are, or they follow trends to fit in or they want to stand out which means they lack self esteem. Its ok to stand out through exceptional achievements and ability, but changing appearance in a way other than hard work like exercise is usually not healthy. 


More red flags

Each additional partner means the last relationship failed, meaning they pick bad partners; bad decision making or keep making mistakes in the relationship that got them broken up with


What to look for in a man


If they play video games it's a massive red flag. They probably have no purpose, goals, or ambition, which is why they waste their time. They need purpose and ambition. Drive to achieve something worthy. They need good morals and to be competent; smart and able to work hard and succeed. Something that you would love to see him achieve. Something you want him to achieve.


What to look for in a woman


Does she go to college? If she does, a family is not her priority. She will also have debt, be brainwashed by the agenda of the colleges, and be influenced by the common degeneracy of college culture. A woman should have kids while she is most fertile; in her prime. If she goes to college and has a career, she isn’t planning to have kids until she is past the wall, or her girls will only be half of her attention.

At any time, for any reason or maybe for no reason at all, women can and will discard you faster than a three-month-old fetus doomed to rot in a Planned Parenthood dumpster. As flies crawl out from its hollow eye sockets, its mother sings the song of the Strong Independent Woman. That's the cost of keeping wages low and Clown World running. That's the cost everyone is willing to pay. You can bet your student loans on it.


She doesn't love you; she loves the idea of you. She will coat-hanger you out of her life at the earliest emotional, social or economic convenience. Techno-Capital has reduced women into fragmented husks who float from desire to desire with the lucidity of a schizophrenic subway masturbator. Deleuze and Guattari foresaw the arrival of our current predicament in the 1970s. The contemporary woman is a [disorganized, unregulated Body Without Organs adrift in a sea of Capital](https://i.imgur.com/iV9VY5f.jpg) bereft of internal logic or consistency. No amount of lukewarm stoicism or self-help porridge is going to change this basic socio-economic fact. No amount of defensive oedipalization aka gender role reenactment can quench a contemporary women's thirst for annihilation on the altar of pharmaceuticals, social media and career.


Optimism is for cowards. It takes courage to understand contemporary women and realize their problems are not of your doing, despite the projections to the contrary. It's not your fault that her negligent alcoholic father slumbered in his own piss unable to provide desperately needed love to his crying daughter in 2003. You can't change what happened. Nor can you fix what happened, because she enjoys her symptoms too much to let you. The best you can hope for is to joyride her naked body down the slippery corpse of Western civilization. This isn't about dominating women and making them submit, as there is no merit in vanquishing people forsaken by their own God. This is about doing the best with what you're given, which is to say a [psychologically unstable woman and a society in precipitous decline.](https://i.imgur.com/CV1gkzi.jpg)


**Extract The Maximum Amount of Sex Out Of Women**

The modern woman is in your life for a good time not a long time, which is why it's imperative for you to extract as much sex as possible while she remains in your company. Think of her as a leased oil well in a third world country and yourself as a Chinese Petroleum corporation specializing in maximum exploitation, deep drilling and environmental negligence. Rather than wasting time in redundancy repeatedly imitating empathy and compassion on first dates, cut costs and maximize profit by extracting more sex per woman. When you're opportunistically dick-drilling the mentally damaged (aren't they all at this point) you need to maximize profit by going as deep and as hard as possible during your limited window of opportunity.


When you blindly outsource the burdensome task of mate selection to the posthuman cybernetic entity that is the Tinder algorithm, sometimes you have the pleasure of meeting a woman whose [medicine cabinet and night stand are overflowing with prescription pills](https://i.imgur.com/TlUipOf.jpg). With great risk comes great reward. The pharmacological deterritorialization that makes her a great lay also makes her a danger to yourself and others. When sleeping with these kinds of women DO NOT SLEEP. These people absolutely cannot be trusted around your vulnerable naked sleeping body. Take a page out of the Wehrmacht's playbook and use powerful compounds like Amphetamine or Adrafinil to keep alertness high while behind enemy behinds. Counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of harsh stimulants with a vasodilator like Viagra. Compensate for the dehydrating effects of the aforementioned substances by stocking up on coconut water or Pedialyte. Finally make sure to follow my [Semen Demon Cum Maximization protocol](https://archive.is/sBUWE) 7 days out from your drug fueled 8-hour sex marathon.


**How To Have a Drug Fueled 8 Hour Sex Marathon**

Provided you are young, healthy and exercise regularly you ready to follow the path of sexual visionary Hunter Biden. If not, you will suffer a cardiac event drowning in your own blood atop a mattress that regularly receives more DNA than 23andme. On the other hand, perhaps there is no better way to go than by having your heart burst while giving a Butt-Nut-Slut your King Kong Shlong. So, if you do decide to give in to your suicidal impulse of sheer molecularizing desire, don't let me stand in the way of your dreams.


The most important aspect of having sex for 8 hours is going into it with both eyes open. This is not about love, emotional intimacy or even lust. All of that could be accomplished by the 25-minute Saturday morning sex your dad bestowed upon the hardworking Mexican housekeeper while your mother perfected her breathwork at Yogalates. You're not a silly Seinfeld-watching, Gen X suburban dad compensating for a dead marriage and a long commute. So don't fuck like one. You're a drug-fueled emotionless terminator leaving humanity behind atop a shaking, rambling mess whose name is not important. Acknowledging others unnecessarily imposes limits upon the self, creating a cycle of servitude bereft of exploration or spontaneity.


This can only be justified through the Will to Power. This is the sex act without ornamentation, perversion or fantasy. If anything, it's an athletic event or perhaps an extreme sport.  It cannot be reduced to the pleasure principle as it goes past the point of simple enjoyment. This is death drive. It is an act of pure willpower to negate yourself inside the body of another melting into nothingness. Given enough time, sex melts all recognizable stable individuality leaving behind an absolute negativity devoid of ego or attachment. Transgression is knowledge. He who transgresses not only breaks a rule. He goes where others do not. He knows something they don't.


**Dragging Women into The Shadow Realm with Your Demon Dick**

At some point you will reach a runner’s high. You may start to notice other sensations that were until now only in the background. Nothing is a certainty, but if anything draws entities without bodies its strong emotion, psychosis-inducing drugs and the warm smell sexual excretion. Between 3 and 4 AM is the sweet spot for this about ⅔ of the way through.

This is where the boundary of our reality is semi-permeable. If you have the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of John Dee, Shabbetai Ẓevi or Aleister Crowley. Beware the Machine Elves, for they will tempt you along the way and impair your progress. You must be indifferent to them as to the homeless crossdressing hooker on the corner of Hollywood and Vine. If your concentration is strong and you can properly surf the line between sexual exertion and lucid sleep, you stand a chance to be greeted by a [representative of the shadow realm.](https://i.imgur.com/Us8He5B.jpg)

This is the jackpot. Some people spend thousands of dollars at meditation retreats and waste decades in search of gnosis, surrounded by dirty flee-ridden hippies. Gross. Avoid the lines, wait and hassle. Take the fast-track easy pass by piloting a tattoo-covered, drug-fueled, social media addicted female ship into Hades to enter into dialogue with the shadow people. It’s not really about sexual strategy. It’s about using sex as a strategy. Let’s be honest, the ultimate Red Pill is speaking with the shadow people and following their advice. Now that's self-improvement.

Who the fuck am i?

This post, amongs couple of others got taken down at other subreddit. Some of the readers that got the glimpse of it before it was taken down suggested i post it here because you guys would like it.My plan was to wake some people up to the truth over there. But moderators thought differently.Anyway.

Haven't been on this sub since it was shut down. It's good to be back tho. I wonder what old school legends that are still here, that i looked up to, will think of this. Would love to discuss it with them. Enjoy.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first letter in the series i planned. It will litteraly fuck your brain to success. Wake you up to what the world looks like. Next post will be about your mindset, and how you need to look at the world to succeed.

This is the real world, welcome.

Get a beer, soda, coffee, or whatever the hell you prefer. And let's begin. There is a lot to digest.

# Yourself

* **What is a high value men**
   * Takes care of his body & mind. He knows what he wants out of life and out of relationships. He is social and has a good sense of humor. He knows who he is, or at least who he wants to be, he has goals, and is constantly striving to get there. He is unapolegethic. Has sets of values, principles, view of world. His own set of beliefs. He acts according to them. And he knows that some of them might be wrong according to some people, maybe he is not perfect, but he realizes that is okay. He is always in a good mood because he trusts himself and he knows whatever happens he is going to be fine. That is core confidence. Having his own reality and living up to it. So, be yourself because that place is not taken yet.
* **One thing women crave**
   * Women want attention. Everything they do is to get attention. Use this as a tool to drive them away, or to pull them in. Attention is the currency of female world, another currency is emotions.
* **Emotions**
   * Emotions have no place in mans life when he is talking with women. All they want is attention, emotions will make you give them what they want. Be rational, stoicism will help you with this. Never argue with her, if you can’t reply anything nice, ignore her. Don’t let her take control of your emotional state. I don’t say dont feel emotions, just dont react to them. You need to be like a rock. Use lack of attention as punishment, raising your voice and spilling emotions to her will do nothing most of the time.
   * ""I Love you"", let her tell this first. Don't be that guy that rolls over after sex and whispers this in hear ear. I do love women, but love for us is different. You need to stay a challenge, and if you say it first it means she already got you.*“Listen, smile, agree, and then do whatever the fuck you were gonna do anyway.”* ― *Robert Downey Jr*. Be a wild horse, a stallion, running free, never tamed. But let them think they can tame you.
* **Only sexual ones get the girl**
   * Only men who are sexual will get the girl, else you will end up in a friendzone. Be upfront, give compliments, touch her, strong eye contact, sexual undertone... Show her you have a dick and a set of fanily jewels. Don’t let her think you are dickless.
* **Getting girl is not success**
   * Reaching your goals is success. Women are just a seasoning. Making a bland world much more wonderful and enjoyable.
* **EGO**
   * Ego is the enemy. But only if you let it become one. In order to be successful and dream big you need HEALTHY DOSE OF EGO. Not ego in a sense of proving yourself to others or being a little bitch and letting emotions dictate your actions. Let your ego loose sometimes, when you are dreaming big. When you are trying to succeed you need it. Just keep it tamed. Don’t let it destroy you. But don’t kill it completely. *Ego is not always the enemy.*
* **Money & looks**
   * Looks give you a permission, a foot inside the door. Good looking men are naturally confident because of their looks which gets them more women. By the way, anyone can be a good looking man. Start lifting, start eating right, get a nice haircut, grow a stuble. And you will look better than 80% of men. Women will tolerate more shit from attractive men. Getting that V taper is important. But it is not quite enough.
   * Money makes men interesting. Because girls want only one thing: to have fun. But money alone will get you gold diggers, which you dont want. I dont want them. Money also gives premission to be arrogant, confident, ""because he is successful and therefore high value"". Or on a mission, driven to succeed in everything he does. Skills you learn while making money, especially sales, are applicable to game. And vice versa. You are selling yourself. Influence is also a money making skill that will get you women. Persuasion also. By making money you automatically get qualities of a high value man: Confident, driven, abudnance mindset, fun, doesnt give a fuck…. Get on a mission, start working towards a goal.
* **In pain is the measure of a man**
   * When you are young you MUST do this one thing: indulging in painful activities. Apporaching women is scary? Do it. Fighting is scary? Train boxing and book a fight. Starting a bussines is scary? Start it. Stop wasting your time doing things that make you weak. Wathcing netflix, jerking off, playing video games. You think Muhammed Ali wasted his time to become a world heavyweight champion? Fuck no. He worked his ass off for a goal. And if you notice his demeanour, he had an ego. But used it in a right way. Read that section if you haven't.
* **Produce content, dont indulge it**
   * This comes hand in hand with making money, indulging in painful activities, and being on a mission, or having a goal. Stop watching youtube videos and starting making them. Stop scrolling thorugh instagram and looking at girls, approach them. Or grow an audience by providing value in the world instead of just taking value from it. Number one thing that successful people know is the meaning of the word VALUE. If you provide value to the world, you will get money and success in return. Hell, i learned all of this information in couple of years. And you are getting it in one day. I got it by indulging in content for years, experimenting it myself. Lots of this is stuff i read 3-4 years ago, i don't even know where. But now i am producing content and trying to show you what i learned. So, stop wasting time, start creating.
* **Being with beatiful women gives you a slight edge**
   * Being with extremely beatiful women changes who you are. It gives you this drive and passion. Women are amazing creatures. I completely disagree with the whole mgtow thinking or whatever. Yes, women are different. But STOP hating them, start loving them and accepting them for what they are. They are nature itself. Now, you can go for average girls, sure, 5s and 6s. But once you start being with trully beatiful women, the whole world will change for you. You will know what i am talking about once you start dating them when you read all my upcoming posts ;)
* **“I am enough”**
   * Every battle is won or lost before it is ever fought. Sun Tzu said that. Stop thinking you need to be an “alpha” to get hot girls. Your frame is: “I am enough.” Your frame is NOT “I’m a badass alpha who’s better than everyone”. Eliminate self-destructive beliefs. Stop the though as soon as it pops in your mind. “i am scared”---- “BEEP! Feeling scared makes me excited and pumped with adrenaline. I am so much awesome right now!”.

# Women

* **What do women want in a man**
   * A high value men. Read the whole post and you will get an idea who that guy is.
* **Women = emotional, men = logical.**
   * Women are also attracted with “body”, men with “mind”. That is why kino is so important. Everything that woman does comes from place of emotions. If she doesnt feel like going to the gym, she wont go. But a man knows “well i feel like shit but i have to go to the gym” and goes to the gym. Drama, shittests, crying. Those are all about her emotional state. And if you try to solve it with logic you are wasting your time! Remember that. Never argue with her.
   * Judge by actions not words. Girls are emotional, and what they say and do is not always congruent. They are not logical beings. Realize that. They act on their emotions. Obviously this is overgeneralized but in most cases it is true.
   * A life line consists of flat line, than upward and downward spikes, than again a flat line. This is what women want! They want their emotions to go upwards & downwards, with occasional flat lines. As i said and will say, one thing women want is fun. By being fun and making her feel emotions you are speaking their language. You are sparking her emotions with spikes. You speak the language of gina tingles. Remember that. On the other side is being boring all the time, flat lining, which is the language of virginity.
* **Perfect is boring**
   * One of the greatest lessons i learned. Never try to be perfect. Thats it. Perfect date, perfect time to kiss her, perfect hairstyle. No. Dont be perfect it is boring. Be fun and dont take her so seriously. Perfect is boring, being human is wonderful.*” Are you trying to PERFECT yourself when it comes to women or are you trying to HUMANIZE yourself that you find interacting with women as natural as breathing? “*
* **Women want a complete package men.**
   * Charming, funny, successful, inteligent… Not perfect!! Human but successful. Women dont want a gym rat, or rich, but fat men. Some do for one night stand or to take his money. But real and good women don't.
* **Mystery & intrigue**
   * Mystery and buliding an intrigue is what makes that hamster wheel spin in her head. The longer she thinks about you the more she will like you. So dont answer every question seriously. Play games. ""Lie"" about your job. Say you are an astronaut, and never tell you where you actually work. Let her brain think about it. Be mysterious.
* **Nice guy vs a jerk**
   * Imitation is suicide. Nice guy absorbs the opinions of others to please them, or to avoid conflict. Extreme masculinity is jerk. Not afraid of his own sexuality and testosterone. Having strong opinions. Not the ones he heard on TV or someone else put in his brain. No. But ones that he himself formed. He is a train never going off tracks. Use the nature, nature has given you balls and a dick to approach girls. To be a man. Lead, laugh, have your own way. Fortune favors the bold. And bold we shall be. Increase testosterone. Get on a sports team. Train. Socialize. Approach hot women. Todays asshole is a man who knows what he wants and is upfornt and blunt with it. I want sex, therefore i am sexual. He is a leader, he is unapolegetic. He realizes he is a man living his life. And he will not let anyone tell him how to live it. It is his own life and he only has this one.
* **Women dont know what they want**
   * Lead. You need to tell them what they want. IF you have a strong frame, stronger than girls frame, you will do just fine. Be a man. Act like you have answers. What is a strong frame? Fundamentally, it’s a sense of certainty in everything you do. Try testing this while texting. Write messages so she has a clear answer to write. “How old are you”, “We are meeting for a coffee tommorow”, “Do you have whatsapp”… Give them instructions. Be a leader. Show her the path. Dont let her lead, she does not know what she wants.
* **How a beatiful women sees the world**
   * Wake up, 100 unread messages on instagram. 10k likes on my picture, 1000 comments saying im beatiful…. Oversaturated. She is overwhelmed with what she wants, attention, therefore she is overwhelmed with boredom. Every guy tries to do the same thing. Trying to show off and get her attention. They put her on a pedestal. They think she is something to be won. So they act like James Bond, trying to be smooth. Not realizing she is just a girl. And what do girls want? Thats right. FUN! Make it challenging, make her laugh, you want to be like a wild horse. Instead of drooling because of how beatfiful she is, look at her separated from her beauty. Talk to her fat and ugly friend instead of her. Nobody does that, they all go for her, trying to be James Bond. She is so beatiful that only drunk guys approach her, because only they have the courage. She gets an overdose of attention and validation, which leads her to boredom. There is also a ""halo effect"" in psychology, the more physically appealing person is the more we project perfect life about said person. So, we automatically think she is perfect. Men think she is a goddess, she is always pretty. But remember, she takes a shit in the morning, she shaves her legs and armpits. Deep down she is silly, little girl, she is like a child. Like the rest of us. Looking to have fun with someone who is relaxed and open. Someone who realizes all of this.
* **You can judge a woman by how she treats those who will do nothing for her**
   * Improtant thing to realize. This will reveal true nature of beatiful girls. Watch how she treats ugly men who provide no value to her. Judge by action, not words.

# World view

* **How world works**
   * Women love sex as much as men do. They need it. But society made them think they are whores for it. You can see this when talking to them. First reaction after you say something sexual is girly laugh and then the social switch comes on and she is all like “omg not me i never like to be bent over a table and fucked silly.... wow not me”.
   * As men we are supposed to be players. We are supposed to know how to get women, and we are praised if we do know how. That is why many men don’t open up, don’t want to learn game. Because they lean towards the society side that says you should alredy know all of this.
   * Society tries to tell girls that guys with flowers, expensive dinners, giving compliments every few words, being overtly gentleman, kiss goodbye at the end of a date… are guys who they should be with. But their core wants the asshole. One who takes what he wants. They want the “alpha” because that is what millions of years of evolution told her. Only in the last couple hundred years society tries to deny that part.
   * Sex is wonderful. Eveyone loves it. EVERYONE. It is natural, beatiful and everywhere. You neighbours are fucking right now probably. If 2 people like eachother sex is natural thing that is supposed to happen next. Don’t ever judge people that hookup. Ever.
   * In todays day and age to get girls you need to show her that you are alpha and you want sex. You are sexual man. But you also need to appeal to societal norms. And show her you don’t judge her. Be unapolegethic about your sexuality, and not judgmental of other peoples sexuality. Never brag about sleeping with women, because it is a natural thing. You never brag about showering, or eating. Because it is natural. Then you become the guy who girls just get used to. He is just like that, very sexually open and does what he wants. Disclaimer : Girls will also try to bind you, they will want to be “the one”. They will invest in you. Beta males will also want to shame you. Dont give a flying fuck.
* **Mens purpose is to pass the genes as much as possible**
   * This was our purpose throughout history. To reproduce. Once you show girls you are alpha they will want to keep you. But if they turn you into beta, you were not alpha in the first place! Catch 22 for you there. Trying to make you jealous, shitests, those are tools to test you if you are alpha or beta. They want attention, they will tell you be more available, be with only me, do what i tell you to do… but secretly they want you to never listen to her. And be who you are, being a challenge *always*. I am not saying they want to be treated badly, im just saying they want a man who does not make her #1 priority and does everything she says. Those are tests to see if she can do whatever she wants to you. Lines in a sand. If you dont pass them, she loses respect and leaves you. So, never get butthurt, never go out of your way to please her, dont take her too seriously. Show her that you have a strong frame of mind and you will not tolerate her bullsht.
* **Love**
   * Love is beatiful. I hate when men dont realize this. Love is one of the things that makes time on earth worthwile. But love is not uncoditional. You should fall in love, but be ready to cut women off instantly if they don’t respect your boundaries or respect you. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Relationships should always be the result of abundance not a result of scarcity. And you can love 10 girls at the same time, who am i to differ.
* **80/20 rule, why you dont get hot women**
   * 20% of the men sleep with 80% of the women. This is true. High value man have abudnance of women. This is why you need to get in that upper eshalon of men. Those 20% of guys. If you live in a small town you know this already. There are some men who get tons of women while others never touched a girl. This is the truth. And women go for that 20% of men, why wouldn’t they? Wouldn’t you do the same thing?
* **Men are born with no value, women have value proportionate to their hotness**
   * Men are born with a blank paper, and on that paper you need to draw yourself. Create perfect version of you. Some men never realize this, and their paper is a horendous picture. Women on the other hand are born with attractive body, huge tits, ass, and hourglass shape. This is their value to the world. And they can usually bend it however they want.
* **Wake up**
   * You should begin to see that most males are wimps who bend over for groupthink and refuse to stand straight with their own conviction. Real men are rare. Be one. Decide.

Just an FYI,By reading this you are ahead of other people already. Most men think they are Casanova’s. They are not. We are all learning. By being here you are litteraly amongst the rare 0.01% of the world that have this information laid out. I could sell this for a lot of money to be honest, some people write less than this and call it a ""program"". And this is just one part of the letters!

Well u can, but u can't really be surprised. Maybe when u were blue pill, you thought it was gonna be all wholesome and nice to date and have relationships, only to discover that in reality it's a lot more cutthroat than u expected. It's understandable to feel exhausted by this, but u were born a man. This is the male condition. In humans, the number of offspring that will be produced in the next generation is limited by the number of women in a society. 1 man can get 100 women pregnant, but 100 men and 1 women leaves us with zero offspring and a dead woman. As a result of this, sexual selection is a lot harder on men. There will be winners and losers. 

If u are a loser, that's your fault. Women are just like men, they operate for their own benefit. If you are mad at them for taking advantage of their situation for their own benefit, you are stupid. That's what they're supposed to do. They are women. They are not supposed to be selected as intensly as us men. As a man, you are supposed to rise to the challenge. Nobody cares when you cry, nobody gives you free compliments, and you can't have the luxury of a passive dating strategy (just waiting for a girl to come to you and ask you to fuck her) like women can. 

When you realize this fully, it's a make or break moment for you as a man. You either become an alpha or beta by deciding yourself if you are man enough to rise to the occasion. Regardless of money, looks, career, etc (altho it does help) the main way for a man to get laid is by TALKING. That's right half of the battle is mental. You can be old, ugly, bald, but if you approach 100 women in a day in a flirty, confident way I guarantee more than 1 woman will be under the sheets with you that night. The battle is all mental.

 I see a lot of fit young men select themselves out of the dating pool before any girl does that for them. They do this by assuming rhe girl they like is out of their league, or by (when and if they finally do approach) being much too timid and afraid to talk about sex with a hot girl. 

If you know how women think and how they operate, you'd be able to get laid at a high rate just by playing the numbers game with as many women as possible. If you don't know how they operate, you may get frustrated at women as a whole and begin to hate them. To me this is a sign you already lost, as hate should be reserved for adversaries you respect, not ones that can be easily dominated",1659040006.0

I see too much of this shit on askTRP and it's killin' me. 

First off let's address the elephant in the room. 

You're dating a bitch that thinks this is okay? 

Wow. Crazy. 

I've never dated a bitch that thought it was okay, on principle, to hang out with another man, no matter how long she's known him, one on one without me present OR without at least attempting to run it by me first to gain my approval. 

All my niggas have never been in that situation either so....

But okay you're finding yourself in this little predicament and you're like ""damn I don't wanna come off as Ike Turner but I ain't tryna come off as a lil' bitch like Timmy Turner."" 

Here’s my go to phrase. 

This is all you have to say, with a raised eyebrow, and then you nod your head and keep it movin. 

Then your bitch will lose her mind, see the error of her ways, and back off. 

And all I say is ""Oh, is this what we're doin' now?"" 

Then just nod your head knowingly (as if you've been WAITING for her to give you permission to jump) and say 

""Aight then."" 

\- - -

A few years back I was dating one of my exes. It's been about a lil over a year and a half and we've established some boundaries. 

So she didn't like it when I talked to other females that weren't family members on my phone. Like me textin' them all day and night made her uncomfortable and back then I was a lot ""nicer"" (relatively) so I was like ""Okay whatever"" cause I knew that she wouldn't set a boundary that she herself wouldn't follow. 

Or so I thought. 

She had always been hasslin me about texting female coworkers and shit but her anxiety rubbed me the wrong way. It was never proactive, it was always REACTIVE. As if she didn't want me to do what she had BEEN doing. 

So I snooped through her phone and sure enough she's got like five male friends she's been chatting up on FB messenger. 

Now, I ain't give a shit - but the PRINCIPLE of the matter was that she was being a hypocrite. 

So I just started texting all of my female friends, all of my female coworkers, hell even a past fling right in front of her. 

Of course she got mad af and I was like ""Well, this is what we doin' now."" 

She pretended like she ain't know what I was talkin' about. But I ignored her and kept doin' my thang, then she finally broke down and cried and admitted that she did it because she knew that SHE'D never cheat or meet up with them but that she was TERRIFIED that I would get ""tempted"" and cheat behind her back. 

I was like damn gurl I ain't cheat on you yet. 

Obviously she saw the error of her ways but remember **there's no going backwards.** 

She was tryna have her cake and eat it too, which is what we all want at the end of the day. Unfortunately she couldn't pull one over on me so I just kept textin other bitches and she either had to accept it or leave. 

She accepted it.  

\- - -

Another example. This was back when I dated my baby mama (and she wasn't my baby's mother). 

She posted a FB status with a collage of different movie stars on it and in the comments her sister mentioned how much she was attracted to one of them. My baby mama said that she was ""honestly attracted to all of them but one."" 

So nothing is inherently alarming about that. I ain't an idiot I know that she can be attracted to other niggas, especially celebrities. 

But I knew for a FACT that if I posted some shit like that she would be blowing me up like the Unabomber. 

So I turned to her and said ""Oh, is this what we're doin' now?"" 

She was like ""what do you mean?"" 

I didn't dignify her ignorance. I just nodded my head and said ""Nah it's aight."" 

Then she started panicking and said ""It's about my Facebook status?"" 

So....she guessed right on the first try. 

Damn I wonder why? 

I just said ""I didn't know it was okay for me to post on Facebook that I'm attracted to female celebrities my bad."" 

Obviously I'm fuckin' with her mind heavy by just laying it out there like that, that's why you have to calibrate. 

Unfortunately my baby mama is one of those bitches that does shit without thinking, so she puts herself in these hypocritical situations and you have to spell it out for her. 

You know the types of bitches that thinks that the rules don't apply to her because SHE'S above degeneracy but YOU aren't? 

Well that's all females actually. 

Anyways she knows that I love me some Lucy Liu (circa Kill Bill), she knows that I have a deep collection of porn (including asian flicks - shout out to Asa Akira) and she knows that I had a previous fling with an asian bitch. 

So I was like ""But that's okay since you're setting the precedent let me let Facebook know how fine Lucy Liu is."" 

So at this point she's panicking, getting on her phone and she deleted the post. She's apologizing profusely. 

But like I said before.....

**There is no moving backwards.** 

So I posted the status. And she's being hysterical, crying and shit. I shrug cause I don't give a fuck. Told her that this is our new normal cause you know, I'm petty. 

Eventually she calms down and just accepts it. 

\- - -

Now I am not the jealous type.  I never feel threatened by another man, and I've never been cheated on. It just doesn't register within me to feel that way because like Gucci Mane said, ""Girls are like buses - miss one next fifteen one comin'.""  

That's why it's so easy for me to ""go along"" with shit. 

Yea sure I won't text no bitches.....oh wow my LTR has been texting other dudes the whole time? Cool just means that I can do whatever the fuck I want. 

It's like I always say around these parts 

She will show you what you can or can't do. 

That's because the woman is operating out of a position of weakness. She SHOULD have more to lose, meaning if she's loose with the boundaries, that means she legit doesn't give a fuck, so why should you?

If she is TIGHT with it, then she is either insecure af or she's terrified of losing you. 

Then you have some that actually have a little common sense and know how to set proper boundaries. 

Now this doesn't mean that I don't have any boundaries, it just means that when a bitch walks over the line that tells me that it must be okay for me to do that shit cause she obviously doesn't give a fuck. 

Just know that there's no turning back.",1659043778.0

We work until we're tired and sore. Trudge through what we all know are meaningless jobs. We cook up some microwave crap that has a hundred ingredients, or order cold delivery food, and put that shit in our bodies. Day after day.

We lay on our backs for hours in front of the television, staring, unthinking, unmoving except to crap out the shit dinner we ate earlier and get another beer to desensitize ourselves to our thoughts.

42,Setting boundaries in a relationship: what it’s REALLY like,114,w8kv9f,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w8kv9f/setting_boundaries_in_a_relationship_what_its/,30,"I’m sure if you watch or follow any RP creators out there you’ve heard it spoken of as one of the great double standards of the dating marketplace…how women can have such lofty expectations and it’s her having “standards”, but if a man has boundaries of any kind he’s instantly “controlling” and “insecure”.

But have you ever really stopped to think about this concept? Have you ever thought about what your theoretical boundaries are? I’m not talking about the prototypical “must drop her male friends/not have personal social media/etc”, but more intrinsic boundaries that pertain specifically to your personality, physical, mental and emotional needs and desires?

In formulating my own over time, I’ve come to realize a few things:

-	It is a psychologically jarring experience, because we as men in particular in our former BP world were conditioned to not only not have standards at all, but to supplicate to women’s. It “feels” uncomfortable at first because you’re not used to putting your needs ahead of others.
-	For that same reason, most women are thrown off by it. It’s the programming…and because of that programming, your boundaries are *highly* likely to end potential relationships before they ever start. That’s not your fault. Most women are simply not conditioned to cater to men. It’s you who has to reprogram her. Your boundaries are a part of that.
-	You need to be congruent for these boundaries to even be taken seriously. Like much of what we have as RP aware men, it’s not a right but a privilege earned by raising our value. Any conditions you set need to be conducive to the benefit you give to a woman for her meeting those conditions. The greater the benefit, the more weight your boundaries will hold.

The takeaway here if anything is that you will feel a certain level of discomfort setting and stating your boundaries at first, but this should in no way deter you from it. Stick to your guns, hold to your standards, and if they repel any woman who you had interest in, treat it like a dodged bullet. This is all part in parcel of knowing your worth as a man and respecting your needs and desires, not putting hers (or anyone’s) ahead of your own.",1658844793.0
43,How can I be less self-conscious and stop having anxiety? How can I start having more confidence,83,w77bfx,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w77bfx/how_can_i_be_less_selfconscious_and_stop_having/,61,"Hi everyone, i'm a 21 year old guy living at home with his parents and I've been having self conscious thoughts and feeling anxious and would like to learn how I can have more confidence and stop the self consciousness and  just stop giving a fuck. My mom is overprotective and it's honestly gotten worse these past couple years since the pandemic hit so I don't really get a lot of freedom and independence at home and she won't really let me take the car out alone yet and she wants me to drive with her for a lot more times before I take it out alone, but ive been driving with her in the car for a while now at this point. It's summer time and I feel like I could be getting a lot more done since I've wasted my previous years staying at home a majority of my day doing nothing which is why I'm feeling a bit impatient about it but I guess I'll have to suck it up for the extra month and continue to drive out with her until I finally get the car on my own. But I guess this has developed into me having less confidence and being more self conscious. Everytime I go out, it has to be with a parent since my mom won't let me take the car out alone just yet, so I have gotten self conscious thoughts such as worrying about what others think about me since Im a grown man and still go out with my mom, and don't go out alone. Another example is that since a lot of people on the road don't drive with their parents, I'm basically the only one, I just have a thought that I'll see someone that I know and they see me driving with my mom and judge me for it.

 I guess the good thing is that I save a lot of money at home, and I don't get in college debt; but I can't help but think that I've missed out on a lot of fun and meaningful experiences that could've turned me into a more successful  and improved version of myself that I would've liked . Before, I used to live at a dorm in college as a freshman before the pandemic hit. At this time, I got a girlfriend for a couple months but then afterwards broke it off. I had more experiences with hooking up with a couple girls from tinder living at a dorm, and experiencing the freedom  and independence that I've never had before. Not only that, but my relationship with my family and my mother has improved a lot during this time as well. I felt good, a lot better mentally than I do right now.  I haven't had sex ever since so it's been about 2-3 years. I look at a lot of other people my age and even younger than me have a lot of freedom and able to go out and stay out late doing whatever and driving on their own; Just me constantly having to do stuff and always go out with my mom instead of by myself just made me a lot less motivated to just go outside in general since I always have to go out with her. I talked to her about it and she says things like shes gotta make sure everything is perfect before I take the car out, but I've been driving perfectly fine, and tbh, having her in the car distracts me a lot sometimes.

How can I get rid of these self conscious thoughts though? And how can I just have more confidence throughout any situation such as these situations? Because i just don't want people to see me too much as a spoiled mamas boy who can't take care of himself",1658700349.0
44,"Cold Approach to Close in One Week: All the Signs are There, Old Timers Edition",145,w59r2i,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w59r2i/cold_approach_to_close_in_one_week_all_the_signs/,42,"Because I think FRs should be instructive, the purpose of this quick report is to show what indicators of interest this recent woman threw off before we got down to business.

***tldr: AWALT regardless of age, they all throw off the same signals***

So those of you who have read my other posts, know that I'm mid-'50s, and that my target demographic is '40s and '50s. Also that I like to give advice to the older men who are just coming back into the market after divorce/death, or who are just getting sick of being a grown up incel.

**BACKGROUND**

I was out last Friday watching some live music. Yes, I went there by myself, it's what I do sometimes.

Outside, hot, stormy Summer night, at a local cidery on the side of a mountain. Very nice venue. I wanted to approach a my-age looking redhead with tight jeans and a nice spanky-looking ass, but by the time I got over to her group she had moved on.

I wound up talking with a different woman, who cares, I like talking with people \[search my posts for ""Ditch 'cold approach' in favor of 'learn how to initiate conversations with strangers' without having a goal other than the initiation itself"" for how-to talk with random people\].

**THE INDICATORS OF INTEREST**

Let's get to the list of indicators I saw when talking to her which I took as the ""go ahead"" signals:

* She would make strong eye contact, then smile and look down
* Turning her body towards me
* Asking questions about me instead of talking about herself (that's a real good one).
* Touching me on my arm, shoulder, in response to me similarly touching her first (it's called ""reciprocal action"" I think, and it's a thing, try it. People will mimick your movements subconsciously if they like you)

Doesn't seem like much, but for those of you just starting out they're subtle but once you know what to look for you'll see them. The hard part, often, is trying to keep the conversation going while not only reading these signals, but doing some minor escalation, (confidently touching a total stranger you just met can be daunting), calibrating if/how well it worked, then continuing.

It was time for me to go so I used my usual closing, as I opened my phone to the dial-pad and handed it to her, ""I'd like to hear more about \[whatever topic it was, I think it was bluegrass music\].  Put in your number and next week and go listen to some \[I think it was \] bluegrass.""

Digits obtained.

**WHAT NEXT**

Here's the fun part that many will recognize but if you're just starting out, pay attention:

I got a text from her after I left, but maybe not even 20 minutes later, saying she enjoyed talking and looked forward to seeing me next week. Big IOI.

\_do\_not\_read\_this smiles as he's rolling up the highway home, because he knows it's ""game on"" from this classic IOI - a quick text, with ""looking forward to"" in the body. Also look for words like ""love"" as in ""I loved talking with you"" and ""incredible"" as in ""I had an incredible time ...""

Then the fun starts. About 30 minutes later I get another text, she's already looked up live bluegrass and other live music for next week. Another classic: the double text.

We trade a few texts over the next few days, always I wait until she at least double texts, some times triple texts. Nothing crazy, I suspect in hindsight she just doesn't do this often. More IOIs - the double texts, the triple texts.

Last one then I'll close out. A lot of you may recognize this all-time classic: the day before we're to meet I get a selfie from her - a picture of her new hair style. Multiple IOIs in that one: she got her hair done, she wanted me to know that she got her hair done and was feeling pretty (the assumption is she did that to impress me), and she sent me an unsolicited selfie.

**CONCLUSION**

Last night I met her, did some dancing to the music, going back to her place which was closer than mine after she mentioned ""it's getting hot, I could use some air conditioning"", I won't detail those because others have done so, better, you get the idea.

Point of my post was to illustrate two things. First, to show how simple it is to read indicators of interest *once you know what to look for*. Second, to show that even for my-age women, AWALT. Older women are just older young women.

**P.S.**: the hot redhead was there and I danced a bit with her too. Planted the seed, so to speak, if I ever run into her again.",1658494005.0

46,I’m diagnosed autistic so forgive my dumb question. Is my coworker into me?,83,w3fjil,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w3fjil/im_diagnosed_autistic_so_forgive_my_dumb_question/,85,"
Hey so this girl I work with put her number into my phone, made her name a contact and texted herself through it

I didn’t even ask, I only asked for her tick tok and she did both.

We seemed to vibe really well at work but I’m socially blind sometimes so obvious cues. Is she into me?

She does not work at the store I work at normally 

She told me about her daddy issues and stuff after making a contest to see if her dad was worse or mine. I offhanded a short answer and allowed her to talk about it. I think I validated her slightly too much but I didn’t want to be an asshole about her dad beating her or her uncle trying to sleep with her when she was a kid. Just kind of direct eye contact asking if she feels ok, I only really responded with “you must have really needed to get that off your chest” she was trying to act like it didn’t bother her what they did.

We were at the register and it was baron of customers,

It was the first time I met her and she kept coming back to the register to talk to me, I would even move to like 3-4 different spots at the front and she would come talk to me

The end of the day we hung out more waiting for the next person. So that was for a few hours.

She’s 30 and I’m 25

She’s 4’10 and I’m 5’11

There was a bit of proximity happening, not too intense. 

There were tests I think but not sure ( we were talking about how she died her hair and I asked to touch it. She says no kind of smiling and I drop it, a few minutes later she said I could touch it. I kind of palmed the back Of her head without actually grabbing and I think she responded well but I couldn’t tell. Wasn’t more than a second.

I also kind of teased her for being 30 a bit “would you be mad if I handed you a cane?” She said yes but was smiling and laughing I think.

there was a bit of nose teasing (she doesn’t like her nose) but I dropped the tension with validation for a bit because by that point I had already been teasing her for too long.

Im a cashier who was visiting her store for a day, My Store Manager is going to have me work with him there more often so I’ll see everyone 
(By the way everyone seems to really like me there according to my store manager)


she just happened to be a shift supervisor. I don’t know if that speaks for something.

Does this mean something or am I looking into it too much?

Also if it’s a good sign when should I text her to lead a date? This all happened today up to 1 hour ago. I have not texted her and didn’t plan to for a day and a half 

Im sorry my post is all over the place. Let me know what you think. And remember I’m actually diagnosed autistic so don’t get disgusted with my lack of understanding, (you wouldn’t get mad at a deaf person for not hearing you well)

If you bothered reading this far thank you I would love to know what you think",1658299731.0

Ahhh yes. The title of the post is basically the message I've been receiving for the last couple of days. It's pretty annoying if I say so myself.

Now this girl was absolutely gorgeous, easily HB9/10 (since I don't believe in 10/10). Amazing face, body, a body count of 5 with myself included (a little too high for a LTR in my opinion), etc. My friends thought I stumbled on a unicorn. Throughout the entire time I was with this girl, 2.5 years, I have always told my friends that ""I'm just enjoying my turn"" and exposing everyone to some basic RP principles. Since March, both of us started losing interest. We never really did anything together. I loved to go to the gym 6x a week, work on my cars, work on my business, make healthy meals at home, work on my Youtube channel, etc. She liked to do exactly none of those. Not only that: she only wanted to watch movies, go travel anywhere, go out to eat (a pretty shit tier diet as well), etc. Just a bunch of shit I didn't want to do. Not only this, but she would push me to do this crap and I lashed out several times due to how pushy she was. My only interest lately is growing, and will always be to do so. For the last year I couldn't have given less of a shit about vacations. So when the opportunity came, I held the door right open for her to pack her shit and leave. To be honest, I didn't give a shit. One door closes, many more open.

**Where the problem begins** is when all my guy friends offering to come over and try to comfort me. I like to keep my inner circle full of those who think similarly and are financially successful. Wait a minute, aren't you guys supposed to be RP'd as well? My response is typically something along the lines of ""My mom died last year, I'm fine. This is nothing, seriously. The only woman who will truly love you is your mother. This is to be expected. AWALT. I saw this coming since the beginning and I'm surprised it lasted this long as well."" One, some, or all of those quotes; you get the picture. So almost immediately I started messaging other interests, but I had no response from a single one (since I'm being honest here). Surprising, but that's OKAY. There are many more women out there. In my opinion, if you really are RP aware, this shouldn't be anything to mourn or be upset about. Instead celebrated.

Can't make this up fellas, and I'm over having to tell them individually. I'd rather everyone know this perspective. Today I'm thoroughly enjoying my newfound lifestyle change even without plates, they will come.",1658430642.0

I am going to apologize ahead for the long post but I need some outside advice to change my situation asap

Coming out of covid it seems there are lot of lingering problems that I need to work on. One example is that I’ve been going to the gym for years to the point I am a “big guy” bodybuilding wise but going back after they reopened the gym was an uphill battle now being diagnosed with asthma. I have come to terms with my new condition after getting covid working around it in the gym by doing at least 2 miles of cardio every day and working on my posture since it got messed up at my office desk job.

*My main issue* I need help with is that I noticed my focus/concentration is essentially gone – nonexistent. If I try to read or write something, a simple paragraph will take me hours to complete like this post as an example took me nearly 6 hours to manage to get it done. I know the obvious is that I got foggy brain due to COVID along with a bunch of other things but I also didn’t help my situation by spending a ton of time playing video games, talking to friends online, watching porn, endlessly scrolling through social media, staying up really late and working from home is not necessary a good thing with these problems.

I managed to cut out all my bad habits so that most of my day is spent working from home, training at the gym and trying to self study which to no luck my focus still hasn’t returned. This is another huge factor since self studying (computer science) will better myself for the long run and it’s been an uphill battle just to open the page. I don’t want to say I am burnt out because once I got a job I took it easy for 9 months. I have just been extremely unmotivated that everything seems to make me feel tired, not in a sad/depressed way more in a no energy feel in things I once loved such as hobbies, going out, video games etc. all feel like a chore to do.

49,How to be Challenging,167,w1z2kp,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w1z2kp/how_to_be_challenging/,14,"I hate when dating coaches claim they can improve somebody’s game with “one simple line” or “one easy trick.” But there is actually one line that dramatically improved my game: when I am having a conversation with a woman and we disagree on something, I say “oh, well I guess it’s not going to work out” in a jokey, light-hearted way. For example, I might say, “oh you don’t like cheesecake, it’s probably not going to work.” Sometimes I even get up and say something like “you really do not like dogs? Well it was nice chatting with you,” and pretend like I am leaving. 

This joke may seem stupid and meaningless, but it actually accomplishes a very important function in the woman’s subconscious brain. Even if she knows you are joking, she will subconsciously feel like you are a challenge, there is a distance of power between you and her, she must work to get you, and you are “above” her in the subconscious tribal dominance hierarchy. It may sound crazy, but just by saying these few words, the power dynamic in the relationship shifts completely. Previously, my interactions and dates would sometimes fail because I seemed too interested and available, but adding this one little line completely fixed that problem. 

Being challenging also sets the frame that she is chasing you and you are not chasing her. You can even make a woman feel like she is chasing you even if she was not chasing you before simply by making a joke like this. Sometimes when I make the “it’s not gonna work out joke,” the woman rolls her eyes or looks at me like I am crazy because she was not even thinking of us in relationship terms. But it does not matter – now she IS thinking that way and about how she needs to stack up. 

Evolution determined that women must chase men, not vice-versa. The alpha male’s most important job is to focus and prosecute the tribe’s mission, so he cannot be distracted by chasing women. He can only pay attention to women who are chasing him. Women must feel like your thoughts and emotions are focused on your mission(s) (whatever they are) and you will only pay them attention and do things for them if and when they deserve it. Even if you are married, a woman should never feel like you have made an unconditional commitment to her – every day is a new opportunity for her to fuck it up. In other words, a woman should never feel like she “has” you – she always needs to feel like she needs to do something else to “get” you. You are like a valuable prize that is just within reach, but she must put a little more effort because she has not quite gotten there yet. 

The biggest mistake men make with women is not appearing challenging. When a man sees a woman he wants, he usually goes full retard and makes clear he will do anything to get her, even if she is not doing anything to reciprocate his interest or favors. It makes sense – being challenging is counterintuitive. When you like somebody, or worse, when you feel like you have met your soulmate, the last thing you want to do is imply that it might not work out. In the Disney movies the handsome prince never says to Cinderella “I don’t think it will work because you live too far.” But yet, that is what you must do. 

Women are attracted to challenging men for four reasons. First, as I have explained, higher-ranked individuals in the tribe are naturally challenging because they focus their thoughts and emotions on the tribe’s mission and not on people beneath them. Therefore, when you act challenging and establish the distance of power women subconsciously feel like you are the alpha male. Second, human beings are excited by challenges, which is why defeating a challenge is an important part of a transcendent emotional experience. Third, being challenging takes pressure off the woman. Men evolved to be predatory hunters, and that what is women see men as, so when a woman feels like a man’s thoughts and emotions are focused on “getting” her and there is no way she can slow the train down, she subconsciously freaks out. And fourth, by acting challenging, you set yourself apart from all the other men she interacts with that are not challenging. 

Humans are wired to focus on and conquer challenges. If the tribe needs ten things to survive and gets nine of those things easily, and 1 of those things is a challenge, the members of the tribe have an evolutionary imperative to focus all their thoughts and emotions on the challenging thing. If our evolutionary ancestors did not focus on challenges, they would die. Even though this emotion makes less sense in a dating context, this is still why a woman who is dating 10 attractive men will focus the one man who is a challenge and ignore the rest, even if he is not as attractive as the others. 

The essence of being challenging is that she must feel like your attitude towards her is always “maybe.” If she feels like you are “yes,” you become boring because she already “has” you and the part of her subconscious mind that seeks a challenge is no longer stimulated. You cannot want something you already have. At the same time, however, if she feels like you are “no,” she will feel rejected and go find a man who she feels like will accept her. You must stay in that sweet spot of “maybe.” As the dating coach Todd V says, you she must feel like you are “interested, but not yet sold.” 

“Maybe” is an extremely powerful psychological motivator. Humans hate uncertainty, and if there is some uncertainty on the way to something we want, we evolved to focus on that uncertainty and “figure it out” to make it certain. Scientists who study addiction have found that addicts are more motivated to chase the objects of their addiction when the reward is unpredictable. In fact, the dopamine rush an addict feels is highest when they are denied the reward. Studies of gambling addicts show that they are most motivated to gamble when the possibility of winning is exactly 50%. To put it simply, the human mind cannot handle “maybe”: we need a fucking answer. 

The spirit of “maybe” must permeate everything you do and say regarding your relationship with her. If she says something like “do you like me?,” “what are we?” or “where is this going?” your answer should always be something like “So far so good, but we will see what happens.” If she asks you to do something for her and she does not quite deserve it yet, your answer must be equivocal. For example, if I meet a woman at a bar and she says “we should hang out sometime” you should say something like “I might be able to do next week, I will let you know” even if every fiber in your being is screaming “yes I would love to hang out with you!!”

Sometimes women shit test you by being overtly sexual to see if they can control you with her sexuality. Even if a woman says something like “I want to suck your dick later” your response should be “we’ll see.” Until you are actually hooking up with her, your response to any sexual innuendo should be “maybe.” All that said, you must be very careful to not sound like you are outright rejecting a woman’s sexual advances. If she gets mad I said “maybe” I will sometimes say “maybe is the sexy thing to say” and change the subject. 

Of course, you must say “maybe” with emotional intelligence in a way that fits the context. How you say “maybe” with your long term girlfriend will be fundamentally different than the girl whose number you just got in the club. Your long term girlfriend has most likely done a lot more work to win your attention and favors than the new girl, so she deserves more of a firm “yes” about certain things. But again, you should never give an unconditional commitment. 

Even if you are a naturally challenging guy with lots of options you must show women you are challenging by doing something challenging. Women evolved to assume most men are beta so if you do not show you are challenging they will assume you are not. The easiest way to do this is to put what I call a “soft obstacle” in front of her. A soft obstacle is when you do or say something that very, very lightly implies you may not accept her. The obstacle, however, must be something she feels like she can easily overcome. If she feels like the obstacle is too difficult (for example, if you tell her that she is too fat by 50 pounds) she will feel rejected and run off to find somebody else. Examples:

You: “You’re a Pisces? I’m an Aries. You know Aries and Pisces are not compatible, right?” 

You: “You’re only 23? I’m 34! You are way too young for me!”

No woman is going to run home and cry into their pillow because you said your signs don’t match or she is too young for you. Instead, it will motivate her to overcome the small obstacle to get you. And if a small obstacle doesn’t excite and motivate her to get you, she was not into you anyway.

Women sometimes shit test men by acting challenging to see if they can shift the frame from “her chasing you” to “you chasing her.” You must respond to this shit test by sending the message of “I like you, but I will not chase you.” For example, if a woman says “I don’t know if I should date you, you live too far away” most guys would react by saying shit like “No! 20 minutes is not that far! I will drive to come see you! I will pay for your Ubers! Pretty pretty please!” Instead, your response should be to agree and amplify “yeah, I do live too far away. In fact, my real house is on Mars, and it’s quite a commute.” By agreeing and amplifying, you turn the shit test around on her and make it again seem like you are the challenging one. 

If a woman has worked for your affection and her challenging statement is serious, you can acknowledge her contributions to the relationship. For example, if you have been dating a woman for a few weeks and she says “you live too far” your response should be “well, I like you, but that’s your decision.” Remember – you can reward a woman for her contributions, but you cannot chase her. 

Most guys know on some level that women like challenging guys, but they do not quite understand how to be challenging, so they end up acting douchey, weird, try-hard, and unnecessarily aloof. Nothing screams “I am a beta male” than randomly being an asshole to a woman if she has done nothing to deserve it. But even worse, unnecessarily being an asshole makes women feel rejected. A woman should feel like you are ignoring her or withdrawing your attention because you genuinely have better things to do, not because you are trying to hurt her or play games. 

You must also ensure the challenge has the right level of difficulty, like a good video game. If the challenge is too easy, she will get bored and look for a harder challenge. If the challenge is too difficult, she will give up and find a guy who is easier to get. You must constantly modulate the challenge to ensure she is engaged, having fun, but still has not “grasped” you. Being challenging is a feeling, and you must use your emotional intelligent to know when to turn the difficulty up or down. 

When I tell men and women to be challenging, they often sneer and say something like “I am too old to play games.” People that say this misunderstand that the human desire for a challenge is very deep and strong. They also fail to understand that there is a healthy and toxic way to be challenging in a relationship. In a healthy relationship, each party challenges the other party to become better and the parties make a preliminary commitment to each other with the condition that each side must do their part. Every man and woman must be challenging in relationships and any person who makes an unconditional commitment to another person is either lying, stupid, crazy, or all three. A person should be challenging not to “play games” but to make something clear that was true anyway – “you cannot be with me unless you meet certain standards.”

Unfortunately, most people do not understand the difference between a healthy and a toxic challenge, so they chase people who do not give a fuck about them and treat them like shit. Womens’ desire for a particularly challenge often causes them to chase substandard men just because they happened to act challenging at the right time. As we have learned, even if you are a desperate, pathetic, loser, it is easy to appear challenging by saying a few clever lines. The fact that women can so easily fall for this is actually pretty sad. 

So what happens if you blow it by looking needy and beta? Is it possible to recover and look challenging again? The answer is yes, but it takes a lot of work and is usually not worth it. When a woman subconsciously classifies you as a needy beta who is chasing her, it is hard to get her to reverse that classification. Once you get the stench of desperation on you, it is hard to wash off. Even worse, the main problem with trying to get a woman back after you became the beta in the relationship is that YOU feel like a beta vis-à-vis her and will naturally want to act beta around her. A man with true abundance will not even waste his time trying to accomplish this reset – he would just go find a different woman.

Nevertheless, for completeness I will tell you how to “recover” once you have failed to act challenging. Basically, you need to “teach” the woman that you are more focused on your purposes than her. You must send the following message: “I know it appeared for a second like I was more focused on you than my purposes, but that is actually not the case. My purposes are more important and you just misinterpreted my actions.” 

For example, if you approach a woman at a bar or nightclub and blow it by being needy and not being challenging, you can just leave, walk around, and do other stuff, like talking to other people (preferably, other women). You may even walk by her a few times and ignore her to teach her subconscious mind that you have “moved on.” Then, later in the night you can maybe come back and say “oh hey you again. How was the rest of your night”? That sometimes works. 

If you blew it over text by texting too much, it is harder to recover because it is almost impossible to show a woman you have “moved on” over text. The very act of texting her is proof that you are still thinking about her. Nevertheless, if you act too needy over text you can ignore her for a few weeks and then randomly text her something that has to do with your mission and is also interesting to her. 

If you are hooking up with woman and she says “no” to physical escalation (for example, if you try to put your hands down her pants), it is probably because you are coming on too strong. You can often recover by making a joke and then completely changing the subject to something fun or related to your purpose. I might even make a joke saying something like “I didn’t even want to kiss you” and then completely “move on.” If she feels like you have genuinely moved on (and she feels attracted to you), she will want to re-initiate.

50,Angry again,74,w1ta4c,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w1ta4c/angry_again/,80,"This is just a need to vent on my end.

I'm fucking done with women. Every single serious trauma that I had in life has come from women, including my mother, my sister, and women I loved. I worked through it all, I've grown so so much. I'm a very patient dude, I've tried, I've worked empathy, my anger had subsided, I never blow up, I always wait and resolve things peacefully, I always try to see all the possible points of view in any given situation that I can, I've gone through the ""way of love"" as they say, trying to work situations and problems out with the best in mind, hoping the best, treating people well even in times when they don't deserve it, giving second chances, trying to make the best come out of those around me, I've struggled alone through nights, puking my head onto paper to try to understand myself better, to be a better man. I've studied the red pill for years and I took a lot of good from it, I started studying stoicism and parts of Buddhism and it has opened my mind to much more and to ways to live better. My anger had subsided, I was cool again, a fool kind of a dreamer once more, but I felt good, life was nice and hey, guess what?

The last woman I got involved with ended up being fucked up in the head, for real, and she's a lying, cheating pile of shit who believes she's something else in this world while she should have been fucking grateful I even decided to talk to her in the first place, because after knowing her for a year, she's just fucking worthless, and she knows it deep down, that's why she's so damn miserable. Lies and lies and lies, omitting, minimizing, manipulating shit all the time, and then playing victim and taking zero responsibility for anything and putting it all on others. Just a good fuck, that's all she gets, the rest of her is useless.

All my friends and relatives women make their lives difficult too, all of them.

Then in other women I find constant double standards, they're like little girls, sluts that want to be treated like virgins and trash that wants to be treated like queens, justifying cheating for women but not for men, saying that forcing a child on a man ain't that bad but a man that leaves is a fucking asshole and so on, and most of these girls/women today have this retarded sense of entitlement they get out of nowhere, while they whine through phones built with hard to get metals mined by African boy kids and assembled by suicidal Asian men that aren't even allowed to kill themselves at work, while the 4g and 5g technologies invented mostly by men work because men tend to the fucking cell towers and lines and mine the fucking iron and work the fucking machines to create the steel to make the cables and machinery and computers (that require far more prime materials gotten by men) that will be moved by trucks and ships by far driven mostly by men, to be assembled by men to be maintained to be kept on running at all times by men who work their asses off for these good for nothing air-wasting fried-brain useless pieces of shit bitches to take a selfie with filters and post it to get some male attention to try to fill the void they have in their fucking soulless chests, and this is just one example!

Fuck!

What's the point? Yes, some of the most memorable, most happy moments in my life have been with women. Moments when everything else seems to cease to exist. It's you and her and those four walls and time and space vanish and her skin and her heartbeat and her eyes are everything and you want nothing more than that, you could die right then and there.

Yes, that's a thing, but at what cost? Why play this fucking unwinnable game that seems to forever make us miserable? Because if you dedicate to yourself and don't deal with women at all, the loneliness will kill you. If you just fuck plates and nothing else, eventually that will feel so empty, the emptiness will eat you up. And if you try to play the game of a LTR, the drama and the bullshit will sicken you.

There's no winning, is there? What's the fucking point? Why deal with them at all? Do I need to become this kind of Pimp-like semi psychopathic asshole with no empathy to be able to deal with them without getting hurt in the process? Because they seem to me just like porcupines now, and it seems to me only personalities like that get away with it.

Fuck this shit. Seriously. I know the anger will subside in some time and I'll be back to normal, or maybe not, who knows. But I'm done with this stupid game, I'm fucking done.",1658129328.0
51,"The paradox of female ""communication""",142,w1o9gk,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w1o9gk/the_paradox_of_female_communication/,27,"I assert that the greatest irony of all is the fact that women claim to be the paragon of ""good communication"". That's also on top of them always implying that they hold the highest virtue in relationships. It only takes a few short minutes on twoxchromosomes to see this play out. I think that both men and women are quite capable of thinking and behaving irrationally and emotionally, it's just that women are more insidious and manipulative about it.

1- the best example is the choice of words that women use when they argue. Eg: ""You NEVER help out with ANYTHING at home!"" It's obviously not true in the factual sense, but it's true in the emotional sense. She feels unappreciated, upset, anxious, or any other combination of emotions, and her choice of words are optimized to express her emotions in the moment as accurately as possible. Emotional accuracy trumps informational accuracy every single time. It doesn't matter that the words she chooses will cause unnecessary damage to the relationship, and is completely unfair to her partner. She needs to express her emotions, goddamit!

2- the second point is related to the above point: women are generally incapable of sorting out their emotions internally and independently. This is why you have BP guys being used as emotional tampons. They need to continuously flap their jaws until they get tired, and their exhaustion will somehow mean that the emotions are adequately ""processed"" . That is, until they feel anxious again, and the whole process repeats. This is also combined point no 1 above where they will be with a group of guy friends and will blurt out things like: ""Men are trash."" Again, this is coming from beings who are enlightened in the ways of communication and relationship virtue.

3- as if the two points above aren't annoying enough, there is another ironic factor in women's ""relationship skills"": they only do these things to the men in their lives that they trust. The reason for this is simply because despite being highly irrational, women are not stupid. They are in fact very well suited for survival. They know on an instinctual level that if they exhibit these behaviours to any random guy on the street, they will get maced in the face and might end up in the hospital or worse. Even with all the ""girl power"" screeching, they are smart enough to know that getting violent with a man is not a good idea. But she needs to express her emotions, goddamit! Therefore the best candidates are the men in her life that she trusts. Maybe they think we should see that as a compliment?

4- and that's not all folks! Yup it gets better. When you combine points no1 and no2, what you get is a creature with no sense of proportion. A creature who can't process their own emotions without the aid of external expression, and they won't accept any discounts in the expression of their emotions. This means that there is no way to get a word in once they are in this state of positive feedback loop. The only thing to do is to leave the scene and wait for the hamster wheel's energy to dissipate. This is the reason why older men always have to give in to their wives in arguments. ""Happy wife, happy life"" or so they say. Bollocks.

I'm sure you can deduce from the above that the closer you get to a woman, the more of this shit you'll have to deal with. From friend, FWB, boyfriend, fiance, husband, the shit just gets more and more intense. This is really what ""being her rock"" means. It's also why every time I hear a woman screech ""I don't need no man!"", it's so transparent to me it's hilarious. The only real solutions?

1- be happy on your own without needing companionship. admittedly this is very hard and few are able to attain it. In my experience, meditation helps. Notice also that it's always men who attain high levels of consciousness and end up renouncing the world. It's never ""the old woman on the mountain"" is it?

2- the Red Pill. Have relationships with women, but never properly commit. If they know you can leave anytime, they'll be forced to edit themselves in your presence and act out their anxieties with someone else, probably the BP in their orbit. Most people see this as too much work and I empathize. I think it is as well.

What you don't want to do is to try to achieve a middle ground 'purple pill'. It doesn't exist. If men and women are indeed similar, there would be no point in sexual reproduction. We should just be asexual and clone ourselves. The whole point of sex is differentiation. And with differentiation comes conflict, paradox, and irony. It is what it is.",1658111612.0
52,[FIELD REPORT] I pulled a girl while we were waiting for the elevator to the parking garage,80,w175qb,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/w175qb/field_report_i_pulled_a_girl_while_we_were/,41,"**Stats:**

Age: 28

Race: Eastern Asian

Height: 5'7

Location: Las Vegas

**Preface:** I haven't been able to run game as much recently due to my FWBs. I met another local girl 3 weeks ago and now she's my 3rd FWB, which takes up alot of my free time. Initially, I didn't want to write this part because it just feels like a huge humble brag, but I think it's important because it's been 11 months since I started night game and it's drastically changed my dating life. Before this, I had no women in my life. Like it was the Sahara desert up in this bitch. But now, I got 3 FWBs and I'm still constantly hooking up with new girls. I've never had abundance like this before and I gotta say I'm pretty happy with where my life is at this moment.

For those curious, my FWBs are chinese, white, and half black/white. I just need a hispanic girl now lol.

**Set:**

I got off work and went straight to the club. It was LIT. I bumped into 3 wings there so that's always fun. Anyways so I opened probably 10-15 sets total while at the club. I made out with this fine ass black canadian girl but couldnt pull.

Anyways, so I see this girl in a purple dress (Let's call her ashley) who was dancing carelessly with her friends. I approach and open with cold reads. Ashley was hooked after like 2 cold reads. She started asking me questions and I just play guessing games with her. We chat for like maybe 5 minutes tops and then her friend pulls her away, but not to get away from me, more like to talk to her. The friend had something urgent to tell her I guess. I was like ok whatever, I'm leaving so I just bounce. I go on to run a few more sets but nothing sticks. It's 3am so I'm like ok time to go home, I'm seeing one of my girls the next day anyways.

I walk out of the club and through the casino to the garage elevators. Once I get to the elevator lobby, I see Ashley there with all her friends so I reapproach to get her number since I didnt get a chance earlier. I opened with something like ""wow, we finally meet again, it must be destiny"". Her eyes widen and she smiles. Obviously glad to see me again. I make an observation cold read regarding the situation since one of her friends was throwing up. I make minor jokes about it. Then I go into logistics. Basically I'm trying to assess the situation. She says that they're gonna go home but I object and say nah lets go to the after party. I tell her we can get drinks there. She says she's done drinking but she'll smoke weed. Now, I don't have weed but there are 24 hour dispensaries in vegas so not a problem. I said, yeah let's pick up some weed even though I dont smoke. She says bye to her friends and then we head to my car. Picked up some weed, went back to my place, and yall know how it goes ;)

**Key takeaways:**

1. Don't be afraid to reapproach: Just because the initial approach didn't ""work"" doesn't mean the reapproach wont. This isn't my first reapproach success and it wont be my last. 
2. You gotta have some logic when running game: I reapproached Ashley in the elevator lobby so I knew this was gonna be a time sensitive set. She's in a destination where she most likely has to leave very soon. I basically knew I need to speed run this set. I quickly built a little bit of rapport before going straight into logistics. After assessing logistics, I asked for the pull and then solved further logistics such as not having weed.
3. ASK FOR THE PULL: so many guys in this situation would just ask for a number close and call it a night. Fuckkkkk that. Initially, I wanted to invite her and all her friends to the ""after party"" aka hang at my place. There's no fucking after party but I'll cross that bridge IF it happens lmao. Luckily, she was willing to self isolate and come with me. But regardless, if you cant pull the girl by herself, then pull the whole set. There's a 0% chance of me hooking up with her at the elevator lobby but there might be a 2% chance even if I bring 4 girls to my place.",1658063628.0

I'm an ethnic so I don't know maybe the redacted supremacists are correct and people should be with their own kind. Not that I was opposed to my own ethnic group...they just weren't into me. 

I'm at a point now where I've made a ton of bucks during the pandemic: business took the fuck out off, saved up. Ton of educational debt though. 

I have literally no threshold of attractiveness or anything. They just must be someone who wants to have a child, which in this sick sterile society is apparently like finding a needle in a haystack.

Whatever, so I have spent the pandemic grinding workwise, and in the process put on a bunch of weight

Yeah wouldn't it be great if I could both stay in shape and make a bunch of money thanksimcured. I bow down to the ubermenschen who can do both, but I'm not one of them. 

So it's one or the other. Money, or looks. 

Which one should I/anyone do?

I've gotten plenty of girls before, but only when in shape ..and almost uniformly ones who didn't want children for whatever reason.

54,Brown Guys Need To Emphasize the Physical Connection As The Foundation Of Their Relationships,62,vzz0nl,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vzz0nl/brown_guys_need_to_emphasize_the_physical/,81,"I mainly wrote this post for the South Asian guys in this sub however anyone else can learn from it as well especially if they also come from a more conservative culture

Does anyone else notice that Desis (the men in particular) only emphasize connecting with their romantic partners in the form of traditional values and things like religious/educational affiliations? Or even secondarily they might even focus on mental/emotional connection?

There seems to be a complete disregard for the Physical Connection aspect of things.

**This is basically shooting yourself in the foot**

It makes the dating process difficult and basically narrows down your potential pool of partners because now you're only dating girls that come from a certain ""religion"" or ""educational background"". It also subtly sends a signal to all Non-Desis that you only like a ""certain"" type of girl. This makes it so that even if a Non-Desi girl is attracted to you, she will still have preconceived notions about what your ""type"" is and if she doesn't fit that mold then she will just avoid you and won't even really tell you that she's into you.

Furthermore it also creates this whole thing where South Asian men are expected to be career driven, extra responsible/family oriented e.t.c. This might be cool if you're older and looking for a wife, but when you're young and just wanna date around? Stuff like this makes you lose points because women usually only wanna do all that freaky shit with guys they see as ""temporary"".

**This creates a lot of misconceptions**

For example this is why a lot of Desis are so immersed in the idea that their career/money is important. It's because in our community if you're not doing great in your career then you're a complete loser. This makes guys have the misconception that Desi men have to ""betabuxx"". You don't have to betabuxx for shit. The main reason women use guys (of any race) for money is because these guys usually somehow brag to them about how much money they have or that they have some good career and now the woman knows that she can get money out of him by stroking his ego. That's how those dudes end up going on expensive dates and having stupid ""intellectual discussions"" and then end up going home and jerking off. Instead if this dude just talked about stuff other than his career, and instead of talking about money if he just wore a nice pair of shoes that compliments the rest of his outfit then he would be golden.

**Why is it FAR better to pursue a Physical Connection than an Emotional/Mental/Any Other Connection**

Simple. Because it's easy as fuck. To make a **Physical connection**, you just need to find the other person attractive and vice versa and satisfy each others physical needs (Which women have far more than you think). Furthermore just focusing on this aspect makes you seem more exciting and thrilling which makes the woman want you even more.

**Intellectual connection**? Bruh you both need to be well versed in World Issues and shit, and God forbid you have a different opinion from her on any topic because of your life experiences. If this happens too much she will automatically think you're ignorant.

**Religious connection**? Self explanatory unless you're a pastor who's tryna get with some deluded overly religious woman who thinks you're God in human form or something.

**Emotional/Romantic connection?** Now you need to fit into the laundry list of personalized standards in her head that's based on some movie or social media trend/posts that she May or May Not tell you, and if you make a mistake now you're ""not being a good partner"",""I don't like how you're making me feel"".

Also the more ""religious/conservative"" your culture is, if you approach women from a similar culture they will automatically try to make you wait for sex and try to shame you when you try to escalate. When these same women come across a guy from a sex positive culture they won't say anything negative and they'll suck the soul out of his dick because they know that his culture prioritizes the sexual connection so they won't really expect him to fulfil her intellectual/spiritual needs. Instead for those needs she will go to the ""conservative"" guy and then he's gonna be sexually frustrated by her and they're just gonna go on endless sexless dates and he's gonna go whine on the internet.

**This actually negatively impacts men's mental health more**

I've scoured through reddit and seen quite a few posts by South Asian guys talking about how they're upset at their lack of dating success, and then somewhere in the post they'll mention how they only want a University educated woman or some ""conservative girl"" or some girl who ""doesn't participate in hookup culture"". Like bro are you living in 2022 or what?? I can already tell that when these guys go on dates they probably try to talk about some stupid book or intellectual topic, and the girl will be interested for a bit but then get bored as fuck later on. And since these dudes don't really sexually escalate they fail to give a woman the ""tingles"" too. They're the type to go on like 3 dates without even kissing a girl.

The end result for these guys is that the best case scenario for them is going on like 4-5 dates or more with different girls and then talking about bs and then things fizzle out because there was ""no connection"". Then they get depressed and blame it on their race. I personally know I can create a connection with a good amount of girls even though I'm not similar to them in any way just by focusing on the physical aspect.

If anyone has seen the movie ""**Idiocracy**"" it is similar to that scene where all the ""intellectual"" type of people basically breed themselves out by not really having sex, and all the ""lower intelligence"" people conquer the world. No offence to anyone though.

**Food for thought:**

How many times have you stopped talking to/pursuing a girl because you realized that the relationship was going nowhere or because of some dumb cultural reason?

Think about your current/past relationships and what were the foundations of those relationships? Were you mostly emphasizing money? Romantic gestures? Adherence to a Religion? Following some political ideology together? Knowing this can help you realize where things went wrong and which aspects of the connection are better to focus on in future relationships.",1657918749.0
55,Biological Factors Affecting the Dating Marketplace,139,vxg7bi,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vxg7bi/biological_factors_affecting_the_dating/,35,"A lot of newbies face similar mistakes with women, and while experience is the best teacher, sometimes having a macro, big picture understanding of the sexual marketplace can help. After you’ve spun plates, lifted weights, you may still encounter problems with women.

The catchall solution is always ‘dread and lift. The issue is that men are naturally linear - one issue, one solution at one time. So when the previous chick issue is solved (ex: LTR learns to behave, found a new plate, IOIs at the coffee shop, etc) we return to neutral or go overboard. And eventually either the issue repeats or a new issue arises.

To give context we need to understand that women are more manipulative than men. This is from generations of natural selection - men are stronger, and for them to survive in primate societies that solved issues with violence, they need to use their heads. Either through securing strong offsprings from the alpha, or using sex as a transaction to exchange protection from a beta. Maintaining a ‘clean’ image is essential so they won’t be outcasted. Seeing as there are always more betas in a society, and a group of angry betas can be dangerous, so women learn to manage betas. These skills are passed down. Therefore the modern women, like the primate women, have MULTIPLE things on their mind when dating. 

1. Sex: Is he hot? She wants the best offspring, and will screen for good genetic material
2. Emotional draw: Does she get ‘tingles’ from him? Famous? Dangerous? The high and lows.
3. Security: Can he provide? Will it be spent on her? Can he get more when it’s out?
4. Reliability: Does he make her feel better when she cries? Is the frame solid? Good daddy? Is she at ease?
5. Trust: Will he leave when she hits the wall? Will she be left alone? Abandonment possible?

As a guy, it isn’t easy deciphering a women’s intention when she gives him shit. Is it a shit test? Is it a comfort test? It’s even harder when you’re in constant contact due to living with a chick, hence why LTR is TRP on hard mode. Once a women catches onto your pattern of behavior, she’ll start going down the list of what you’re lacking and poke at them.

We need to understand that women at different stages of the lives prioritise different things. The 21 year old will want sex, and emotional thrill. The transactional cost is she will do whatever the guy wants and risk heartbreak or hitting the wall alone. The post-wall women will be willing to sacrifice fun for someone that won’t leave her and can provide. The transactional cost will be she gives the unattractive beta sex. Everything is fluid as women are emotional so her needs today will not be the same as her needs tomorrow.

The solution some might think is to apply different approaches in different situations. Understand context and reply appropriately. ‘But what about AWALT?’ 

AWALT is what prevents us from becoming disproportionate female pleasers. It’s a trap to seek the perfect answers because that means we are in their frame. Do we give security because she wants it? Do we give sex because she wants it? If she wants a more intense sexual experience do we create it? AWALT - whatever you do, she can branch swing. 

So, the answer circles back to whoever reads this. It’s what YOU want. If you want young bodies you should SKEW your sexual strategy to seek out thrill seeking women. If you want a mother for your kids, you should TILT your strategy to attract someone who hates going out for a ONS. 

So instead of going through the ups and downs of dating, really think about the type of women you want to attract. If you’re building a home on shitty soil, it won’t be sturdy. AKA: don’t make a hoe a housewife. If you want fun women, don’t always be available - she wants the fuckboy she can throw away who isn’t holding her back from finding a better guy at the sexual marketplace. If you’re Johnny Depp focus on frame. If you aren’t Johnny Depp, become Johnny Depp (perceived desirable alpha). 

TL;DR: Remember dating and sex is meant to be fun, so enjoy never ending road to becoming an ironclad alpha. Women have many things on their mind - understand it but do not revolve your life around it.",1657645577.0

I read those words in another post here, and it just so perfectly summarizes what I have learned through my 27 years of living. I started to make this a reply, but it developed into more of a post in length. 

If you want to obtain the things you truly want in life, you HAVE to internalize this statement. You HAVE to realize that things won’t just magically get better down the road. When I was younger, I had a bad habit of having this fantasy that things would just magically fall into place in the future. That I would somehow become more confident and more successful. Somehow, it would just happen. As with a lot of our thoughts, writing it out on “paper” makes me realize how foolish that was of me to think. 

The thing is, those things we dream about will never happen if we don’t live in the present and start putting in the work TODAY. And no one can do that except for you. The  “lucky breaks” that we see others get are very often the result of internalized self-belief and confidence. Those things can only truly be internalized through putting the work in day in and day out, until you KNOW that you can go the distance. 

I honestly believe that once you have acquired the skill set, and more importantly mindset, to get one “lucky break”, you can repeat that over and over. That’s why things seem to snowball for people after they have that first taste of success. In other words, they aren’t really lucky breaks, but the result of the internal state of mind you’ve cultivated. Look at the people who seem to be truly confident. Notice how they seem to get the best results time and time again. And when they do come up short, it doesn’t cause them to go into a tailspin. 

To the above point, one more thing to add: I’ve also been guilty of trying to change my whole life in a day. I’m sure a lot of us have been there over the course of our journeys. We get a surge of motivation, and try to implement all of these great habits at once. After a few weeks, or even months, our motivation inevitably wanes. Instead of trying to dial back what we’re doing, we get discouraged and drop everything altogether.

So don’t worry about figuring everything out at once. For most of us, life is long. We have YEARS to figure this shit out. That is one good thing about being a man, we tend to gain value as we age, as opposed to losing it like women. Start small: a healthy meal here, a quick workout of compound movements there. Try talking to someone new once a week. So on and so forth. 

No matter what anyone says, the population of men (or people in general) willing to do what is hard to achieve what they desire is getting smaller and smaller. Life is precious y’all. Get out there and make the most of it.",1657201061.0

I see that in the posts that get upvotes and the questions that get asked.

The way common fucking sense is challenged.

Some of you guys reading this are very much asleep.

There are some who are starting to see the reality and are way too fucking angry.

Some anger is OK. After all, you were sold a lie. 

You were told that you can be yourself and you'll find a woman who will love you. You were told that women are equal to men but should be protected. You were told that out there among all the loose women there was a vestal virgin who will be your own personal maid, sex worker, lover, chef, friend, mother to your kids and she'll stay with you forever.

Because you are special.

Pick up any book, movie, anime, comic, fable, etc.

Look at the ideal woman and relationship and realize that that is a fantasy.

She's not going to wait for you when you go away overseas. She's not a virgin who saved herself for you. She's not to stay with you forever. She's not your best friend, a replacement for your mother and your own personal whore all in one.

How can she be?

Not only is that shit one hell of a task but it's also fraught with challenges from her environment, the dogma taught to her and the family and friends she keeps.

So, wake up.

I say this time and time again because it's true. There's not much aside from minor nuances that any vet can say that hasn't been posted and immortalized in the side bar.

So why so many of you can't be bothered isn't because of her or feminism but because you're too fucking lazy to be bothered.

You're too fucking lazy to pick up weights and get stronger because it's hard.

You're too fucking scared to approach a stranger because it's new.

You're too fucking stupid to realize that no one here can change your life but you.

Life is hard, scary and risky. If all you do is read theory than you'll never do anything.

You've just discovered a new way to cope with failure.

You want shit. That requires work to attain. Nature doesn't give a fuck about how you feel.

Ground your expectations with reality and calculate what you can sacrifice for what you want.

Finally, go out there and try shit.

Take risks and put effort into yourself.

If we can all pool our experiences and create a fucking guide to getting the girl(s), making bank money and living the life but you can't be bothered to open the fucking book because you'd rather debate and it requires you to go outside and do shit...

Why should you deserve anything other than misery and frustration?

58,The story of Michael,197,vr2fk2,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vr2fk2/the_story_of_michael/,102,"[This](https://dalrock.wordpress.com/2012/11/24/more-grim-news-for-carousellers-hoping-to-jump-at-the-last-minute/#comment-62160) is a comment from 2012 on Dalrock's site. A story of what happens to the average, BP, high-income geeky guy, whose imaginary world slowly starts to crumble as he goes through college.

&#x200B;

Hello. Is there an introduction board for this website? My name is Michael. I’ve been reading this website for 3 days. I’m shocked to see everything I’ve experiencing written in such a perfectly stated way. Never before have I seen a blog/media outlet so perfectly written. The writer is surely a genius. I’m amazed and relived to see so many responses. It means I’m not alone.

I’m 32 years old and have never been married. Unfortunately (or fortunately I’m not sure which anymore at this point) I have no kids. I am single and alone and not dating anyone. I live in Los Angeles. My income was $120,000.00 (net earnings after creative deductions and business taxes) in 2011. Income is projected to be $170,000.00 (net earnings after business taxes) in 2012. I’m exactly the kinds of “independent man” women claim they want. I drive a luxury car with an amazing apartment in Los Angeles directly on the beach. It’s quite a panty moistener and costs me $6,000.00 per month. I work from home because an office would cost at least another $2,000.00 month. I keep in great shape. Gym 3-4 a week + running + organic diet (I spend $700-$900.00 a month on organic foods and supplements) I was raised in a Christian “7th Heaven” (old TV show) type household. We always went to church. Strong hard working father figure was always present for me and my siblings. I went to private school, university, law school, and then started my own practice at 28 years old.

My parents met and married in college. They have been married for 39 years. And it hurts me to the core to be 32 and unmarried. Alone. Without a loving wife. I feel pain from it every single day. It’s like a sharp invisible dagger constantly stabbing at me. But perhaps I’m part of the problem listed in the graphs above. Let me explain why:

I went to the same college my parents met and married at. I was hoping to meet marry and settle down. Instead I was met with hundreds young college aged women who were NOT interested in marriage. They were interested in: 1) Partying 2) Having sex. College was 24/7 fuck fest. At first I was able to begrudgingly “socialize” in this element. What do I mean by “this element” within this context? College: Extreme social promiscuity, cheating, drama, drugs, and parties. I was an observer but NEVER a direct participant because my heart would not let me. This eventually caused me to stick out as a third wheel observer on campus. Someone who was always “not mixing” or “participating”. As a result I never enjoyed the benefits. I rarely dated. Instead I was sneered at. Cute girls flicked their fingers at me. I was used by women as a person to tell their problems to. I was passed over. I was seen as “weak “lame” and “boring”. I was ignored in the hallways, library, classes, by these women. And it didn’t help I was cash strapped broke working a minimum wage job and eating Raman noodles..

The vast majority of these young hot girls vigorously pursued college life sex like you would not believe. They had sex with a large variety of guys. What I personally call “lily padding”. These girls did anything and anyone in the name of “fun” (fun=parties, fun= sex with new people, fun= drugs, fun= raves, fun = frat party etc.

It hurt me to watch these girls go out of their way to pursue and spread their legs for complete losers. COMPLETE LOSERS. I’m talking: Hi I work in a carnival part time, I’m covered in tattoos, I have no job, I failed my minimum wage drug test and I’m in a band. These guys were losers. Some did not even go to the college! They would hop a bus stay with friends and get laid THAT NIGHT.

Many nights I could not sleep because of the girls getting fucked hard… 1,2,3,4 dorms down. The dorms were old military barracks from the 1940’s with vents through the ceilings. It was very loud. All the time. I remember how much it hurt to be rejected by one girl in particular I had my open hopeless romantic heart set on… We had allot in common. I pursued her like a complete gentlemen – and was eventually turned down. That same weekend after getting turned down I got to hear her getting fucked hard and loud in the room next door. The guy who lived there was a super scraggly unattractive heavy drug user covered in tattoos majoring in “music studies”. This girl was young hot thin beautiful in her physical prime. I never said anything. But I felt so hurt she turned me down for casual sex with a guy like that.This guy was very open about his exploits with her and told me not to worry because practically every guy he knew fucked her. As the years passed the same thing happened again and again, and again and again, in various ways with all kinds of unrelated girls. What I mean is: I was looking for a LTR leading to marriage. I would meet trade numbers talk and “feel” a girl was a good person. Then she would do other guys. Or I would find out things like this. When this kind of thing happens to me over and over all through my life….it hurts me and makes me doubt senses. What is wrong with me that my heart is telling me she is a good person when she is clearly not?

As time went on I was labeled “husband material” by the girls on my campus. This phrase continued to plague me into my late 20’s. This label resulted in ZERO DATES all through college. I wasn’t “down with it”. I wasn’t “participating” etc (sex, drugs, parties, etc.) My heart wasn’t into it. So I wasn’t entitled to any of the benefits (having sex with young attractive girls in their prime etc.). However party guys, flash in a pan athletes, loser guys in bands, wanna be DJ’s and self-professed “club promoters” – were ALWAYS getting these girls at their youngest hottest physical prime. Basically the more of a loser the guy was… the more these women would have sex with them. Hot sorority girls flocked to Football players like a butterfly’s on a beast. It didn’t even matter if the guy was black. College athletes did not even TRY to get laid.

One night I had enough. I confronted a room of 8-10 gorgeous white girls. These girls were 18-24 years old. I asked them if they planned to get married. All seemed to say more or less – YES. I asked what their future husband would think about their behavior. I was immediately met with hostility. I was told the future husband would “never know” and “it’s none of his business”. The girls said they knew exactly what they were doing and were planning to “have their fun” (fun= partying, fun=sex, fun=going on spring break etc.) and would “settle down later”. I asked: when are you planning to settle down? They said: “It depends” and “probably around 27, 28” or “maybe sooner it depends”. I really put the girls on the spot. During our exchange they saw I was upset. They told me I should be happy because “nice guys finish first in the end”. I told them you cannot have your cake and eat it to. Then I was told by Kaylene (a young thin super sexy blonde with curves in all the right places (who BTW refused to date me even though we were friends and according to her roommate had sex with almost 30 guys in one semester ) she told me “Michael let me tell you something: not only am I going to have my cake eat it and eat it too. I’m going to have it with ice cream and sprinkles”. All of the girls laughed and smiled in agreement.

I thought things would change after college. They didn’t.

Now at 32 and successful these women are hitting me. In my mind these are the same women who rejected me. I’m not interested. The Bible says something to the effect of “don’t forsake the wife of your youth” or something like “remember your young wife”? Something like that. How am I supposed to remember something I never had? I have no history with these women. Ticking ovaries are scandalous. They will lie and say anything to get what they want. Which is: BABIES AND A LOVING HUSBAND TO PAY THEIR BILLS. Yet these women did not even give a few good years of their youth!

As a man I am very visual. God made me this way. I cannot help finding a physically beautiful woman attractive. Why did these women not at least give me a few years of their youth so I would have time to fall in love with them and permanently burn their image in my mind’s eye? I need something to remember when we are 50 and married. Yet she spent her 20’s parceling herself out to guys who gave her nothing and offers nothing to the guy who gives her everything. I’m expected to commit hard earned resources to raising children with what is ultimately a suspect woman whose history I know nothing about. A 30+ unmarried women has very high chance of having a questionable past and baggage. I believe the more men a woman has been with the less likely she is to be emotionally committed each subsequent one. When you have handed out little pieces of your heart over years to dozens of different men what is left for the husband you proclaim to truly love? What value do the words “I love you” mean when she has stared into the eyes of 10-100+ different men and said the same thing?

At 30+ women’s physical appearance has nowhere to go but DOWN. Is this what women mean by “saving the best for last”? Marrying at 30+? How can women spend trillions of dollars a year on beauty products yet at the same time claim a women’s age “shouldn’t be important” to a man? And what about children? Did they ever think their husbands might want to have children? What’s more likely to naturally produce a quicker pregnancy and healthy offspring? A fertile 24 year old in her physical prime… or a 35 year old aging womb? What if I want multiple children? At 30+ a women can easily before infertile after her first pregnancy.As a result of everything I’ve seen and experienced in my life I would like to make an announcement to all the desperate 30+ year old women out there: I would rather suffocate and die then spend my hard earned income, love, trust, and substance on you. Your entitled, ageing, feminist, jaded, baggage laden and brainwashed. And if I cannot marry a women in her 20’s I REFUSE TO EVER GET MARRIED. Given my high income this should not be a problem. However I’m concerned at some point I will have to start looking overseas (Ukraine, Russia, Eastern Europe etc.). I’m not going to marry one of these 30+ ageing entitled females who clearly have an agenda of their own. I intend to get married once. Marriage is meant to be forever. I will not be a starter husband for one of these used up women. I can’t tell you the number of men I’ve known who married late and were rewarded by losing everything they spent their lives building…

59,Are you making her orgasm ?,197,vqt3bs,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vqt3bs/are_you_making_her_orgasm/,43,"Do you know how to make a woman orgasm? Do you know how to use your hands? Mouth? Dick? Combination of these things? What is squirting? Are there different types of squiring? Do you know when a woman fakes an orgasm? Are you sure? Are there different types of orgasm?

I see a lot of information about self-improvement and dating strategy but I found almost nothing on this topic here. To use a 'dog chasing a car' analogy... TRP can teach you to how to catch the car but very little about how to drive a car once you catch it. Thus, I thought I'll make a post.

***TL;DR*** ***Touch her clitoris with your hand (specifically your three/four fingers - no thumb) while you are fucking her. Thats pretty much the gist of it. Find sex positions that allow you to touch her clitoris with your hand while you fuck her (eg. her back is on your chest). Most women are different and thus you will need to make the necessary adjustment's regarding hand movement(eg. circular, side to side, etc ), speed (some women like it super fast/medium/slow), pressure (eg light/medium/hard) and if you should or shouldn't include the clitoral hood as protection between your hands and clit. Hand movement might need to be different at the start than at the end.*** [this](https://www.xvideos.com/video28088891/orgasm_compilation) ***is how it looks like. THIS TIP IS THE MOST SIMPLE AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE (IMO). TADAAA this is how most women actually orgasm during sex. Read on if interested.***

*Disclaimer: I am by no means an 'expert' on this topic (who would really be an expert and how would you verify/measure that I do not know). I will admit that I have likely MUCH more to learn. However, I've been with my fair share of women. My guess would be that I slept with 80+ women. I had multiple long term relationships, fwb, multiple fwb at the same time, threesomes and one poly relationship. Nevertheless, if you think you can educate me/correct me and improve my knowledge on this topic, I sincerely and humbly invite you to do so in the comments.*

*Warning: This topic is quite complex and thus it's very difficult to summarise it into one post. I will forget things. I will organise things inefficiently... I will make mistakes. Sex is more like alchemy than chemistry and thus its hard to create a play-by-play..*

# 1. Intro

*Why make this post? Women don't orgasm with most men. Do not be one of those men!*

I like to be open about sex in my relationships. What do I mean by this? I mean.. I like to talk about everything with a woman regarding sex. Specifically, I like when women do majority of the talking. I want them to talk about fantasies, kinks, previous relationships. everything. Moreover, I like to talk about this topic without any judgement. I've been told multiple times that I am very easy to talk to about this stuff and that I do NOT put pressure on them to be a certain way sexually/shame them.

I've been told by women that they had gang bangs, they were raped/molested, had sex with a 'semi-close' relative (just to name a few rare unsavoury ones). However, one of the things I hear a lot about is the lack of orgasms that women experience. This ranges from women who never had an orgasm (and don't really masturbate), women who masturbate and don't orgasm, women who never orgasmed during sex (or are not sure), women who orgasmed during sex only a handful of times, and women who only make themselves orgasm during sex using their own hand ( I dont count grinding clit into abs to orgasm into this category) .

I would say 70+ percent of women I met fall into this category and ALMOST ALL of them told me that they faked it and lied about it to their lovers. I've been told a LOT of times that they simply fake it and that their lovers never really ask about it. I would say half of these women told me they never really had a conversation about sex with their boyfriends/lovers. I've been told a lot that if they don't fake it their lover just gets either disappointed or angry. Many times leading to a break up (e.g ""I made women orgasm before.. If I cant make you orgasm, it must mean we are just not compatible sexually""). Their explanation is that it's far easier to just fake it. This tells me that there are a lot of women who do not orgasm during sex. Just go on google scholar and type ""women"",""report"" and ""orgasm"" if you want the science. It seems that my anecdotal experience is in line with scientific findings.

# 2. Short overview of female anatomy and types of orgasms

To preface this, there is a lot o debate about different types of orgasms and about female anatomy (relating to orgasm context). For example, there is a debate if vaginal and clitoral orgasms are different. Another one is the existence of a g-spot .

**Anatomy:** I will not be describing the whole female anatomy and will focus on the most important parts. You can find an image of both on the websites linked.

[*Clitoris*](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326403#what-is-it)

[*G-spot*](https://thevelvetbox.com/health-wellness/the-g-spot/)

Anatomy discussion: There are many parts of the vagina + surrounding areas that can be pleasurable and thus orgasm inducing. Such as inter thighs, labia, taint, anus and many more. However, these will not be discussed in this short overview. Clitoris and g spot are the main focus here.

Is g spot connected to clitoris? Do your own research to decide. IMO, yes. Clitoris is a much larger structure than a small little clitoris head (tho majority of nerves are there). It's parts connect inward into the vagina and this is what we call a g spot. Define them how you want, however, these two area are generally considered the pleasure areas of female anatomy.

**Types of orgasm:** There is a debate in this area too, however, I'll divide them into 3 categories

*Clitoris orgasm* \- It is an orgasm that is achieved through clitoral stimulation

*Vaginal* \- Orgasm achieved through vaginal stimulation

*Other* \- Orgasm achieved through other parts of the body. Kissing, nipples, ass, anus, anal etc. This type of orgasm is fucking useless to focus on in this post imo. Apart from anal... this type of orgasm is extremely rare. Thus, it will not be discussed here any further.

Orgasm discussion: IMO most orgasms involve some part of the clitoris. It's either the clitoral head, outerior parts of the clitoris (e.g labia) and interior (g spot).

# 3. Orgasm

In my opinion, female ability to orgasm is the result of physical and emotional sexual stimulation, her anatomy and her past experience. You cannot influence her anatomy (you can adjust accordingly however) or pervious sexual experiences, and thus I will focus on physical and emotional stimulation. The hardest part of a non orgasmic woman is the first orgasm. Why? Well, did you cum the first time you jerked off? Or was it a gradual process until you figured it out? If a woman did not experience an orgasm during sex, she might be ready to have one. You might not know what to do. Might be too early into a relationship. You might not be attractive enough.

# 4. Barriers to female orgasm

**A. Her fault**

* She might not be psychologically ready
   * anxiety
   * cant relax
   * cant let go/submit
* She doesn't know how to give herself one
   * Is too afraid/ashamed to use her hand
   * Doesn't know how to move to make herself orgasm
   * Doesn't know how to grind her clitoris into your body so she can orgasm (this is typically cowgirl position)
* Her biology/hormones are fucked up
   * she truly might not be able to orgasm for what ever reason
   * If she cant make herself orgasm at all... good luck to you..

**B. Your fault**

* You have no idea what you are doing
* You aren't physically attractive enough
* You have severe physical deficiencies
* You can't create the right mood/ are awkward

# 5. Things that help with making women orgasm

BODY

* Penis - Girth/Length/Curve.
   * In my opinion, a larger penis (particularly thicker) has a positive effect on women having an orgasm. Larger penis fills up the vagina better and during insertion it can stimulate different outer parts of the vagina (thicker penis touches the sides of the vagina opening more and this is ""moving"" the whole vagina more). Curvature and angling can help with stimulating the g-spot.
   * If you have a smaller dick, angling and movement are your friends.
* Hot body - Muscles/Smell/Face
   * This is simple. You orgasm faster with a hotter woman. Women are the same. The most I had to control myself (not cum) is with a mixed Brazilian woman with 10/10 body. For those guys reading this who went from fat/twig body to jacked body, compare how women responded to you during sex before and after you got jacked. HIT THE GYM
   * Better face you have, more turned on she is. Testosterone and lower body fat% improves your face. HIT THE GYM
   * You having a masculine smell (or smell that turns her on) will make her more turned on.
* Rhythm
   * Do you suck at dancing? Do you move like an autist that cant even clap his hands in a rhythm? Well... this might be fucking up your sex life. Keeping a solid rhythm is key when you use your hand, mouth and dick. Think about it... When you jerk off, do you randomly change speed and rhythm? Try it. See if it makes you orgasm when you are close to cumming.
* Movement of your body/penis
   * How do you fuck ? Do you only jackhammer like a retard (not saying that there isn't a time and a place for this too tho). Or do you tease? Do you insert your penis only 1/3 in, 2/3 in, 3/3 sometimes? Do you know how to create a build up?
   * Do you know how to grind your lower abs into her clit during missionary ?

MIND

* Anticipation / before foreplay
   * Are you sexual? Are you touching her and making your intentions known?
   * Teasing her
   * What do you do before you become sexual?
   * Do you talk dirty to her ) ?
* Mood
   * Are YOU relaxed?
   * Do you know how to take charge?
   * Can you smoothly move it to sex or are you awkward?
* Foreplay
   * Is your foreplay long enough? (quickie excluded)
   * Are you sufficiently teasing her?
* Sex
   * Are you dominant?
   * Do you talk dirty to her ?
   * Do you use your hands to touch her during sex? Her ass, waist, neck, etc?
   * Are you physical? Pick her up? Fucking her with enthusiasm and passion?

# Actual things that you can do

Keep in mind you need to learn her body. Women are like golf. You need to play each hole little bit differently. However, if you played golf before, you have an idea what to do on different courses.

* Oral
   * A good foreplay built up can do wonders with oral
   * Focus the clit: The clit is where the action is at. You should take care of other vagina parts but the clitoris is the main focus.
   * To be or not to be? To insert your fingers or not? In my experience most women enjoy inserting two fingers inside the vagina to rub the g spot while you do oral. Google how to massage the g spot.
   * Put your whole mouth (lips) on the clitoris. Don't do the porn lick.
   * How to move your tongue? Well, this again depends on a lady. In my experience you typically go around the clitoris with your tongue, side to side, bottom to top or just a kissing motion.
   * What suction pressure to use? Well this again depends on a lady. Some women (ime) like a LOT of suction while some almost none. Moreover, you might need to increase suction gradually.
   * MY best move is to suck the clit like a little dick (yeah thats what the clit is) and do a gentle come here motion on her g spot with my middle and ring finger)
   * There are many more methods that work on some women (e.g tongue going inside vag)
   * Dont be afraid to lick pussy when she is in doggy style position (you lick her from the back). I had women who could only cum that way
* Hands
   * Come here motion with two fingers when stimulating the g spot as previously mentioned in oral section. (only this time you can be kissing her/ kissing her tits etc)
   * Google how to make a woman squirt with hands. You basically make the same motion as above just faster, shakier and stronger.
   * Clitoris: this depends which way are you facing her clit
      * Palm on her stomach fingers on clit ->> Best way to use hands imo. It's the one from TLDR. Why is it the best? It's the angle of hand she uses to masturbate. Thus, this is the one she is the most prepared for.
      * The opposite way ->> I typically use my thumb
   * Massage her anus opening. Only the opening at first (if you do anal play)
* Dick
   * Interesting Rhythm
   * Angle (towards g-spot)
   * Good movement
   * Grinding into her clitoris with your abs

Ok I m done. I might edit (or add) some things later on but this is a decent introduction into the topic. It took me 4.5 hours to write this, which for me is roughly 200 euros wasted. Hope it wasn't a total waste.

Edit: I am not saying you need to do a lot of this stuff. When my girlfriend wakes me up in the middle of the night to fuck, I don't do anything other than put saliva on my hand, insert my dick and fuck. I dont talk dirty, there was no foreplay/built up.. I just move my body how I know she likes it. She cums. I go back to sleep (sometimes I don't even cum). This isn't some instruction manual. I don't really think about this stuff when I have sex. It comes naturally. It's like jerking off. You just know what you are doing after a while. However, making her orgasm for the first time is the real hurdle to get over. Here all the extras can be quite helpful.",1656888335.0
60,I thought you all might enjoy this old experience,308,vqkk01,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vqkk01/i_thought_you_all_might_enjoy_this_old_experience/,60,"So let me start by saying I have two friends in this story. Good looking friend ""Jon"" and average looking friend ""Ron"". Jon was always wanted by every girl growing up. He could fart loudly and still get a girls number without trying. Ron was like most of us he won some and lost some. There was a girl I had as a friend named ""Kelsie"" growing up. I never saw her in a romantic way but she was about average attraction wise. So Ron met her and developed a huge crush. She gave him her number and he ended up texting her at night after work. Ron said nothing weird or sexual. Kelsie later comes to me and says she regrets giving her number out and that Ron gives her creepy vibes. I saw the texts from both phones and there was nothing wrong.

Fast forward Kelsie had developed a major crush on Jon like all other women who have crossed paths with him. Now Kelsie hunted for his number through various people who knew him and got it. She never directly got it from him as he had made an excuse not to give it to her. Now before this final part let me just say Jon had a very beautiful girlfriend and everyone knew he was not single. Kelsie texted him at night...not with a ""hello"" or a ""whats up"" like Ron had sent her. No the first thing she sends to Jon is a straight up nude and says ""I find you very attractive...DTF?"".

Ironically Ron the less good looking one was consideres a creep for polite normal texts and for getting her number the proper way. Yet Kelsie hunted for Jon's number from outside sources and maybe even the internet...then proceeds to send a straight nude to someone who already has a girlfriend without even a ""hello"". Yet she does not consider her behavior creepy. But Ron was creepy for just being nice and normal. Society has a messed up perspective depending on who you are.",1656863568.0
61,Provision Is Essential To Manhood,0,vqytzv,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vqytzv/provision_is_essential_to_manhood/,22,"**TL;DR: Become a provider in the sense that you secure your influence and power to attract women because it's masculine.**

Some background - I found this sub years and years ago. I'm familiar with the sidebar and the mantras. I visit from time to time now. As I continue to develop myself more as a men's online magazine owner and writer I hope to contribute when possible. I welcome the criticism and barbs. 

What I aim to address in this post is the propensity from other members to often misconstrue provision as feminine or 'beta' behavior by: selling exciting anecdotes about homeless men or prison convicts achieving incredible success with women, painting financial success as an unessential aspect of becoming successful with women, and illustrating with persuasive argument that money can be substituted by game or looks.

What many fail to understand is that success with women is achieved in degrees and attraction is not homogenous. That is to say - money creates a different type of attraction or psychological behavior. That's not obvious to the average man I'd argue. The attraction to a man with muscles is not the same for a handsome, suave intelligent one. Optimally, we want the full experience of a woman's attraction and sexual interest hence the striving to become a well-rounded alpha. What we witness in real life is an endless testimony of men maxing out one criterion or combination of criteria that attract women and espouse that to be the secret ingredient. Muscles, game, height, looks, status, intelligence, and money all produce different types of sexual attraction in women, and it is a beautiful thing. The song and dance of improving those aspects of ourselves and putting it on the market is truly remarkable. 

Money signals one of the core tenets of manhood for women and their biological makeup: provision. It's a trope in this sub to condescend the ideal of becoming a provider. She'll never give you the sexual experience she'll give the man who treats her like a whore, and on and on. That's very immature, surface-level idolizing. Provision is essential to manhood. You must provide for yourself. You must provide for your family. My grandfather had 8 children as a farmer. He wasn't rich, but he was a provider. I'm sure he didn't spare an expense once in a while to roll in the hay. Becoming the provider makes you more dominant, more assertive, and if it doesn't then you know money was not the issue in your relationship with women. You're not getting the sex you want because you do not know your value.

You can be tall, handsome, muscular, charming, financially successful even. However, if you are not a provider and fulfilling that instinctive aspect of your manhood and masculinity - you will not get the full experience of a woman's sexual interest. Blowing all your money on nice things for yourself is alright if you've made sure you've taken care of the people who are your foundation, your power base. That doesn't always mean family. That could mean a CEO who gives his employees a raise instead of buying a new Corvette.

I'm not saying pay her bills, take her out to fancy dates, buy her things, or sell yourself as a secure bet. I'm saying you should take care of your family, your base, or your community as an essential element of securing your influence and power. So do what you want with your money, but consider becoming a provider as a crucial element of your masculinity and see if it doesn't change your behavior towards women in a more successful way.",1656907848.0

The benefits of working here aside from the discounts is the amount of attractive girls that come in daily.
I’m ngl, I’m pretty good looking. I’m 6ft, jacked, black, got good facial hair, nice smile and I’m a good conversationalist which is why I’ve been killing it in sales.
So every now and then When a girl that catches my eye comes in I try to transition the conversation away from sales to see if they’re interested l. I’ve gotten a few numbers.

So this one chick that came In a few weeks back might be the most attractive one I’ve seen.
She’s about 5’3, super petite fit body with a bubble but, light brown hair, green eyes. She came in wearing the tiniest shorts ever and asked me a question about protein supps. We ended up vibing and talking for like an hour. She works at the gym in the same plaza. I got her number.
At some point during our text she mentioned she has a boyfriend.
So here’s the catch, I told her straight up that I’m into her and she said she’s into me too and still wants to chill.
We ended up getting coffee and we’re hanging out again soon and we’ve been talking.

The other day however, I ran into her at our store and she was with this guy who I presume is her man.
Her and I spoke normally, but I can tell she was tryna keeping it on the lows about us.

So I got a look at the guy and he seems like a total cuck. 
I can tell just by their body language and dynamic that he doesn’t fuck her right.

So her and I are linking up on Wednesday and get this, her bf was never ever mentioned since that one time.
In fact, when she was at the store with him I would notice her starring at me from afar nearly breaking her neck.

So this won’t be the first time that I been talking to a girl with a man, but it is the first time it’s happened like this.

She’s super into fitness and so am I and I can tell she has one thing for the “Tyrone” archetype.
It seems to me like he’s very Abercrombie and finch and in a way not that manly. He’s super skinny pretty boy type and I can tell she probably cheats all the time.

How often do you guys deal with girls like this?

Do most women step out and get it from other guys when they’re in relationships?",1656460113.0
64,[FIELD REPORT] Pulled a blonde girl from a gay club,79,vmnlsy,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vmnlsy/field_report_pulled_a_blonde_girl_from_a_gay_club/,46,"**Stats:**

Age: 28

Race: Eastern Asian

Height: 5'7

Location: Las Vegas

**Preface:** I've been scaling back on game in the last 2 weeks. I think it's due to a mixture of feeling like I'm plateauing and getting burnt out from the clubs. I still love doing this but I gotta change it up. To combat the plateauing issue, I'm going to resume this course I bought when I first started game (todd v verbal game academy for those wondering). I'm also going to try different venues. The clubs are getting repetitive and 90% of the girls are tourist. I want to meet more local girls which led me to the gay club.

The gay club has it's perks. It's a very sex positive environment with essentially no competition. There are still some attractive girls. Volume isn't as high as the night clubs but that's expected. Another thing is that the gay club ""peaks"" later on at night. So what I've been doing the last two weekends is that I go to the regular clubs from 11-1 or 2am and then head over to the gay club which goes on until 4am whereas regular clubs are dying down by 2:30-3am. I've actually been finding better results at the gay club these last two weekends.

**Sets:**

1. I see this very hot white girl walking across the dance floor by herself. I open with a push pull per usual. Turns out she's canadian. I've hooked up with a few canadian girls recently so I use my past reference experience to make cold reads on her. I essentially make cold reads until the set hooks and then try to find jump off points to a more genuine and authentic conversation/interaction. The set hooked pretty quickly, within 2 minutes. We're just talking about canada related topics. This whole time we're chatting, I'm doing incremental physical escalation to calibrate how receptive she is. I could tell she likes me so I grab her hand and tell her ""come dance with me"". She complies and we're now grinding front to front. About a minute in, I go for the make out. Now we're making out. We're grinding and making out for a good 5 minutes. Then she tells me she has to find her brother and friends. I grab her number and we part ways. I didnt mind too much. That was my first set at the gay club and the night was still young.

&#x200B;

2. Hot black girl at the corner with her 3 friends. She had a very attractive face along with a banging body. I walked pass her friends and opened her with a push pull. I'm feeling pretty confident at this point since I just made out with the canadian girl (set 1) so I go for higher risk direct verbals. She's smiling and giggling. I could tell she's feeling me but I wanted a verbal transition into a kiss so I ask her ""have you ever kissed a cute asian boy before?"". She says no and I go in for the kiss. It works. Her male gay cousin enters the set and I introduce myself. I tell the whole group ""let's all go to the dance floor"". They agree. I grab her by her hand and lead to the dance floor. Now we're grinding. 5 minutes in I try to isolate. She said she can't leave her friends but told me to text her since she lives in Vegas. I grab her number and bounce.

&#x200B;

3. I see a hot blonde girl standing with friends on the second floor balcony. I approach and open her. I make a couple cold reads until it hooks. Turns out she has a thing for asian guys. Her ex of 3 years was asian. She's receptive towards the physical escalation and introduced me to her friend. I chatted with her friend a little bit for group management purposes. Then I tell her ""let's all go to the dance floor"". She agrees and I lead her to the dance floor. Once we're there, I take her hand and slowly bring her closer to me and now we're grinding. I go in for the make out. Success.

We dance for like 2-3 minutes and then her whole group shows up. They were friendly and engaging me so I was chatting with them. Just more group management. Basically, for the next 20-30 minutes, I'm chatting with her group and grinding with her. I knew the next step was to isolate so I told her ""hey let's go outside, it's hella hot in here"". She agrees and tells her group that she's going outside with me.

We sit outside and just chat. No game-y shit here. Just a genuine conversation. We chat for 10 minutes and then her friends show up. By now, I've seeded the pull multiple times already. I've told her to come hang out with me at my place afterwards 3 times at different points during the night. So after her friends joined us outside, I was just sitting back and seeing how this plays out. From their conversation, I could tell she was gonna come home with me so I just kept it cool. Continue to build rapport with her friends. Her friends left and I'm like SWEET. I tell her aight let's head out, take her hand, and led her out of the club. We get back to my place and yall know how it goes ;)

**Key Take Aways:**

1. Be open minded: Gay clubs are great but I know alot of dudes would write them off because it’s not a conventional venue. Dont write off a venue or idea just because it’s unorthodox. One thing game has taught me is to be more open minded. Anything can work. Just because something sounds unconventional, lame, or cringe to you, doesnt mean it doesnt work. Field test it and see for yourself. For example, the cute asian boy line. I sometime get hate for that line because it’s cRiNgE but I also get hella results from that line.
2. Dont get complacent: just like anything else in life, game is something you can always keep learning and get better at. Im feeling like Im plateauing so I've decided to resume the course I bought months ago. There’s always room for improvement.
3. Don't rely on indicators of interests (IOIs): I constantly see people advising other men to look for IOIs which is so inefficient and dumb. This blonde girl had ZERO idea of my existence until I opened her. Turns out I'm just her type. If I was relying on IOIs then I would have never pulled her. You wanna know if she's attracted to you? Go fucking talk to her and find out. That's how. Fuck IOIs.
4. Lead: Noticed how I always lead in all my sets. Just lead.
5. Group management: I don't really do this often but for set 3 I did. Nothing fancy. Just build rapport and gain their approval. I personally dont really like group management because it bores me but I guess it did help in set 3. They were willing to leave her with me.
6. Seed the pull: Before the blonde girl and her friends parted way at the end of the night, I've already tried for the pull multiple times. You should always seed the pull or try for the pull before the ""end"" of the night. I was trying for the pull since we were on the dance floor. This way, by the time her friends joined us outside again, there's no confusion on her part. If she doesn't leave with her friends then we all know what's up.",1656423809.0
65,How to be Dominant,227,vlwxz2,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vlwxz2/how_to_be_dominant/,45,"Note: This is a draft from my upcoming book so I am looking for criticisms, stories I could add, real world examples, etc.

The alpha male is dominant, which simply means he gives the orders and does not take orders. Dominance is only a question of who gives the orders – you can have more money than a woman, be smarter than her, taller than her, etc.., but if she successfully gives you orders more than you give her orders, she is dominant, not you.

As discussed earlier, women have a deep, subconscious drive to want to be dominated by the alpha male, because being dominated allows the woman to enter the alpha male’s world and enjoy a superior emotional experience. If the alpha male is a good leader, the woman feels safe, protected, and like she can offload the risks and responsibilities of the adventure onto the alpha male. Imagine you were in a burning building and a firefighter showed up to help lead you out of the building – you would listen to everything the firefighter said because you would be afraid that if you disobeyed his commands you would get swallowed by the fire. In the same way, women subconsciously feel like if the alpha male is not in charge, she must face the unknown and the threats therein on her own. 

Women also want to obey the alpha male because he is the most competent and fearless member of the tribe, so listening to him will cause them to have more fun. If you like basketball and had the opportunity to be coached by Michael Jordan, you would let Jordan tell you what to do because you knew that following his orders would make you a better basketball player. For the same reason, women feel an impulse to follow the alpha’s commands. With you in charge, she is assured she is pursuing the best purpose, the “team” (you and her) will succeed, and the tribe will not judge her or reject her for what she is doing.

Women also want to be dominated because women subconsciously have a desire to make the alpha male happy. Women subconsciously feel like if the alpha male is doing whatever he wants and not taking orders from her, he is more likely to accept her into the tribe. In a weird way, the more random and arbitrary the alpha male acts, the more safe and secure women feel in their acceptance. 

Dominance does not mean you get to be mean, pushy, abusive, annoying, or overbearing. Women do not want to be dominated by a guy who makes their emotional experience worse. If you re a loser eating Cheetos and watching Friends reruns, no woman will want to take orders from her. If you are making her do things which make her feel bad, or if your emotional experience is boring, corny, or shitty for whatever reason, women would rather leave your tribe and face the unknown on their own. As just like woman have a powerful desire to be dominated by the alpha male, they have just as strong a desire to NOT be dominated by men they do not perceive as the alpha male. Giving yourself completely to a man makes you weak and vulnerable, so the last thing evolution wants is for a woman to completely place her fate in the hands of a weak, indecisive, beta male. 

Women, therefore, only want to follow a man’s orders after she has emotionally invested in him as the alpha male. And a woman will only emotionally invest in a man as the alpha male after she has tested his emotional experience to ensure it is fun, safe, and reliable. You cannot walk up to a woman in a bar you do not know and put a BDSM collar on her; she needs to buy into your emotional experience first. If a woman is sucking your dick in the bedroom, and you say “turn around and let me fuck you from behind you little slut,” she will get turned on. But if you say that to a cashier at Whole Foods you just met, she will call the police.

Establishing dominance, therefore, requires patience because you can and should only give a woman orders after she WANTS to take orders from you. This takes time – before you can give a woman a command, you must wait until she has emotionally invested in you enough to want to follow that command. As she slowly emotionally invests, you give her bigger and bigger orders. For example, if you approach a woman in a bar you cannot immediately say “let’s go back to my apartment” – she is not emotionally invested enough in you to leave with you yet. Instead, when you approach you have a nice conversation, and then when you sense she is emotionally invested enough in the conversation, you can say “hey let’s walk over here where it is less loud.” Bam! You have now given her a command that she has followed. Later, when the woman emotionally invests in you enough to want to go to a different venue with you, you can say “let’s go to this other bar across the street.” Bam! She has now followed another command! Every time you give her a command and she follows it, she grows more emotionally invested (bonus points if following your command causes something fun and positive to happen). You keep this cycle going until the commands become more serious, all the way until you are instructing her about sex positions. 

There is, however, a balance here. Women will resist following your commands at first as they shit test you to determine if your emotional experience is worth joining. But the moment the woman has emotionally invested enough to want to take orders from you, you must quickly capitalize and be firm, assertive, and confident. If a woman makes clear she wants you to lead her, and you bullshit on taking the lead, she will lose attraction and go elsewhere. 

If you are clever, you can get a woman to emotionally invest in you more quickly by giving her small little orders she does not even notice. For example, you can say things like “hey can you hold my a drink for a second while I check my phone?” or “hey can you grab me a beer from the fridge?” So long as her rational mind does not notice you are “giving her orders” she will comply and subconsciously emotionally invest in a tiny bit. You can also give these kinds of micro-orders in a conversation. If a woman is telling you about how she bakes a cookie, you can say “oh, cool, what’s your recipe?” If she tells you the recipe, she has followed a command you have given her. 

You must also maintain dominance in conversations. You must lead the conversation, choose the topics, and changing the subject when it gets boring, stupid, or otherwise uninteresting. You should also avoid agreeing with everything she says. And of course, you should also refuse to comply with commands related to conversation as well. For example, if you are an accountant and a woman asks you for accounting advice before she has done anything to deserve it, your answer should be “no.”

The key to dominance is consent. On a conscious, rational level, nobody wants to be told what to do. Women especially hate being controlled because every beautiful woman has had some corny, boring, insecure guy ruin her emotional experience by keeping her from doing fun things she enjoyed doing. When beautiful women dump their boyfriends, they often complain that he was controlling, possessive, and cramped their emotional experience.

Womens’ desire for domination exists on a subconscious level, so your domination of her must happen subtly, subconsciously, and smoothly in the natural flow of the interaction. In other words, you must give orders without looking like you are trying to give orders. You do not establish dominance by yelling “I make the rules in this house bitch!!” or by forcing your dominance on women. You establish dominance by creating a fun emotional experience, enjoying that emotional experience, and then slowly allowing women to enter that emotional experience after they emotionally invest in you by doing things for you. A woman should never feel like you are trying to tell her what to do – if anything, women should feel like you are reluctant to allow her into your world and give her orders. Like everything you provide, your dominance is a gift and she must feel like she must work to obtain it. 

For example, if a woman asks my advice on something, I sometimes say “I don’t like to tell women what to do, but what I would do is…” or if a woman asks what we are doing I say, “I’m gonna go to Jimmy’s, you can come if you want.” Womens’ acceptance of my dominance is purely voluntary, and they can get off the train at any time. And when women know they are free to leave whenever they want, they are more likely to want to join. 

Men have a natural desire to be the alpha and dominate, and often get impatient and give orders too soon, before the woman has emotionally invested enough. For example, I once saw a guy text a woman before a first date: “Wear a cute, slutty dress to our date” and the woman replied “I will wear whatever the fuck I want.” The guy made a rookie mistake – he tried to give her orders before she was emotionally invested enough to want to take them. His attempt at giving orders was also too obvious and visible to her rational mind, so her red flags went up. You must be careful because women are much more attuned to power games than men are, and usually notice when you are trying to establish dominance before they are ready.  

You should also be careful about telling women how to live their lives. If a woman is a communist, majors in left-handed puppetry, smokes cigarettes, or tries to cure her cancer with patchouli oil, telling her she is making bad life choices will not get her to change her behavior. Women often subconsciously interpret friendly, reasonable advice as an attempt to control her and violently resist if they have not emotionally invested in the man giving the advice (and think about it – a woman needs to emotionally invest in you A LOT to make major life decisions like stop smoking or being a communist because of you). Unless the stupid thing she is doing is small and easily fixable, just nod and smile as she tells you how she is ruining your life.  

Most men cannot resist telling women what to do and how to live their life. Telling a woman what to do before she has emotionally invested is a beta because it subconsciously feels like you are taking responsibility for fixing her life before she deserves it. If you can refrain from giving into your impulse to tell her what to do and trying to “fix” her, you will stand out as different from other men. I have even seen women act surprised when they said something shocking about themselves and I did not act judgmental or preachy. 

Some people might think that worrying about dominance and who is in “charge” in social interactions is over-thinking. I disagree. Women are constantly subconsciously testing your domination and playing power games, and if you are not aware of these games, you will slowly and imperceptibly fall into her frame. Most men have no idea women are playing power games and just comply with womens’ requests to “make her happy,” which ends up relegating them to the beta position in the relationship. 

**Dominance and Shit Tests**

The appear dominant, you must say “no” to her at least once or twice in the interaction. If a woman does not know you, she usually starts with the assumption that you are beta, so you must go out of your way to say no so her subconscious mind knows you give orders and do not take orders. You should say no even if she is not asking you to do anything. You do not need to say “no” in a dramatic or douchey way – in fact, you can say “no” as a joke to something completely silly and unimportant. For example, if the woman says “wow, you are amazing at karaoke, you should go on American Idol!” you can respond “No, definitely not! I need a record deal first.” Even very light, silly nos will solidify the distance of power in your relationship. 

To remain dominant, you do not need to say “no” to every single thing she asks of you. You can, and should, say yes every once in a while. Dominance is a feeling, not a strict rule, and that feeling should be “the guy is generally in charge of this relationship.” In a normal, healthy relationship, both parties sometimes tell each other what to do, and if you say “no” to every single thing she asks you to do her rational mind will make look like an insecure lunatic. 

Before women submit to your dominance, they will often shit test you to determine if your frame is strong. A common power shit test is a power battle, where she will try to give you orders and resist taking your orders. If you obey her orders, you fail. But you must be careful to say “no” in a way that does not make it look like you are petulant child. Remember, this game exists purely on the level of the subconscious – you do not want her to consciously think you are battling her for your position as the alpha. 

When determining whether to comply with a woman’s demands, I use the following rules: 

First, if she asks for something reasonable that she has done something to deserve (i.e., she has followed my commands in the past), then I will just do it for her. For example, if I ask her to hang out and she asks me to pick her up, I will pick her up because I am picking her up to hang out with me. But the moment her demand becomes unreasonable or undeserved, I stop complying. For example, if I have been talking to a woman at a bar for an hour and she asks me to hold her purse while she grabs something out of her purse, I will do it because it would look insane if I announced “I do not hold women’s drinks!! I am the alpha male here!!” But if I am holding her drink and she wanders off to talk to other people, I put her drink down or go give it back to her. Holding her drink for a few seconds while she reaches in her purse is reasonable; holding her drink for 5 minutes while she chats with her friends is not. 

Second, if she asks for something clearly absurd she does not deserve, I either ignore her request, laugh it off, or make fun of her for even asking. For example, if we are waiting in line to get into a concert and she says “pay for my ticket” I will look at her and say “I’m going to forget you even asked that.” Not only do I want to say no, I want to say no in a way that makes her not ask again. Women know when they are being unreasonable. 

Third, if she asks for something reasonable that she does not quite deserve yet, I politely explain to her why I cannot do it. For example, sometimes I meet women and within a few weeks of knowing each other they ask if they can move in with me or go on an overseas vacation with me. I politely answer, “no, I’m sorry I think it is too early.” 

When determining whether to comply with a woman’s request, you must use your common sense and emotional intelligence. If a woman gets hit by a bus and asks you to call the ambulance, you should do so out of a purely moral obligation even if she does not technically “deserve it” from you. If a woman asks you to go get the car for her so she does not have to walk through the snow in high heels, again, you should say yes, even if she does not technically deserve it. You should seem like a normal human being, not a robot obsessed with power. And furthermore, if you are playing the game correctly, you will have built up so many “alpha” points that you can do a few “beta” things and not ruin your frame. 

As I explained earlier, women do not like to lead because leadership requires responsibility and creates anxiety. Nevertheless, women sometimes try to take the lead either because they think they are more competent to lead in a certain environment or because they have not emotionally invested in you enough yet. In these situations, instead of fighting over who is in charge, I follow the woman’s leadership but start to drift off every time the interaction begins to get lame. Once she sees that I am drifting off, the anxiety usually becomes overwhelming for her and she hands the leadership back to me. Sometimes if the adventure fails badly enough, I will just say “ok, I’m not listening to you anymore. I am in charge now.” For example, if we are walking around the city on a date and she is leading the way, if we go down a boring street I will make fun of her and then take the lead back from her. 

Your biggest weapon in a dominance battle is your ability to leave. If she insists on taking the lead and doing things that make the interaction not fun for you, just pretend you have somewhere better to be. That’s all you need to do. You should use your own judgment regarding when and when not to leave, but generally speaking, a good way to determine whether a woman is emotionally invested in you is to look at how much she wants to follow your orders. Women naturally want to let a man take the lead, so if a woman has gotten to know you but still resists your leadership, she has not emotionally invested in you and sees you as either just a friend or somebody she can get things from. 

Saying no to women is hard because you are always taking a chance she will take your “no” badly and leave. This is not a completely irrational fear - some women WILL leave if you do not give them what they want. But think about it – women want to be dominated by a man they find attractive, so if a woman leaves you because you will not do something for her, she likes that thing, not you. And sometimes when you say no a woman will get angry and leave in a huff, and then come back later once she realizes that you are an alpha male who will hold frame and stand his ground.

Sometimes women take your “no” badly and try to argue to make you say yes. A woman might beg, tell you a sob story, insult you (for example, calling you cheap because you will not buy her a drink), explain to you “rationally” why you should cave to their demand (for example, explaining that a gentleman takes a woman to dinner for the first date), or even try to trick you into doing the thing. If a woman keeps pressing you to do something for her, you can politely and firmly tell her why you cannot do it ONE TIME. Afterwards, you should just ignore her and move on. If you sit there and argue with her, you will appear beta because you are fighting for your dominant position. 

Sometimes women are damaged and cannot function in a relationship without being in control. These women have usually been dicked over by dominant men, so they now seek men they can dominate to 1) subconsciously get revenge and abuse the men beneath them and 2) feel safe and like the guy will not leave. When dealing with these women you can try to hold frame and become dominant by using the techniques in this section, but generally speaking, I think these women are usually so broken it is not worth trying to fix them. These women usually spend their lives jumping from beta boyfriend to beta boyfriend, occasionally taking a break to cheat with a dominant guy that treats them like shit, and then going back to the beta boyfriend. 

Whatever you do, you should not cave and let a woman boss you around even if it seems like that is the only way to her heart. No matter how much a woman thinks she wants to dominate, if you let her dominate, she will either lose interest or treat you like shit or both. “Dominant” women usually end up miserable because the thing they thought they wanted does not make them happy.

66,Commitment and consistency against men,114,vkbcpn,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vkbcpn/commitment_and_consistency_against_men/,20,"Men (and people in general) like to maintain consistency in their lives for three reasons:

* It saves time and energy. The most difficult thing to do is to think.
* It is respectable to remain consistent in life.
* It is an easy and sustainable way to navigate through life.

It can be said that men have a higher proclivity to remain consistent since men prefer to remain orderly. Women are more likely to chase excitement. The common dating advice, “you can do anything to a woman but bore her” is the proof of that. On top of it, most cultures all over the world represent men as order and women as chaos. The best example is the “yin and yang” which shows how both order and chaos are representatives of the masculine and the feminine respectively.

In this essay, I have attempted to explain how men’s tendency to remain orderly in their lives is exploited (knowingly or unknowingly) by women and society, in general, to get what they want, even if it means sacrificing the man physically and mentally.

We make a decision, a commitment, and remain consistent with it. But what makes us behave consistently towards a commitment (a decision)? We make a lot of decisions, but not a lot of them evolve to become commitments towards which we are consistent. What makes us commit to a decision consistently?

To understand it in detail, here is a small story of American POWs in communist China during the Korean war (1950-53).

## The essay competitions in China

When American soldiers who were imprisoned in China’s concentration camps returned to their motherland after the war was over, the military officers discovered that their opinions about democracy and communism were very different than what they used to be. Psychologists and researchers dug deep to find out what has transpired during their time in the Chinese prisons.

They found out that in those prisons, the guards (and the administration) held essay competitions where American soldiers had to write praises about the Communist Party of China and/or mock the democratic form of governance in some form way. Of course, most American soldiers resisted, but the fact is they didn’t have to write a lot (in terms of depth) to flatter the administrators to “win” the essay competitions. All they had to do was write things along the lines of “the democratic system is not perfect” and “although Communism appears to have a lot of problems, it does work for the people of China” and so on.

The prize for the winners was nothing extraordinary. It was a pack of cigarettes or a couple of extra hours of yard time. The purpose of it was to ensure that the imprisoned soldiers write the things they write because they believe in them, not because they are motivated by external incentives.

In the subsequent essay competitions, the little truths were elaborated on which the American imprisoned soldiers went the distance and critiqued the American government deeply while citing the great developmental activities completed by the communists for the people of China.

After listening to what has happened in the camps, the researchers and psychologists have found out the parameters that make men behave consistently towards a commitment.

## What the psychologists concluded

There are three things that make us commit to an earlier decision in a consistent way:

1. **Effort**: The decision (the first instance of the activity) should be effortful. In the above example, writing an essay. Although it is not physically demanding, writing requires a lot of mental effort.
2. **Internally motivated**: The prizes offered were mundane. No one in their right mind would betray their hierarchy of values for a pack of cigarettes. It is impossible to make someone naturally comply with something by the application of external force. It has to be internally motivated. In the above example, no one forced those soldiers to write those things, they consciously did it themselves. (Obviously, the Chinese put some form of indirect pressure, but in the minds of imprisoned soldiers, it was internally motivated.)
3. **Public**: The prizes were awarded publicly within the premises of the prison where the winner had to read out their essay. This reinforces the image that they have forged in the eyes of the public. As I mentioned at the beginning, it is respectable to act consistently and even though they were not in prison anymore, they continued to.

Now, you must be getting the idea of how the above tools have been used by the gynocentric society (and the protectors of it) against men.

## Commitment and consistency against men

If you look at the “courting rules” in modern society through the lens of the lesson derived from the story above, it will become evident how women (and society) extract commitment and consistency from men by making the initial and subsequent instances of the courting activity effortful, internally motivated, and public.

Let’s take a look at them one by one. (More examples are welcome.)

### Effortful - bending over backward

Even though the public perception is that “women make the biggest sacrifices”, it is seldom true during the dating phase. The man is expected to dress well, pick up the girl, get to the restaurant early in case the girl is directly coming there, etc. The list is practically endless. Albeit it is true that women like men who are confident and lead well, the material expectation is huge.

Buying her flowers, taking her to a nice restaurant, paying the bill, etc., are all effortful activities that a man is doing. Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying that you shouldn’t do it or cease being a gentleman. I am stating that making the initial instance effortful is part of the reason men are more likely to chase women. It is employed by women and society in general to secure a commitment from the man. 

That is the reason why even in the days of absolute feminism, where women take pride in paying their bills (which they should be doing anyways), men are still expected to put in the extra effort such as picking her up, courting her, etc. It seldom ends and the degree of effort continually increases as more is demanded from the man in the subsequent stages of a relationship, both emotionally, physically, and materially.

### Internally motivated - there is no prize

When you take a girl on a date, you should not expect sex. That is what millions of men are being taught on the regular by the protectors of the gynocentric social order. Even if you are married to the woman, you should not pester her to have sex for a myriad of reasons. The conclusion is you are a horndog and should learn to control yourself.

This leaves one message deep in your subconscious. The only reason you are sacrificing your time with the boys or sleeping in on a Sunday or having your favorite music on the speakers is that you want to. Even though the possibility of the prize could be zero, you are still doing it. More importantly, you are brainwashed to think that you are not doing it for the sex, you are doing it because she is a special person and you like her. 

Society reinforces this by removing accountability for women and forcing men (directly and indirectly) to not have any expectations from a woman, especially those of sexual nature just because she got a free meal out of him.

### Public - post it on the ‘gram

Holding hands in public, going shopping together, revealing to friends and family that you are dating, etc., are all examples of activities that are public-facing. These activities solidify the commitment and rarely fails to secure consistent behavior from the man. The fundamental here is the image of the man is integrated with the woman he is with and hence he will be interpreted as “incomplete and incoherent” if he is without her or behaves in a way that could piss his partner off.

Events such as proposing a woman tick all the boxes above. It is effortful as a man needs to plan the proposal, save money for the ring and the wedding, etc. It is internally motivated that you should not just expect “yes” from a woman and you are proposing because you love her and she is an amazing person. It is public for obvious reasons.

**Note**: There are two more motivators that act as catalysts that coerce men to do things that make them more prone to commit to women. Those two things are shame and praise. The gynocentric society has created a definition of “a good man” and men who fall within that are praised and the rogue ones are shamed. Keep in mind that the definition of “a good man” doesn’t even consider the needs of the man, rather it thrives on their sacrifice. Once they make a man accept that he is “a good man”, they force him to act consistently to maintain that image.

This subreddit has done a great job in writing in-depth guides related to that so I will stop talking about that here.

## Defense against commitment and consistency

As we live in a society where speaking the truth will make you an object of laughter and sneer, it will be difficult not to do anything that could extract commitment out of you towards a woman and make you behave consistently towards her.

However, the solution to the above challenge is already described in various articles in this subreddit. Here are some bullets, feel free to elaborate or provide more tips.

1. Even if you make an effort that is internally motivated and is public-facing, always be ready to walk away and label it as a “bad investment”. You will make mistakes, the worst thing is to hold on to them. Do not water a dead plant.
2. Look at what they are doing. If the investment by the woman is not at least equivalent, if not more, it is more likely that they are not as attached as you. Beware of intangible investments such as, “I think about you all the time” that women use during arguments. They cannot be proven or refuted. They are to be ignored.
3. Restrict your efforts. Be a gentleman, but if a woman is flaky, pull back to the max. There is also no need to take huge leaps in the early stage of a relationship no matter how special you think she is. Women pester for commitment after some time, but that is societal pressure at work. See point 2 and commit only if she is also as invested.

(Keep in mind that the above points are to be used against the compliant tactics discussed in this essay. Other RP points like, “focus on yourself” and “test her character” are useful too, but they are too general in the context of this essay.)

For more details, please read Influence by Dr. Robert Cialdini. (The story of American soldiers is from Chapter 2 of that book. I extrapolated the lessons from it and applied it in the context of dating in the modern age.)

Again, do share examples from your real life if you think it fits the context of this essay and will help others learn about the gynocentric social order.

# Introduction

I haven't gamed girls properly in around 2 years. Things were going fine before the pandemic, but during lockdown, I lost control over my life and went into some great depths of depression, and up until this point, I am still slowly getting back on track. As the city started opening up again, events started happening and such, I am back to meeting girls as regularly as I used to before the pandemic broke out, but one thing I noticed is that I have almost completely forgotten how to have a good conversation with girls. To be fair, I was never good at conversations. When I learnt how to do it properly, it was by reading a lot of posts on this sub. Coming back to this sub trying to find the posts proved to be a painful process, so I started looking more on here and elsewhere and learnt quite a few handy rules and techniques on how to converse with anyone (girls specifically) and I complied them into his post which I hope will help rusty people like me get back on track faster.

Okay, with all of that out of the way, let's jump right into it.

# Fundamentals

By fundamentals, I mean passive skills that you will not be actively doing throughout the interaction with the girl, but they will be in the back of your mind.

**The 90/10 rule**

The person talking is the person investing. You want to do minimal talking that is limited to leading her to talk more about herself. The conversation needs to be 90% about her, 10% about you. This is very critical to build attraction and to make her think that she's known you her entire life.

This is great because it discloses little information about you and it builds suspense and mystery which is what you want to have. Usually by the end of the date, you want to disclose where you're from, what you've studied in the past, what you're currently working/doing, what are your general hobbies and motivation behind them, AND THAT'S IT. But more on this later.

**Positivity**

Positivity can be confused with being overly optimistic and happy, looking more like a joker than a guy who wants to have fun. It is also referred to sometimes as self-amusement. It means that your vibes, the topics of your conversation, your perspectives, your questions, and everything in between have to maintain that ""I am here to have a good time and I shall act as such"". For instance, you won't talk about your work and vent about how shitty your colleagues are. You won't let her talk about her ex boyfriend or stepfather and how much of dicks they were. Avoid venting, negative and instant mood-killing topics.

**Eye contact**

This one has been discussed on here a lot. When you speak with someone, you don't stare directly in their souls and make them feel uncomfortable, neither do you look away all the time and not pay attention to them, you want to look at them straight in the eye when they are talking to you, and when there is nothing to talk about (more on this later) you are allowed to look away. It is just awkward to have someone talking to you and you're looking away like you're not paying attention to them.

With girls, you want to look into for example the left eye, then the right eye, circle down to her mouth while she talks, then look back up to her left eye. You want to keep looking in circles on her face as she is talking. This is a great tip for kino escalation.

**Voice and manners of speaking**

You want to be audible. Not obnoxiously shouting, but you want to be heard. Imagine being a bar with many people around, and you just have to speak a bit louder than usual to make yourself heard: that's how you want to speak, so people can just hear you.

Don't use voice inflections. Inflections is also called uptalk, it's when you come at the end of a statement and you go up and make it sound like a question. This means that you're trying to be nice, don't want to be interrupted or just unsure of what you're saying: don't do that. At the end of every statement, your intonation goes down.

Avoid using words such as ""Oh, Wow! That's so cool! Damn, this is NICE!"" These are feminine words. Supplicating language. You're giving her free validation. We don't do that. Anytime you feel like saying any of that, just say ""Uhm, okay"". And stop there.

**The Vacuum**

Following the previous point, the pace of your speech needs to also be significantly slower, in a way that you create some type of vacuum when you're conversing with the girl.

First of all, you don't want to interrupt her. Remember, this is about her, not you. So when she is talking, GREAT, you keep it going. But when she is done, you don't jump on the cue in a heartbeat. Try counting to 3 first, then say whichever statement/question that you have in mind. This is great because it shows that you're comfortable with being awkward and confident enough that you wouldn't give a fuck if she doesn't talk. You wanna take a sip of your beer? Go for it. She can wait. Your bro texted you a meme? Check it out, chuckle about it.

Girls usually try to fill this vacuum by initiating a conversation that usually starts with, ""Soooooo.... (questions).""

**Body Language**

Don't lean in when speaking with someone. Stand straight. A good exercise is to have your palms facing out while standing up. This will automatically push your chest forward and flex your back to have a straighter posture.

**Assuming Familiarity**

Sometimes, it is really hard to talk with strangers. Being on a date with someone you've met once or twice can be weird, this is why you have to assume that you've known this girl from a social distant social circle and you talk to her like you've just met in a flat party.

**Feminine language and questions**

95% of girls have shit game. Their texts are bland, their topics of conversation are generic, their questions are open-ended, and that's completely fine. After all, they've never really put efforts into learning how to converse because society does that for them (cue in some long monologue about The Blue Pill and a post-feminism western deteriorating society).

The thing is, guys usually have the same mindset and it is taken even further because guys are usually very efficient with their communication. They answer a question precisely, concisely, and fast. This usually leads to some really boring types of conversation that you do not want to have and this is why many dates with girls end up dead because it's like you're in an interview with her, asking her yes/no questions, talking about generic bullshit and using bland and boring language.

What you need to do to use a colorful and emotive language. Think Russel Brand. The guy spits poetry at some point. To men he looks gay, but to girls it's highly seductive. His language and topics are passionate, colorful, dreamy, ambitious, they tap into one's inner feelings and emotions and such. This is what you're going for. But more on this later.

The other thing that you need to do is to avoid ""the Questions of Doom"". These are close-ended generic boring yes/no questions that usually lead the girl to answering and then awkwardly trying to keep the conversation going by saying something random. Where are you from. What you study now. What you work. What's your favorite food. What's your favorite band. More on this later too.

**Section Conclusion**: These are the fundamentals that you need in any context in life (more specifically girls) when having a conversation with somebody just to keep the conversation going and make them feel good being around you. Just learning this is actually enough for you to make significant progress in your conversational quality. If you don't learn these and go on and learn the techniques in the following section, your success will be limited. So I highly encourage you to just get these basics done, read them and re-read them as many times as you can, and try to practice them until they're second nature to you.

# Active Conversational Techniques

These techniques shouldn't be appearing in any particular order. They are things that you can just use whenever you feel like it's the right time.

**Statement followed by a question**

This is how you keep a conversation seamlessly flowing in a natural way. This is also how you ask boring ass open-ended questions but put some spice on them.

When you would like to ask something specific of the person, try to make a statement first that would allude to the information that you're seeking. For example, you want to learn where they're from. Make a statement about their looks, accents, anything that looks remotely related to her culture. When she answers the question, look for clues in her answer and make another statement about it then follow it by a question. It really is that simple.

The statements can be cheeky/funny, or they can still be some bland objective observations about something in particular. I read on here once that using stereotypes helps a lot putting some humor to these statements. For example,

""You sound like you have a British accent. If I were to guess, you're somewhere from the northern parts of the UK?""

""Hahaha, yes, actually I'm from Scotland"".

""This is where guys wear skirts and play music on pipes in the middle of nowhere, right? Do girls get to do the same thing?""

""Hahah, yes, that is exactly the place, I'm from Edinburgh to be more accurate, born and raised there, so we don't really get to do that...blablabla"".

And this just keeps going on... and on... and on. She answers your question. You look for a clue. Make a funny/cheeky statement, ask another question, repeat. This is the barebone of an engaging conversation.

Example statements you can make:

* You look like you’ve just been (insert what she looks like she's been doing \[jogging, business meeting, studying\])
* You look very (insert adjective) because (insert observation) \[You look fit because of how good your posture is. Do you lift?\].

**Open Questions**

Statements followed by a question is a rule that can be broken whenever you feel like it. You are of course allowed to ask questions, but these have to be open questions. The kind of questions they ask you to write essays about. I think this is self-explanatory so I will just give you some example of great open questions you can use:

* What is it about (insert a clue) that you love?
* What was it like growing up in…?
* What’s the story with (insert a clue)?
* How did (insert a clue) make you feel?

**Stealth Questions**

These are questions wrapped in statements. You are making a statement that pushes her to answer a question that the statement arises. It's very stealthy and unnoticeable. For example, you can start a statement by saying, ""I don't know about you, but I think NYC in summer time is the best because people can go out, sunbathe and have fun"". 9 times out of 10 she will try to either argue otherwise or agree and add more context.

You can also compare and contrast something. She says for example that she likes skiing. You can say, ""Skiing is very similar to skateboarding because you're still gliding on some form of surface"". (ok that was such a stupid thing to say, but the point is to get them talking about their hobbies).

**Parroting**

This has got to be my favorite tool in all of this. Parroting is when you take the last few words they said and reformulate them. You're not asking anything, you're not making a statement. You're just repeating what they say as in you're saying, ""So you were saying... (insert the last few words that they said).

Example:

Her, ""I moved to Europe because of business and now I've been working as a model and it's going great!""

You, ""So you've been working as a model"".

Her, ""Yes, I've met this photographer...blabla"".

You, ""You also mentioned business"". (this is a bit extreme. I would most likely follow that by a statement).

Her, ""I'm working with consultancy firm where I'm from blabalba"".

# Content of the Conversation

**Conversation Topics**

Okay, you got the basics and techniques down. What to talk about now? Surprisingly, this is the easiest sections. To find shit to talk about, this is the best and laziest way to do so:

1. Past
2. Present
3. Future

You talk about her **past**:

* What was it like growing up in...?
* You said you’re working in IT, but what did you want to do that when you were a kid?

Tap in her past. Ask her about what happened before she moved in your city, what was it like doing this or that, open questions, statements about her past..etc.

When you run out of things to say, ask her what she's up to now, the **present**, what's going on her with life, now.

* What she’s/was doing today
* How she settled in (city)
* Are you going somewhere later?
* What activities she's up to during the week
* How her week looks like now

When you run out of topics for that, you talk about the **future**

* What her plans will be in the future
* Does she want to do what she's doing for the rest of her life
* How many kids she want to have
* Any plans to go back to uni... etc

Another very easy topics to talk about are her travels, hobbies, and passions.

**Environmental Pressure flip**

For this one, you have to use the environment to your advantage. When you practically have nothing to talk about, look around and make a statement about something you think is remotely interesting. There are a few games you can even play with her like who you would fuck, marry and kill out of the guys in the room. Or there are places that you can take her that are environmentally rich, such as the zoo, the museum, the river and such. Almost there is always something to talk about in these places and you shouldn't run out of things to say.

Another thing is to instead of being one-on-one date, you create a social bubble of ""we"". We are observing the environment we are in, we are making statements about what's going on around here, not just you and her as separate entities.

It is also interesting to make some future plans in a cheeky and playful banter. Tell her that one day you will take her to Vegas to marry her when the topic of marriage comes up. Or tell her that you know this great bar with great view on the River Thames you want to show her next time. You're not committing to this, you're letting her know that this isn't only a one-time thing and that you might linger just a little bit more.

**Your 10%**

As I mentioned above, girls have no game. At least in my experience. She will ask you about your hobbies, about your studies and work, and about some other generic bullshit boring questions.

Now, instead of answering this like a man, you want to play a game. She asks you where you're from. You tell her she has three questions to ask and three guesses and if she guesses it right she will get a cookie.

Or you just start describing where you're from and tell her to guess as you're doing it. Eventually you'll tell her, sure, but it's more interesting when you describe it.

Put a twist on your job title. Make it sound more interesting or more adventurous than it really is. If you work in sales, tell her you manipulate people into buying products for much more expensive prices than their worth, and these products are actually drugs you test before you sell...etc. Don't forget to use emotive and colorful language when talking about your hobbies.

Hobbies specifically have two layers to them. What you do literally and the motivation behind doing it. You want to always find some form of passion or interesting thing as to why you like doing what you do.

For example,

* I like doing portrait photography because I get to capture the subtleties in peoples' appearance and it's really interesting to capture people's different vibes and personalities. Some you can feel are depressed/shy by nature, others more confident and dominant... etc.
* Or let's say you like skydiving, water surfing and bungee jumping. Life is too short to sit at home and take no risks. You love adventure and you live for it.

This usually builds deep rapport and makes you look like you've connected to her on a deeper more meaningful level. This is also a perfect opportunity to open up and do your due diligent 10% of the conversation and call it a day. Usually after this, I'd try to answer as less questions from her part as possible.

# Let Her Know That You're Here to Fuck

All of what I've described above is great stuff to keep a great and engaging conversation going. However, it can easily drop you in the friendzone territory real fast, especially if you overdo it, so this is why even though you're a good and genuine listener, you still want to fuck and you let her know.

**Sexual Escalation**

People nowadays are very self-conscious about touching, so you have to proceed cautiously. I found that the best way to build sexual attraction with girls is to touch them *when justified* or as it was referred on this sub ""high points"".

High points is when something of substance occurs on this conversation. For example when she makes a joke or tells you a funny story, you tap her on the shoulder and let her know that that was hilarious. If she tells you she works out often and such, you check her biceps and tell her that they're alright. Or if you're trying to gauge her height, you pat her on the head and tell her how tiny she seems. When you are walking around and you want her to take a left, you wrap your arm around her to lead her. When you tell her that she looks younger than she is and compliment how healthy her skin looks (u caress the face) and fresh her hair seems (roll her hair on your fingers). This, and much more.

You want touching to be a normal thing during the conversation and you want it to follow the topics of the conversation. Don't sit across from her, sit next to her, keep the physical proximity to a minimum. Don't touch her somewhere inappropriate. Just have a regular banter and touch her when you want to. This will build sexual tension which usually leads to you kissing her.

**Don't be a nice and agreeable guy**

Being a genuine and thoughtful guy is a good thing, don't get me wrong. But in this context, you don't want be that guy through and through. You want to challenge her at least twice on two separate opinions. You agree and like what she is talking about most of the time, but then she trash talks your favorite show or band or when she compliments something you wholeheartedly abhor, you let her know that you disagree with what she says because of this and that, all with a smile on your face as to not come off as aggressive. This usually takes her aback and she learns that this guy although respectful and agreeable, he's not afraid to show his teeth and attack at a moment's notice.

**Make your Intentions Clear**

This is very hard for most people, even for me. You have to make your intentions clear that this conversation is me flirting with you because I find you attractive and cute and want to have some sort of a sexual rapport/relationship. You do this by throwing in a nonchalant compliment about something that she says. For example, you can tell her that you can't make what color her eye is and you find them captivating. Or you can tell her to smile again because it looks like a Hollywood type of smile. You can comment on how fit she looks and that you straight up like her curves. You let her know that you just find here attractive.

**Make her qualify herself to you**

When she makes a controversial statement, you ask her to justify yourself or to explain something more. This will make her automatically seek your validation and approval and puts her in a supplicating type of position which builds attraction without even knowing it.

Also make statements saying that you wouldn't for instance date girls who study art/computer science/economics..etc but she looks not like the other girls and you'd give her a pass.

# Conclusion

Well, there you have it, folks. I hope this will be of help to some of you coming back to game after a few years of being off, and I hope people will find the content of this article useful into honing their skills and becoming a more sociable and a guy people can talk to easier and be around more.

EDIT: corrected a lot of grammar mistakes, and just wanted to say that even though I think this will help the community greatly, it is also good for me to have everything I learnt in one place to revisit for the future.",1656069756.0
68,Relevancy and Learning Game,12,vjq8fm,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vjq8fm/relevancy_and_learning_game/,4,"[All men by nature desire to know.](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.1.i.html) When it comes to questioning on the ""meaning"" of things, as you should do, it is better to consider their ""relevance"". Relevance is a practical notion of meaning particular to you. The more crucial aspect of learning game is to know very well why **you** are learning game, going out, and trying to get laid. What is your true motivation? Idealism (metaphysical meaning) is great and all as point to strive towards, but it may simply not be exactly relevant to you at your point in life and thus not a sufficient motivation. Without satisfactory motivation or purpose, your activity will be hopeless.

How can you apply this? Sit down and think, for as long as it takes, why you want to get laid until you feel you have reached a satisfying understanding of **your** purpose.

One thing among many for me is that I've realized that I had a sort of ""self hate"" for not having a voracious sex drive, ""pit bull tenacity"", and being unable to freely express my sexual desire. I've always felt myself different from others in this way and being less than for it. The daily stress of this lack would drive me to damn near suicide if I was unable to figure this shit out. Regardless of the truth of the matter with respect to how other people actually experience their sex drive and so on, this notion of myself was extremely relevant and in connecting with it by being honest with myself, I found the proper congruent motivation for carrying an interaction all the way to sex in spite of very basic fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

We are drawn towards pleasure or away from pain. When you are in your head by default, stifled, neurotic as most people are, **the escape from pain is the far more relevant motivation**, as unideal and un-[Pook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaklRDhNkZY)ish as that may be. I knew full well that if I was unable to express my sexual desire, my life would be an endless cycle of pain. I could go on about the catastrophic scenario painted in my mind but I'll save that for my hard drive. The point is that this motivation was relevant to my mental state and my self-concept and my history and so on and without that sufficient relevant congruence, I would have never pushed beyond my comfort zone.

[""The unexamined life is not worth living,"" spoke Socrates.](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/apology.html) ""Know thyself"" is written at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Be shameless in sitting down, spending the time to introspect, and being honest with yourself about who have grown up to be, and what it is that you want and more importantly **do not want**. Write it all out. You will know when you have struck gold because you will get up, go outside, and make it happen. The information you need will make itself apparent to you. It will simply make plain sense to you because it will have become completely relevant and resonant with you.

Your truth shall set you free.",1656082286.0
69,The most hyper feminist women I've ever slept with are the ones that enjoy being degraded and humiliated the most.,551,vgzm3c,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vgzm3c/the_most_hyper_feminist_women_ive_ever_slept_with/,129,"A couple years ago I slept with two VERY feminist women a few months apart. Their rants about men and the patriarchy outside of the bedroom were legendary, but once they started getting turned on, they wanted me to do things to them that no other women has ever wanted me to do. Some of it was so degrading that I actually refused to do it. Now, if you're kinky that's fine, but it's not typically my thing (dominance is plenty for me), and while I'm all for a little exploration here and there, I'm (personally) not interested in violently face fucking a tied up chick while she chokes and gags on my cock... and I was kinda caught off guard (at the time), to find out that they both wanted... very rough treatment both physically \*and\* psychologically, from me. **Their sexual requests from a man were the antithesis of everything they had been saying about men all day.** (I basically ignored their requests, did what I wanted, and was done with it.)

I suspect there's a major psychological compensation at play here for these women who have been brainwashed with the modern narrative. They want to be submissive so badly that all that suppressed energy comes out as soon as they start getting aroused. They truly have no clue what they really want and usually have the highest levels of depression and anxiety you can find in their gender. This could be (sexually) capitalized on in another time period, but in the modern world, fucking these women is like playing with fire for self-evident reasons. Needless to say it wasn't very long after that that I decided to no longer pursue outspoken feminists, regardless of how hot they were. There are tens of millions of other women out there one can pursue without playing Russian Roulette with a bitch who spews vitriol about men outside of the bedroom, and then wants vitriol spewed on her BY men once the clothes come off.",1655769623.0
70,Why Self Improvement?,156,vghle4,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vghle4/why_self_improvement/,31,"To any man reading this, I'm sure you're all familiar with the advice to ""just be yourself"" when it comes to interacting with women. And while there's some truth to that, the fact is that women are attracted to confident, successful men. So if you're not working on improving yourself, you're not going to be as successful with women as you could be.  

When it comes to dating and relationships, it's important for you to focus on improving themselves instead of impressing women. After all, you can't have a healthy and lasting relationship if you're not taking care of yourself first.  There are a number of ways you can work on improving themselves, both physically and mentally. 

Here are a few areas you should focus on:  

 1. Physical fitness. Women are attracted to men who are in good shape. Hit the gym and get in shape. Not only will you look better, but you'll also feel better and have more energy.  

2. Your career. Women are attracted to men who are successful in their careers. If you're not happy with your current job, start working towards a promotion or finding a new job that you're passionate about.  

3. Your hobbies and interests. Women are attracted to men who have hobbies and interests that they're passionate about. Find something you're passionate about and start pursuing it.  

4. Your social life. Women are attracted to men who have an active social life. Make an effort to get out there and meet new people. Join clubs, attend social events, and just generally put yourself out there.  

5. Your sense of style. Women are attracted to men who take pride in their appearance and have a good sense of style. If you don't have much fashion sense, start by doing some research and then slowly start incorporating better style into your life. 

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what areas you want to focus on improving. But remember, the goal should be to make yourself the best you can be, not just to impress women. If you're happy and confident in yourself, that's what will ultimately attract the right partner into your life. Here are a few ways that you can work on improving yourself:  

1. Set goals and work towards them.  It's important to have something to strive for in life. Otherwise, you'll just end up feeling aimless and lost. Figure out what you want to achieve, and then put in the hard work to make it happen.  

2. Be confident.  Confidence is key in any area of life. If you're not confident in yourself, it'll be difficult to achieve anything. Start working on building up your self-esteem, and you'll see everything else start to fall into place.  

3. Be independent.  Don't rely on anyone else to make you happy. Learn to be content with your own company, and you'll find that you're much happier and more fulfilled. 

 4. Be honest.  With yourself and with others. Honesty is the cornerstone of any good relationship. If you can't be honest with yourself, you'll never be able to be honest with anyone else.  

5. Challenge yourself.  Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. It's only by pushing yourself that you'll grow and learn. 

Embrace new challenges and see them as an opportunity to learn and grow.  These are just a few ideas to get you started. Improving yourself is a journey, not a destination. So start today, and see where it takes you.",1655717870.0
71,Women Use Love To Soften Men Up,243,vg1wda,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vg1wda/women_use_love_to_soften_men_up/,66,"Too many men have met their demise in the name of love.  From suicide to getting killed to going to prison, men have been softened up because they fell in love with a woman.

A man should not fall in love, but he should be loving to his women.

Fall in love: Your emotions take over when you love a woman

Be loving: treat the woman in the manner of a man who loves a woman without letting his emotions take over.

I remember listening to an old Alan Roger Currie Blogtalk podcast where he said (and I paraphrase) that women will throw the word ""love"" out to any man, but be more selective with the men they sleep with, whereas men will be selective to tell a woman they love them, but have sex with any woman.  In my opinion, women will use ""love"" to soften a man up.  When a man loves a woman, he's more generous, more protective, and more hesitant to take actions needed (like punish bad behavior).

There are women who manipulate men with love.  This is why it's very important that you value cooperation over love.  You could fall in love with an unruly bitch and she has you wrapped around her finger.  This woman could break things off with you and your life would be over.  When a woman is cooperative and values you, she doesn't need to tell you she loves you... she shows it with her actions.  Value her submission than her telling you she loves you.

Women love bomb men to get what they want.  This means a committed relationship, a marriage, and a family.  If you dissect many relationships, the man and the woman in the relationship should have never went past fuck buddy status.

The thing is, these women are getting their “beta bucks” needs met through their clients aren’t they?  So when it comes to their LTR’s are they with alpha men or are they still with beta bucks there too? 

Would alpha men actually be okay with being in a LTR or having a kid with a stripper or escort. 
Theres one single mom stripper for instance who had a kid with her second babydaddy

What does TRP say about fucking escorts or strippers for cash in general?  It seems like it could be considered beta bucks, yet at the same time there seem to be a lot of nba players, actors celebrities etc who are fucking pornstars or high level instagram model escorts.

Usually, you’d have to pay $1000+ an hour to bang a famous pornstar or instagram model.  Do these celebrity guys do it in order to save time and avoid drama with women? Cause they could technically go anywhere in public and have thousands of hot girls willing to fuck them for free. Girls who’d likely be just as hot or hotter than the escorts or pornstars. 

There are older men doing this strategy, picking up waitresses, college girls at bars, and strippers and escorts and giving them cash to fuck. Usually $200+ for an hour up to $1000 for famous ig models or pornstars.",1655675028.0

We hooked up on the first night and started seeing each other off and on for a while. No exaggeration, we had almost everything in common: our musical tastes, the food we liked, our (dark) sense of humor... everything. (It was actually borderline absurd how many parallels there were.) Now a blue-pilled mind might start thinking, ""soulmate."" I was however at a point in my life (still am), where I was not interested in pairing off, for various reasons, no matter how uncanny our relationship kept becoming, I refused to commit. I even let her know from the very beginning I'd be ending this at some point. We were just having fun, no big deal. It got to the point that despite the fact we didn't have an exclusive relationship, we were acting like a swinging monogamous couple, minus any titles. (I never ONCE allowed her to call me her boyfriend and I never once called her my girlfriend.) To be honest, I've never me a woman before or after that could \*play\* with me the way she could. Our playtime, not just in the bedroom, was awesome. If I had been of a monogamous mindset, I might have tried to choose her to pair-bond back then. It was only my cultivated mindset that kept me away from commitment.

This pseudo-relationship went on for years, honestly. We'd bang someone else and then come back to each other and talk about how insane most men and women are. I thought our relationship would end sooner than it actually did, but I wound up staying in Colorado longer than I expected, so we spent 4 years seeing each other... and she fell MADLY in love with me. I grew very, very fond of her, too, but she told me she would have stayed with me for life, and she couldn't help herself. She knew I wasn't hers, and that just made her want me even more.

At that time, I truly did feel bad for what I considered was ""leading her on"" but the truth is I was always honest with her. ""I like you. You're fun. I like the way I feel when you're around. But I'll be leaving someday. I know we're not the right one for each other for life."" However I NOW see that I was working crazy dread-game on her without even realizing it. By placing her in an impossible situation where she could never have my heart permanently, (I told her it was elsewhere), she must have internalized my value as a mate being off the charts, and couldn't help herself. I always gave her the choice to leave, and she never did. This created a spiral of me liking her more and more even though I still knew I'd end it someday, and she responded to this incredibly well as far as her feelings for me went as she was constantly experiencing a plethora of both positive and negative emotions about our relationship without being able to blame me for any mistakes I made.

I also remember really internalizing red-pill only months before our relationship ended and changing the way I approached sex with her, acting like I was entitled to it and she didn't really much of a say about it.

I've never seen her more wet in my life. Fucked with my mind hard, but it is what it is.

I honestly had no intention to create dread game, I just didn't care. I was just being honest about where I was. It is actually quite disturbing to me, in retrospect, to realize that I had allowed my self to fall head over heels with her and give my heart to her fully, she may not have fallen for me the way she did at all.",1655504426.0

About 6'4"", solid build, high earner ($200K+), confident, loyal and all all around genuinely nice guy. The ""every woman's dream"" type of guy you'd think. Even his family (her in-laws) were the model in-laws who adored her and were very generous to her. 

A year into their marriage, she started interviewing for a career change and fell hard for her future boss, we'll call him Chad, at the very first interview. They had lots of chemistry and to her, ""there was no stopping"" what would eventually happen. Over the next 2 years she regularly cheated on her loyal husband with Chad. When she met Chad, he was in a LTR with a woman who he was known to regularly cheat on. When they eventually got caught, he broke it off fairly easily with his LTR (no kids, no marriage) and she turned her life upside down for Chad by divorcing her wonderful husband and splitting up their assets. 

She and Chad moved in together and Chad never made any promises of commitment, never publicly announced their relationship on social media, and invested himself into work. She also knew about his history of cheating prior to them getting together, but she continued on anyways because of tingles and feels and how what SHE felt was REAL love. 

Now, 4 years later, the relationship has inevitably grown stale for him and he's completely withdrawn. He's almost certainly fucking other women but she sadly ""believes him when he says he's not."" She's 40 years old. He's in his prime, even more-so than when they started seeing one another. And she is full of rage for ""turning her life upside down for him"" and her ex husband is remarried to a young blonde with kids on the way. Since this woman is a close friend, it hurts to watch her go through this. But she blames things on him - ""he's taken everything from me"", ""he's so selfish"" and it's tough for me to have sympathy for her. They're still living together and she continues to cook him meals and do his laundry, hoping that the feelings will return because she is convinced he is the one and true love of her life.

I grew tired of gaming chicks, tired of putting on the show. Quit thinking about the game to focus on things I cared about, things not involving girls. I figured since I had shed my insecurities and nice guy tendencies I could just live my fun life, quit playing games, and still get some girls here and there, being my authentic self.

Nope. Now they ghost, flake, or offer to be friends, lol. I'm kinda torn here, I could go back to doing what has worked, but I'm not really feeling that, being cocky and mysterious isn't really me. I could just be my new and improved confident self, and accept the fact I will get less women, and the ones that do work out would probably be a better fit for me.

Age: 28

Race: Eastern Asian

Height: 5'7

Location: Las Vegas  


**Preface:** This field reports gonna contain alot of adventures. From stealing a girl from her sugar daddy, to making out with her best friend, to trying to do a threesome, to nuking my own set because I went for the high risk play.   


It was another weekend of raging. Lately, I feel like I've just been partying more than running game but that's only because my wings keep having guests in town. My roommate M had some friends in town so I went out with them. They got a table at the club and I was pulling girls to the table. My roommate M pulled these two white girls to the table, let's call them Ashley and Jessica. Both were 21yos and quite hot. Ashley was hotter. Like a 8/10 with a banging body.   


**Set:**  
1. I came back to the table after bringing some girls back and I see Ashley and Jessica sitting at the booth so I sat next to Ashley and opened with a push pull statement. The set immediately hooks. We chat for like 30 seconds and I'm physically escalating on her simultaneously. I calibrated that she was down based on how well the physical escalation was going and go in for the make out. We're now intensely making out within 60 seconds. Turns out she has a huge thing for asian guys.   


Her bestfriend, Jessica, was sitting right next to her and I was like shit I need someone to wing me. So I tried to ""whisper"" to other guys at the table to wing me on her friend. Essentially, none of them were able to wing me but it wasn't their fault. Turns out, Jessica has a thing for black guys and there weren't any black guys around. So I redirected my focus on Ashley. We're making out even more. She proceeds to straddle me and things are getting pretty inappropriate. Like imagine a packed table of people just talking to each other and then in the middle, there's this girl straddling a guy and making out intensely lmao.   


Anyways, I'm like okay it's time to pull. I tell Ashely let's go grab a drink somewhere else less loud. She agrees. I pulled her out of the table. Her friend Jessica comes with us. I'm like fuck. How the fuck am I gonna manage this? But it's whatever, there's a 0% chance of us having sex at the club. At least if I pulled both girls back to my place, there might be a 5% chance.   


I take the girls outside of the club and this is where I find out Jessica has a thing for black dudes so I'm HUNTING. I tried to introduce her to two different black guys but it didn't work out and I'm like whatever I can't deal with this right now, I got to focus on Ashley. All 3 of us sat down at the slot machines and this is where God gave me a freebie. Jessica said she has to go to the restroom so she went. We waited for her for like 15 minutes and she wasn't coming back. Ashley tried calling and texting multiple times. Nothing. So Ashley was like ""fuck it, let's just go, she probably met some dude"". Im like SWEET. fuck yeah lets bounce.   


I take her back to my place and yall know how it goes ;) So afterwards, we were chatting a bit more and it turns out she's here with her sugar daddy LOL. I did not fucking know. Nor would I have gave a fuck lmao. Apparently he funded the trip and he was at the club too. Anyways, the next day, I dropped her off because he had a pool party to go to.   


After her pool party, she calls me to pick her up and I'm like ok. I pick her up and she's with Jessica and I'm like okay wtf is this. I have another night of turning up so I'm not really trying to hang out, I wanted to take a nap if anything. I brought them to my place so now I'm thinking.... ""ok are we about to have a threesome, and if so how do I play this?"" lmao. Ashley was tipsy and clearly down to fuck. Jessica went to the balcony to smoke a joint. I'm making out with Ashley and getting pretty sexual so I bring her to my room. I could have just fucked her there but... I wanted to try to do a threesome. So I told Ashley, I'mma check up on Jessica.   


I left the room and went to the balcony. I'm now chatting and flirting with Jessica. I escalate verbally but just asking her if she's ever had sex on a balcony before. Eventually, we go back into the living room and I did hand of god and pulled her closer to me. Now we're making out. We're getting pretty sexual. I'm fingering her and such. Then she's asks me something along the lines of ""uhh what about Ashley?"". Tbh, idk what I responded with. Jessica proceeds to go into my room and lays on the bed with Ashley whos sleeping by now. Jessica said she's tired and she's gonna take a nap too. And that was it lmao. Sorry boys, very anti climatic. The threesome did not happen.   


They napped for like an hour and then I dropped them off at their hotel. A few hours later, I get a call from Ashley and she asked ""so did you try to fuck my friend?"". LOL. I was like.... uhhhhh........... yes. And this is how I nuked my own set.   


**Key Take Aways:** 

1. Game > Money: I think this set was an excellent example that money BY ITSELF is not enough to attract women. Don't get me wrong. I'm not advocating for yall to be broke. But if you're using money to attract women, you'll always lose to guys who can genuinely attract women. 
2. If you cant pull her by herself, then pull everybody: I couldn't pull Ashley by herself but does that mean I just give up on the set? Fuck no. This happens all the time. Girls cant get separate blah blah blah. The point is, there's a 0% chance of you sleeping with her at the club/bar/mall/whatever, so pull the whole group and maybe you'll have a 5% chance at your place. 
3. Quit your self limiting beliefs: I would have never hooked up with Ashley if I had self limiting beliefs such as white girls aren't into asian guys. Or I'm not tall enough to hit on her. Etc. 
4. Risk it for the biscuit: Stop playing life so safe. Fortune favors the bold and you need to take risk. Either that's asking your classmate out on a date or trying to bang her best friend in hopes of it turning into a threesome. Like what was I suppose to do? I had to go for the threesome lmao. It didn't work out and completely nuked my set but whatever. Live and learn gents.",1655218784.0

Can you actually explain it? 

“Why yes sir, her nose is approximately 5 centimeters left of her eyes which protrude at an even level not more than 3 inches a part, producing a beautiful face which makes me want to stick my meat pole inside it.”

Or maybe you are not as sophisticated

“She got big titties man, and a nice ass. She fine.” 

When you see a girl you’re attracted to, you just are. No dude is out here rationalizing why he is attracted to a girl the same way no girl is rationalizing why she is attracted to a dude. 

The advice “don’t ask a girl how to get girls” is often frowned upon in places not like the red-pill. It’s misogynistic, sexist, blah blah blah. 

“Are you saying a girl can’t give good advice?”

No. They just don’t give good advice on what makes men attractive to them. They don’t know why. They just are. 

What makes a man attractive and a woman attractive obviously differ. A woman for her beauty, attitude, and certain “household” skills and a man for what he can do for/to the girl. 

If a girl asked you what she could do to be more attractive to a man and her face looked like it was ran over by a semi-truck, what would you say? 

Maybe go to the gym and build a nice body, but that’s pretty obvious. If you were on the street and you saw the woman in question, you would look at her and think nothing of her sexually, because you’re not attracted to her. 

You don’t know why, ok maybe you do, she’s ugly. But you don’t know *why* her being “ugly” isn’t attractive to you. You can probably look inward and think about it. “Her nose is too far away from her eyes” or “she’s too skinny.” 

But in your day to day, as you see women (if you see women) you aren’t thinking about the curvature of her face or how the alignment of her eyes makes it look like she’s from the goonies, which turns you off. You simply aren’t attracted. Next girl please.

Girls aren’t thinking about this doubly so because of their dependency on their feelings and they don’t think rationally a lot of the time.

This is why you can’t take advice from women on how to get women the same way women can’t take advice from men to make them more initially desirable to men, neither party will be able to explain it without getting weirdly technical. 

A girl isn’t going to tell a man that she wants a man who cannot be controlled, who can physically and mentally dominate her. She might not even know she wants that or why (they usually don’t). She’s going to say something like “he needs to be confident, nice, patient, and have a good personality” because it’s what she thinks she wants. 

The same way a man isn’t going to tell a girl, “I want a girl whose eyes are 15 centimeters from the base of her head with her legs congruent to her hip ratio in an hourglass fashion, firm c cups and luscious lips, get plastic surgery.” Most of us just want them to be hawt, at least for the first fuck. We don’t give a shit how it happens, make it happen bitches!

Obviously relationships are a different story, but as for what makes us initially attracted to women, we’re as clueless as women are about men. 

Don’t ask guys for advice on how to be pretty. Don’t ask girls for advice on how to be a man.

In some myths he has an emotional or mental battle with the woman, sometimes he has sex with her, and sometimes he does both. As a result of the encounter the man becomes civilized, leaves his animalistic, childlike ways behind, and begins to focus on improving himself by seeking knowledge, collecting resources by working, and conquering other men. Examples of these myths include the Epic of Gilgamesh and the story of Adam and Eve in the Bible. 

In the Epic of Gilgamesh, which is the oldest serious literature known to humankind, the people of Uruk beg the gods to save them from their king, Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh is Chad, the perfect, archetypal alpha male. Being 2/3 god himself, he exhausts and defeats all other men in games and has sex with all the beautiful women in the land. In fact, Gilgamesh particularly likes to fuck women before their husband the night of their wedding. Nobody can defeat him, and all obey and live in fear of him. 

To save the people of Uruk, the gods create an exact copy of Gilgamesh named Enkidu to defeat and kill Gilgamesh. But Enkidu has no desire to fight Gilgamesh. In fact, Enkidu has no desire for the trappings of civilization of like money, glory, or even good food. Enkidu even runs away with the other animals when he sees a human, even though he was built to be as powerful and intimidating as Gilgamesh. 

To force Enkidu to live up to his potential and focus on his mission of defeating Gilgamesh, the gods send Enkidu a prostitute named Shamhat, who has wild, crazy sex with Enkidu for a week. After this week of passion, Enkidu falls in love with Shamhat and agrees to go the city with her, where she civilizes him by making him dress, eat, and act like a human. More importantly, Shamhat convinces Enkidu to go fight Gilgamesh by telling him she would rather fuck Gilgamesh. Like a good white knight beta male, Enkidu goes to stop Gilgamesh from fucking a woman the night of her wedding. Enkidu loses the battle, but he and Gilgamesh become friends and travel the world defeating monsters for fame.  

The gods then decide to kill Enkidu. Upon learning that he will die, Enkidu starts crying like a little bitch. He regrets the encounter with Shamhat, curses her, and wishes that could have stayed an animalistic child in the wilderness. But the gods tell Enkidu that encountering the prostitute was necessary for his development as a man. He takes back all the mean things he said about her. 

The crazy thing about the Epic of Gilgamesh is that Enkidu is literally Chad. He was created as an exact copy of the perfect, archetypal alpha male. But it was only after he got some pussy that he wanted to seek status, conquer men, and become a hero. But the encounter with the woman also domesticated him, civilized him, sapped him of his vigor, which made him fail in his mission of defeating Gilgamesh. There was no reason for Enkidu to lose to Gilgamesh other than his own mind. The challenge, therefore, is to use women for motivation, but not to be trapped by them. 

Why do may cultures have a myth where a man becomes civilized after encountering a woman? What are these myths trying to teach? Maybe they are trying to teach that men are by nature free-spirited and desire to wander the unknown; and that women are constantly trying to domesticate, feminize, and control men. Maybe these myths are trying to teach that women are man’s greatest challenge and desire, so mens’ primary motivation in self-improvement is to impress women. Or maybe these myths are trying to teach that men can only live peacefully in society after they learn empathy, compassion, and self-control from dealing with women. Whatever the lesson, the basic message is the same: a man is not a man until he struggles with a woman.

Unfortunately in modern society most men are failing in their encounters with women. Statistics show that fewer men are having sex and every few weeks an “incel” does a mass shooting somewhere. An army of weird nerds now live on the internet all day, crying about how terrible women are and how unfair the world is, and whining about the fact they are not Chad. Like Enkidu, they regret encountering women and wish to retreat back to a childlike state where they can just play video games, watch internet porn, and curse women like Enkidu cursed Shamhat. Like Enkidu, these men had the potential to be Chad and defeat the alpha male, but they lost one battle and gave up. 

But the myths make one thing very clear: once you leave the childlike state, you can not easily return. God puts a flaming sword at the entrance of the Garden of Eden, and the Sumerian gods make clear to Enkidu he can not go back to living with the animals. Nor do the gods want you to go back: the gods created you to be a world conqueror who gathers knowledge, builds civilizations, and has relationships with women. In fact, the whole reason the gods arranges the encounter with the woman was to strengthen you for your mission as a world conqueror.  

At the same time, the myths include another important message: a man can and should return to this free-spirited, childlike state, not by retreating from women and civilization, but rather by conquering and overcoming it. Women are most attracted to men in the free-spirited, wild state, but womens’ desire to control, domesticate, and “shit test” men destroys the very thing women liked about men in the first place. And while in every myth the man fails the test the first time, he can still be redeemed later. After the destruction of Zion, the Bible talks about how God will restore it to be better than the Garden of Eden. And in the Epic of Gilgamesh, after the death of Enkidu Gilgamesh honors his fallen friend by going into the wilderness and living with the animals again – but this time, not as a naïve child, but as the alpha male. 

A few years ago, an anonymous poster on the internet message board SoSuave.com named Pook made a bunch of posts about how the best way to build attraction with women is to return to your childlike state, back before you first encountered women. Quoting another poster named Anti-Dump, he said “You should be free as a bird, flapping around, singing, full of joy with life. Women want to catch the bird and throw it in a cage.” But, Pook points, out “who wants a bird that WANTS to be in the cage? No, women want the birds that are FREE, WILD, and BEAUTIFUL. They want A GOOD CATCH. Good Catches do not fly into cages. Only wounded or needy birds do.”  

You must therefore succeed in your encounters with women by returning to that original state where you were free as a bird, singing, and full of joy and life.

80,Trust The Numbers Game,99,vb8erh,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vb8erh/trust_the_numbers_game/,68,"From some of the comments I get, there are a bunch of non-believers that the number game will work for them.  Some will say that they've approached hundreds of women and still  no luck.  Unless you track it, you are only guessing.

When you first cold approach women, you will get rejected a lot because you're new to it and radiate a lot of nervous energy.  You will approach women who have boyfriends/husbands.  You will approach women who may have funky attitudes (fortunately, most women aren't rude and disrespectful when you yourself are respectful to them).  The numbers game is all about sifting through the women who are not available, non-cooperative, or just flat out wrong for you, to get to the women who are compatible and highly cooperative to you.

A good way to stick it out playing the numbers game is this:

The first 7-10 approaches will get you comfortable approaching women.  You will notice that you're not feeling as nervous as you did approaching the first woman.  From this point on, you will notice that you're pushing your comfort zones when interacting with women.

Treat each interaction like practice.  The goal is to feel within your element approaching women.  You will notice that by adopting this mindset, you're getting bolder, more solid, and more confident with women.

You will have a moment where you're shopping and you spot a sexy woman with an amazing body.  You approach her without hesitation (cold approaching a lot of women trains your brain to behave in this manner).  You talk to her and ask her for her number.  She gives it to you, you call her, and it's not a fake number.  You set a date, but the girl flakes.

Don't worry about situations like these.  This just means you're getting close to your goal.  You will start to notice that you're getting more numbers than you have previously.  Trust the numbers game.

One day you might have to get an oil change.  A cute chick with a nice pair of legs needs to get an oil change too.  You talk to her for the duration of the oil change.  Before the both of you leave, you exchange numbers.  You set a date, she accepts and arrives, and the both of you have sex at some point.  It may not be the first day, but possibly the second or third in-person interaction.

For some men, it may take 20 approaches to get laid.  For some men, it may take 200 approaches to get laid.  The trick is to not think about getting laid, but to tighten up your game.  Focus on the numbers because guess what?  After you get laid, you're gonna go right back out there to continue playing the numbers game.

If you get a girlfriend or wife, I highly suggest continue cold approaching women just to stay sharp with your game (you're not cold approaching to get laid, you're cold approaching to not get rusty).  Relationships don't always last and this is why you need to stay sharp so you will be able to continue getting women and it won't feel like you're starting all over again.

81,"Don’t Worry, You’re Making Progress (Bad Days are Ok.)",166,vaf4ra,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/vaf4ra/dont_worry_youre_making_progress_bad_days_are_ok/,12,"If there’s one thing us guys are good at – particularly those of us into self-improvement – it’s beating ourselves up and being a self-tyrant. We place these crazy unrealistic expectations upon our own heads, expecting daily perfection, never allowing for any misteps or mistakes anywhere along the way.  
You’ve gotta be realistic in your expectations of yourself – you’re a human, a human who’s going to make a million mistakes throughout your life… no matter how hard you try not to. The measuring stick you should be using is: if you’re making progress – ANY amount of progress – you’re on track. The journey of a thousand miles is measured in individual steps – not giant leaps. In other words, **simple daily habits consistently repeated over time, rather than huge leaps which require you to muster up all your willpower and motivation (which are always followed by a dropoff in motivation and then days/weeks of laziness & lack of progress).** Think *The Tortoise and the Hare*.  
This is the method I’ve used to achieve pretty much all of my goals – slow and steady progress over time.

A mate of mine was recently beating himself up, because he had a day where he only talked to 5 girls. He was really down on himself, because the previous day he’d talked to 15 girls, and felt like he was “going backwards”.  
But 2 weeks ago my homie wasn’t talking to ANY girls – now on his *worst* day he talks to 5 girls. He’s also much more self-aware, more confident, is working on his dating skills, is building a habit of going to the gym, and is tackling his challenges head-on like a man. He feels more alive. His worst day now is a million times better than his worst day from 2 weeks ago, let alone 2 months or 2 years ago.  


## Measure Progress Over a Longer Timescale

Don’t get caught up in comparing each and every single day to your previous day – take a step back, zoom out a bit and look at the general trend over time. Are you, generally speaking, happier and making more progress than you were a few months ago? Good, you’re on the right path. Your only goal should be to have a *general upwards trend over time*. You need to compare your *average* days to your past average days, and then see if you’re gradually improving over time.  
Example time: Let’s say 6 months ago you spent most days jerking off to porn, eating too much junk food, not talking to any girls, and not going to the gym. These days, you go to the gym a few times a week, you’ve cut down on the porn (though sometimes you relapse), you count your calories and don’t eat as much junk food, and you’re messaging a couple girls a week on online dating sites. Congratulations! Your average day now looks a *hell* of a lot better than it did 6 months ago.  


## Comparing Your Best…

You can also compare your *best* days to your past best days, and see if there’s a general improvement over time. Maybe 6 months ago your best day meant you went to the gym and messed around for 30 minutes, talked to 3 girls on *Tinder*, met up with some mates and smoked weed with them all night. A pretty decent day.  
But the last few weeks, your best day looks more like this: You go to the gym and absolutely crush your routine, putting more weight on the bar than you did the previous workout. You leave feeling amazing, strong, fucking *powerful*. You message 10 girls online, and even manage to work up the courage to talk to a random girl you see on the street during your lunch break. You listen to self-development podcasts on your commute to and from work, put in a very solid work day (other people are starting to notice & comment on your improved work ethic), and grab dinner with some mates, talking about your goals and latest achievements.  
Clearly a *much* better “best day” than your best day from 6 months ago. Congrats! You’re improving over time.  


## …And Comparing Your Worst.

And if you must compare your worst days and be a tyrannical cunt to yourself, fine. But at least be realistic in your comparisons. If you have a shit day now – like my client “only” talking to 5 girls instead of 15 – compare it to your shittiest day from 6 months ago. I’ll bet you 10 bucks that 6 or 12 months ago your worst day was the stuff of nightmares. **At the time, I bet you’d have given anything to have a day like the “bad” days you have now.**  
The *number* of bad days vs good days is also important. If a year ago 3 out of every 7 days were bad days – and now you only have a bad day once a week – that’s massive progress. It’s proof you’re on the right path, proof you’re doing the right things. Keep on going, and **don’t ever quit.**  
Another thing people do is compare their progress to other people’s progress. The issue with that is one of transparency – you’re acutely aware of *all* of your flaws and mistakes, but you don’t see even one-tenth of the mistakes the other person makes. You’re only seeing a *highlight reel* of their life – the parts they’ve chosen to show you. You have no idea what’s going on in their head – their fears, insecurities and doubts are all hidden from you.  
You look at them and think, “Damn, they make it look so easy. Meanwhile I’m here being such a fuckup”. Truth is they’re *exactly* like you, *and they’re not special.* They’re not immune from all the bullshit you’ve had to struggle with. Every person you look up to, every person you compare yourself to, had a million bad days where they were on the edge of despair. And chances are on their bad days, those people were beating themselves up, just like you are right now.  


## The Takeaway

Be more objective in how you judge your progress. Are your generally improving over time? Great, keep doing what you’re doing – and don’t stress about the occasional bad days. If you’re not improving over time – then make some changes, adjust your approach and try again.  
If you’re stressing about making up for lost time, or feel time is slipping away from you, remember [age doesn’t matter](https://killyourinnerloser.com/age-doesnt-matter). Just focus on making a little progress each day – one teensy tiny little baby step – and over time your success will snowball. **As long as you** ***never*** **quit, you’ll eventually get there.**  
Be nicer to yourself; **this self-improvement journey is supposed to be enjoyable**. Don’t beat yourself up if you have a bad day. Just focus on incremental improvements, and as long as you’re doing the right things, you’ll be on that upwards trend line.",1655011739.0
82,My parents red pill marriage-,157,v9t3zf,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v9t3zf/my_parents_red_pill_marriage/,31,"
I needed a place to write all this down so I’m sorry in advance if it’s hard to read, I’ll do my best to edit if interest arises.

I embraced red pill a few years ago and it worked well with everything I wanted. I am a 22 year old dude who’s trying to figure out what I like and the type of woman I would like later in life to have my kids with. So I’m trying to spin plates like most of you. I never realized how this red pill theory can actually work in a successful and happy marriage because I kept trying to compare my dad with me and how I do things. After a lot of introspection I realized that it’s not just about spinning plates, maintaining frame, taking responsibility when in need, but it’s about being a good leader and like great leaders they approve of you only in matters where you truly deserve an approval. 

My parents have been married for 30 years and I’ve been trying to figure out how the fuck they did it. This is not a one that you stumble on everyday, this is a relationship that is strong, passionate, and always growing. (My parents are in their late 50s and still have sex[I know this Bc I walked in on them about 6 months ago]). 

What I never realized is that my dad is a fucking brick wall, works a 9-5 to support our family no other reason, he takes sacrifices, pursued his dream by becoming a political refugee and escaping communism in the late 80s and is now living his American dream. He is unemotional to an extent, he barely gives my mom validation. (He doesn’t do this on purpose he’s just a stern man that comes from a family where his parents never showed any type of emotion to him). But when that validation comes whether that’s a hug, flowers, or some gifts once in a while it means a lot to her. This got me thinking about validation progressive overload with a plateau. You tell a woman you love her in the first month of dating what next? Okay you propose, next? Okay marry!? What’s after that. Woman get bored and are always looking for the next dose of validation but if that validation is the same for years it loses meaning. Supply and demand baby. Let those words actually mean something by Using them only when you need them and in scarcity. Just like diamonds are rare and expensive and sought after and I love you from your close partner will mean a lot if it’s rare and only when it’s truly meant. And look I’m not saying this approach is perfect, my mom is always complaining about My dad never telling her she looks nice or never telling her that he loves her. (“Never” is not true just extremely rare). But it’s a blessing in disguise because I believe if my dad was a man of ample validation their relationship would look different. Also I should mention that my dad does validate her by helping her with concerts that she puts up, spending hours and hours helping her prepare and so in hindsight that is a sort of validation because of the hours that he puts in helping her achieve her own goal. 

My mom works as his teammate, contributing to the relationship as a caregiver but also a smart intellectual that actually got my dad to read a lot, go to concerts, plays and watch movies. She made him a better man in exchange for him giving the motor and direction for the beautiful life they live now. 


TL DR
So how do you do it?

Don’t give in to Americans society bullshit of validating her(your loved one) with your words everyday. Do it when you mean it. Find other ways to stimulate her and keep wanting your approval. 

The greatest thing about all this is that my dad doesn’t even think about what he does, but the way he does things is the recipe to a successful and loving relationship.",1654935909.0

&#x200B;

I was waist deep in a 3 year relationship at that time. The pill taught me so much. It taught me how to not react, how to have discipline and self respect.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the end of the relationship, I pulled the plug and started my new journey of being a RedPilled single man. 

&#x200B;

I smashed. I conquered. I ploughed through the many wastelands of 5s,6s and 7s with God sent blessings from the occasional 8s, 9s and even 10s.

&#x200B;

Revolutionary. 

&#x200B;

I tried to convert the men who needed it around me. But I was seen as a lunatic. They didn’t want to hear any of it.

&#x200B;

It's how I first learnt the truth about love. Not the love you feel for family or close ones. It's a kind of love that's different. It's the love that involves sex.

  
The relationships I got in after being RedPilled and single, taught me so much.  
After a long time of seeing multiples of 2 or 3 plates during a period, I would proceed to spend more time than needed on 1 of them. Obviously because I enjoyed their company.

  
One of these decided to push exclusivity.  
I decided to agree. 4 months down the line she gets too passive aggressive for my likening, I tell her I'll leave her if she doesn't stop. Then I see her act up again.

I end it.

She's devastated. I move on quick and get more plates/respin old ones.   
Months go by and I barely hear from her. Suddenly she meets up with me, we have fun, she's well behaved. We then go back to her place and smash, with DEMOTED plate status contract accepted. Fuck yeah.  


Fast forward 2 years to next relationship.  
Same thing as before, the same proceedings but this time - I feel something is off.

She starts subtly asking for money, her tenant won't pay, she wants this, that etc etc. I never give her a penny. And I notice how she gives me sex and oral whenever I want.. However, she fakes her orgasms.  
It was a performance. All for me.

She even purposely left birth control pills around. I never took the bait thank God.  


This tripped me out.  


I couldn't believe I was fooled.  
But 1 year down the line, I meet another woman. I fall for the feelings, again.  
This time, she doesn't subtly hint for money. She offers to split everything, sometimes even paying.   
A few WEEKS into the agreement I see messages from another man she was involved with (intuition told me to gtfo but was too puss), I tell her to stop and that I will leave if it happens again. She proceeds to block him everywhere, I don't ask for it.   
But low and behold, it happens again.   
So I get out.  
I had a realisation at the time, and that was that the sex she gave me was the same as the golddigger.  
Except she wasn't doing it for money or babies... She was doing it for emotion/comfort/validation.  
She was lonely, and I was the best choice for her to do stuff on the weekends with while she would get fucked by Chad when she had time to spare.  


The strangest part about this past one was that I finally didn't give a shit. I finally understood why they do it and how I cannot be angry at them, it's just how they are now. A long time ago when the provider/fighter (beta/alpha) balance was in harmony, I truly believe that things weren't nearly as bad as they are now.

  
It's something that we have to get used to, accept and learn to love - in the correct way.

tl;dr Don't get married. Fuck that.",1654798677.0
84,What is the matrix and how we can escape it: prologue,0,v9ea0p,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v9ea0p/what_is_the_matrix_and_how_we_can_escape_it/,26,"I have understood the matrix for a few months but I was struggling to articulate it in a coherent way which prevented me from laying it out in front of other individuals who are not afraid to think differently than the rest.

Fortunately, I succeeded today.

**About this post**: In this post, I have explained what created the matrix in a very(times hundred) simple way. I might have skipped quite a lot of connecting points but I have covered the gist. This post will (I hope) help you understand the matrix from a different perspective. A perspective that will help you act against it. 

**Warning:** This post might offend you.

As it is Friday evening here, I smoked a lotta weed. I was watching videos in which a dude was describing Hinduism as “people who are praying to elephants” in a derogatory way.

Instead of being offended, it was funny to me as I am a Hindu myself.

It was not that dude’s fault.

Most people, including Hindus themselves, are seeing Hinduism(and any sects thereof like Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, etc.) through the eyes of Christian colonizers.

Let me take you back to the 17th century. When the “new world” was being discovered.

## India that was Bharat

When they colonized India in the 17th century, their perspective was the same they propagated the same image by writing books that were taught in universities.

Indian universities (like Nalanda University) were all destroyed by Muslim invaders who have been at it since the 8th century. As a result, there was a lack of a voice for Hindus to describe and define their own identity.

They are defined as a country of savages, worshipping elephants, a country of snake charmers, and what have you. 

This is horribly wrong. Here is a very recent example that will help you understand my point.

They(the British colonizers) plundered the crap out of India. without India, the allies could not have won WWII. We gave soldiers, capital, food, everything. It all came from people, which resulted in a severe economic crisis and famine, that ended up killing almost 7 million people.

Hitler killed 6 million Jews.

Churchill killed more Indians than that at the same time. The only difference is that history is written by the victors.

The UK was buying guns and supplies from the US. How did the UK pay for all of that? Remember they are an island with zero natural resources. Insignificant when you compare that with the tropical fertile India which was rich asf with natural resources like steel, coal, aluminum, gold, etc.

If India was a country of savages, how did it help them not only fund but win and prosper after a global conflict like that?

They propagated a wrong image to justify their actions to the world. So, our identity was curated and spread by the individuals who committed countless war crimes in Bharat (the remnants of which are identified as India today). That included the enslavement of people, abasement of women and children, and ethnic cleansing.

In the eyes of the world, they ""educated"" us, they made us ""civilized"". That is the way the British East Indian company justified the expenses towards the missionaries to the Crown.

Since the 16th century, (until colonization) Bharat (India's name in that century) contributed 25% of the world's GDP.

Hindus are fucked today (but slowly rising) because of two reasons:

1. repeated invasions from the Islamic state since the 8th century haven't stopped until now. Hindus are still persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and many parts of India by Muslim aggressors. However, we cannot retaliate because mainstream media tells the world it is “islamophobia” and Muslims are being targeted as they are a minority. This is because it distorts the widely accepted lie: “Islam is the religion of peace”. Shias and Sunnis are still fighting, go figure.
2. The devastating impact of Christian (also known as the religion of love) colonization. Not only did it destroy our identity but also ruined our systems of governance, education, and everything so we are struggling to pull ourselves up.

Just FYI, if you want to see the most fucked up things Christians have done, look at all the countries that were formerly colonized: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the entire African subcontinent, South America, USA(colonizers managed to kill all the natives here), Canada(killed them all here too). All those countries are fucked.

The problem lies with the inherent design of religion. I have explained it below.

## Why religion is cancer

The point of a religion(or any kind of spiritual belief system) has one purpose:

* Acting as a guide to a person’s existential issues and offering a path to salvation.

The problem is religion only offers one path to salvation. Deviating from the path will put you on the receiving end of terrible punishments that simulate hell. The religious punishments of both Christian and Islamic sets of beliefs are extremely horrible. They have been out of practice for now, almost. Many Islamic countries, which are labeled as “third world” by global bodies such as the UN (again, we are viewing them through a Christian lens), still punish people like that.

(If it doesn’t make any sense now, please read till the end.)

That is the reason the religions have one book. Deviating from the book means “not pure and/or divine” and you must be hit with a stick or something so that you should be “back on the path” through rigorous punishment.

The path to salvation.

## The organization of religion

Some people at the top will be the “keepers of the faith” who will decide whether people are on their best behavior and are living according to the Book.

They also enforced with force.

Not only that, they forced it on people who were not of their faith through war, enslavement(=because they were savages which made it justified), abasement, ethnic cleaning, etc.

At the bottom, there was one flaw in the design.

There is one path. The one. Nothing else is correct. No other path to salvation. The protectors and enforcers should be respected, worshipped, and accepted no matter how morally corrupt they actually are.

This is fucked up because someone told you that you should live a certain way. If you resist, you will be considered the enemy of the church or the mosque. You are too dangerous as you are a sinner and you will be hunted down and punished severely.

Why?

Because a long time ago, someone claimed that God told him to do all of that. That someone is the “messenger of god”.

Follow the book, else die.

Live by the rules that someone else laid out for you, or face the brutal consequences.

You have no say on the rules.

Sounds familiar?

## The construction of the matrix

In the western countries or any country that is marked as “safe” by an organization of western countries (the UN), there is a constitution.

It is a book of rules to live by.

You don’t get to decide what rules go in there.

(please don’t tell me your vote matters, because it doesn’t. The corporations run the west, they just change faces through politicians. The proof is simple: the western world has gone bananas. Do you think people wanted this?)

The protectors and enforcers of the book are to be respected and cooperated with. No matter what. Otherwise, brutal consequences.

The same goes for all the indoctrination institutions like the school, colleges, etc., that don’t encourage free thinking by punishing disagreement with a present, prevalent belief even after presenting enough evidence.

Some people change some things in the book. But the foundations are the same as a religion.

One path to salvation.

## The counter-argument

“But women used to be virgins.”

Yes, yes, yes.

There were a lot of perks too.

At this point I will point out certain things, you decide whether the good is better or the bad:

1. It created the matrix today as we know it.
2. It enslaved most of the civilizations of the world. The list of countries was mentioned earlier in this article.
3. It started industrialization which ended up destroying the world. The people who decided the balance between sustainability and development were the protectors and enforcers of the book.
4. Colonialism led to imperialism, which led to consumerism. This is particularly the west. The colonizers eliminated the natives and ended up colonizing themselves.
5. Everything is a “product” in America. Because they are not people, they are users. They are to be interpreted via a metric called “customer engagement”. They are to be consumed.
6. Just like the UK justified consuming India. Just like the Spanish and the Portuguese consumed south America.
7. In the USA, everything is a product. Food is a product, engineered to stimulate your taste buds in a certain way that keeps you coming back even though it eventually kills you.
8. Healthcare, education, well-being, affection, everything is a product in the US.

And now they are fucked.

I will say that if there was any good(i don’t think there was because the plight of women was actually terrible under the realm of religion. Both Christianity and Islam tortured the hell out of women for a multitude of reasons that was justified by their respective books.)

## So, is there a solution

Yes. 

It is simple: accept multiple paths to salvation.

## Before you comment

1. I know that there must be a ton of questions that need answering. The most common one might be “how to implement the solution”. I appreciate that thought because we should all think about it. Unfortunately, I have only understood that answer halfway.
2. I will post that half slowly as it will help us dismantle the matrix in a safe way and not cause a complete social meltdown and plunge us all into the civil war.
3. Within the post also there are a lot of things that could have been explained with more clarity with proof (historical, factual, statistical, anthropological, anecdotal). I will do it in the upcoming posts.
4. This post was an extreme distillation of lots of knowledge I have accrued over the past couple of years.
5. If you think that I could be up to something here, please let me know.
6. This is a group of individuals who aren’t afraid to think. I think the above post is something that you haven’t thought of but is intriguing (I hope).
7. If that is not the case, I don’t think pursuing this avenue of thinking will be a good investment. I will not post any more posts if that becomes the reality.
8. Think of me as your younger, slower brother(if you are a guy, lmao. Ladies, I am currently single, lol.), and leave the snide out of your comments.
9. Again, I know I need to prove all of the above posts with solid proofs and I will because all of them exist. You can see them if you try. Providing proof is the first thing that I will do in my next posts.
10. Topics of my upcoming posts:
   1. Colonialism, types of colonialism, and the relationship between colonizer and the colonized.
   2. The difference between the Hindu Dharma and religion. 
   3. How the Hindus are different from the Abrahamic religions?
   4. Understanding the Hindu Dharma through a Hindu lens. (see b.)
   5. Why the Hindus are important in the context of escaping the matrix?
   6. How to escape the matrix by applying the Hindu philosophy?
   7. (suggest)

P.s. I am high asf as I write this, so pardon me if there are any grammatical mistakes, English is not my first language, but since I belong to a country colonized by the British, I have been speaking, reading, and writing in English since I was six.",1654885819.0
85,Scarcity Does Create Value,469,v71clb,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v71clb/scarcity_does_create_value/,90,"I'm 30, and I met this girl in a fitness class, absolute dime. She's 28, a latina, fitness freak, and an amazing figure (hard to put into words), really good looking girl.

I was a beta male for most of my life because I didn't know any better. Long story short I became fixated on this girl. Initially she was super into me, (sending me seductive snaps, long messages, would reply right away, etc). I made the mistake of always being available to her, offering her rides, offering her other shit, basically having blue balls as the gay male girlfriend.

Despite all of this weakness from me, she agreed to go out on a date. After the evening she texted me the next day saying she's looking for friendship only because she was coming off a relationship. I stupidly agreed hoping she would come around. Big mistake, because nice guys finish last. Never agree to a platonic friendship when you want more.

I would text her and would be left on read. I would reply to her IG stories and be left on read. One time I texted her asking if she wanted to go to the museum and she left me on read for a full week and then replied with ""Sorry I'm just seeing this now"". Yeah right, what a load of horseshit.

My friend recommended me to read the book ""The Way of a Superior Man"", and also started watching Corey Wayne on Youtube a bit, and I started to realize my big flaws. I immediately texted her saying I was no longer interested in a platonic friendship, and to reach out if your stance changes. I then disappeared completely. The guy that used to give her non stop advice, helped her move, would genuinely care about her, vanished from her a life for a while. I even stopped going to that fitness class to avoid seeing her and found another one.

I started seeing other women, started focusing more on my career. I'm talking to 3 different girls now I met off Hinge. I noticed she still always watched my IG stories living the good life and hanging out with friends. I wasn't fixated on her anymore.

Then about 6 weeks later, I was on a date with this other broad and she texted me asking how I'm doing. I looked at the text, and with a huge grin on my face, I put the phone back in my pocket and enjoyed my current date. When I got home after absolutely fucking this other girl's brains out, I looked at my phone and decided I'll reply the next day. Went to bed an absolute champ that night.

When I replied the next day mid morning she replied back almost instantly telling me how great it was to hear from me and she wanted to meet up for drinks. I kept it cool, cordial, but I didn't text her a lot, I just setup the time and date of when we were supposed to meet for drinks and ended the convo.

When we met up she was all over me. I can tell. The body language, the touching my arm, the eye contact, it was crystal clear. When we left the pub I kissed her in the parking lot. I drove to my apartment, and our clothes were off the minute we entered the living room. The best fuck I've ever had because I've been wanting to bang her for ages and her fit body with those womanly hips were pure bliss. This was 2 days ago.

Moral of the story: When you stop giving a shit and do your own thing, it creates attraction. Woman are attracted to men who's feelings are unclear. She was wondering about me which reignited the interest.",1654621136.0
86,Building Rapport is Bullshit,183,v4s61x,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v4s61x/building_rapport_is_bullshit/,92,"Now just like my last post, the spergs are going to take the title literally, but here we go.

The advice is simple. If you have never met a girl before in person it should not take you more than **3-4 text messages** to get her phone number from whatever OLD app or social media app you opened her on.

On OLD especially, texts should go something like this:

*Hey Alessia*

*Hey*

*What's your number*

*I'd have to get to know you better*

*No one fell in love over text / nothing important was ever written with thumbs / you can't really know someone until you look them in the eyes and feel their energy*

(xxx) - xxx - xxxx

&#x200B;

# Keep it dumb simple

If there isn't anything important to say, don't say it. By opening yourself up to rejection you polarize these girls that you should be screening for **high interest**. Either they say yes or no.

**If the girl has an ounce or two of interest she won't fumble the opportunity of getting with you just because of her pride.**

# Play the numbers game

The same goes with talking to girls in person. You want to **play the numbers** game and screen for high interest. If your SMV isn't very high naturally you will be pulling lower SMV girls (most of the time). However, when you play the numbers game you come to find out that **your SMV is extremely fluid and volatile** with varying types of women. I know some beautiful women who only go for dudes that are 300lb bouncers/security guards. Other girls just like ugly masculine guys‎. It's a matter of finding out for yourself, and you won't be able to do it by beating around the bush.

# Rapport ≠ interest

You probably have a false belief that you must build rapport to raise her interest. **This is not necessarily true**. By taking the direct approach you give off a high-status vibe and an unmatched **aura of confidence**, so although polarizing may weed out the *maybe* girls, it generally turns the **yes** girls into **FUCK YES** girls off the bat.

I have personally found that the approach that cuts the bullshit and gets straight to the point is absolutely the most efficient way to get to a yes or no and 5x more effective in not shooting yourself in the dick and saying something stupid. You have to read **Mode One by Alan Roger Currie** to understand what I'm talking about if you haven't experienced it yet.

It probably took me my first 50 or 100 cold approach rejections to really completely get over the idea that rejection matters at all, and people always ask me how I'm so confident in approaching girls. It's because I put in the work and **failed many more times than they have even tried**, and doing it quickly became second nature.

# Setting up the date

Now that you've gotten her number, you can text her her name back herself to alert her when she receives your text and even reminds her of how direct you are. This is what I like to do, as the name stays at the top of the messages and I can search their name in the iMessage search bar to find them without having to save their contact (I suggest never saving a girl's contact that you haven't fucked). Your next text should be along the lines of **""I'm taking you out for X at Ypm on Z day""**. She agrees and sends you her address, you pick her up and enjoy the rest of your night.

If you repeat this process even a dozen times you will have a feeling of mastery because you're **prepared for every situation** and possibility at this point. That's when you come to realize that **even outside** your little date protocol you can have the same confidence. That was the point when I truly left the matrix and realized how endless the possibilities are if you create those opportunities.

# What game really is

Remember, game comes after your intentions are already clear, and she knows you want to fuck her. This is the point when if she is interested she will start to shit test you. The only other time you will get shit tests from a girl without her knowing your intentions is when you're in a social circle setting and she wants to spike your interest without appearing too direct in front of other people.

# Embrace your masculine, sociable, cocky side

Tying it back to rapport. When you're ACTUALLY ON THE DATE you can go ahead and build a little bit of rapport, trust, and comfort like any **normal** person would have a **normal** conversation. Slowly you'll tweak your game and say **cockier, riskier things** and naturally be more sexual in your conversations. Girls honestly remember you by the first 30 minutes of what you did and how you acted on the first date, then later you can just coast and relax when you know they like you. This is the point when you apply heavier kino.

# Conclusion

**Rapport is not necessary for sexual attraction**. They just need enough (not a lot) to trust that you're not a weirdo and get some comfort to do what they really want to you. Most of the rapport I build is **after sex** because that's when it's actually needed. They don't want to regret fucking you, so give them comfort and cuddles after sex.

This was quite a long post, but let me know your thoughts and ideas because this is only my experience and I would love to hear what you guys have to say.",1654359347.0

*In a sub flooded by incels and cooks, there just might be a rising Chad or two. A rising slayer who’s gazing towards a fresh horizon of juicy pussy while breaking free of the chains of betahood. In a world filled with black pills, angry feminists, shit tests and cucks, he who muster the courage to take strides towards the path of adventure is who I write for. The brave young man who swallowed the red pill and dreaming of feasting with the Gods in Chadhalla.*

*As I absorbed and armed myself with the knowledge from the holiest of Side Bars and tread forward; I share to you, news from the front lines of the Pussy Wars.*

&#x200B;

\--

&#x200B;

I was visiting a new city for work and stayed over the weekend. so I fired up the ol’ slut trap and started swiping.

Matched with a Tinderella who looked nice and had just started studying here. We kept it short and sweet in the dm’s, scheduled a meet up the next day and it was off to the races.

We both got there 10min late and met up in the queue to get a table. She was way better looking in real life than in the pictures and I was taken aback. I thought *damn she is fine*, and in a classy way too. Not in the plastic thot kind of way, but more like the Dior/celebrity type. I actually felt my pulse rise, a girl hasn't made me feel like that in a while now.

&#x200B;

I tightened my shit up ‘cause ya boy is not a slave to his hindbrain, and we enjoyed some drinks outside in the sun. The conversation went alright, getting to know each other and joking around a bit. She was a rich girl from the capital city, ballet dancer and studied Russian. She was straight forward, clever and I would guess had rejected countless betas.

Conversation ebbed and flowed, and eventually the sun went down. Three hours had gone by at this point. We relocated to another restaurant for some more drinks and some snacks. It turned out to be a bit more fancy than I expected, but I played it cool and we got a table. 

*Note to self: Check out the places around before you go with a date there and have some options*. 

We were hungry and got food and a bottle of wine, stayed two more hours and talked, apparently I was her first tinder date ever. The bill got pretty high, but I enjoyed the food so whatever. Actually, she paid the bill, so welcome to my feminist utopia country.

&#x200B;

After dinner I was ready to pull her back to my hotel, but she was hesitant and wanted some more drinks. It was 10pm on a Saturday night so I said sure. We got to another place and started drinking. I was a bit buzzed at this point and the conversation got bad. We argued because she was a spoiled brat who basically lived in a bubble of rich people, and was very picky and entitled. We struggled a bit to understand each other since we are from different places so that didn't help. She was basically accusing me of being from low class peasant stock *(which in all honesty I am and I got offended)*. Shit tests was raining down on me like German artillery on Verdun.

I talked a bit of random shit and tried to steer the conversation back to something more fun and flirtatious. It did not work and it became awkward, which she explicitly did say. I was pretty sure it was game over at this point, but I pulled back and regrouped my game.

I caught myself acting like a bitch and recognized the shit test. I called the situation out and with all the amused mastery I could muster and said:   
\-*“Look, I know it turned sour now but damn, what did you expect. You are not supposed to be out on a first date for 8 hours. Of course it gets stale just sitting and talking for this long.”*   
We agreed and reckoned that the date in general had been quite good up to this point.

&#x200B;

We finished our drinks and headed out. A bunch of drunk shady guys stood in the street and she was looking fine. I grabbed her around the hips and steered her through the pack of hungry wolves so she knew I wasn't no scared beta bitch. I caught a cab and asked her if she wanted to come back with me. I didn't really think she wanted to because of the argument and the ride to my hotel was 20 minutes. She was hesitant, so I told her to jump in the cab and she actually did. We had a good time in the cab with some touching and laughter. 

When we got to the room it was on. I slapped her ass, choked her good and pulled her hair, which I enjoyed because of her behaviour earlier, she enjoyed it too and it was nice to release the tension. Fucked her again in the morning same thing, and off she went as a happy customer.

&#x200B;

*TD;LR: A date a bit out of the ordinary for me. It went from damn to good, to bad and then back to good. I sharpened my game and released myself from the defeatist mindset that she was out of my league. A challenge for sure, but she ended up face down biting pillow like a good girl.*",1654322427.0

So I have known that couple for years. They are swingers, but the kind that goes to the very extreme of kinky. They did gang-bangs, orgies, triple penetration, BDSM, porno etc. The girl is the most adorable chick you'll ever seen, as in, you'd think the butter melts in her mouth. So unless you know what's going on in their house, you wouldn't believe she's seen more than 5 dicks.  
They had a female friend accompanying them in their adventures, and she partook in the same activities. I have nothing against it, but that's some hardcore stuff; to each his own. So for years, she would get dicked down in every hole by dozens of strangers. Meanwhile, she meets this dude, a rich beta, the nicest guy on earth. Polite, educated, docile, you name it.   
They just got engaged, so I thought that, well, he's okay with her past. But no, the dude has no idea. She cut everybody from her past, including my friends, in order to avoid being slandered or uncovered. So this guy genuinely believes he's dating a nice girly girl who's barely done more than missionary in college. They are on their engagement trip as I write.   
Imagine being that man ? Fuck me.  
My own fiancee was a slut, but I knew about it and embraced it because I love whores. I have been with a lot of women and I needed someone with unlimited sexual energy. That guy is a textbook nice guy, and he's royally fucked. When the truth is revealed, he will blow his brains.  
What can I say ? Women are manipulative and evil.

89,Is Hypergamy natural? A competing theory would be that women are hardwired for monogamy. They are only hypergamous in the search for the One.,73,v3zfpk,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v3zfpk/is_hypergamy_natural_a_competing_theory_would_be/,61,"The more I observe women, the more I realize that their sex lives seem to  revolve around one ( two at most) sex partner who really did it for them. Everything they do can be explained by their relationship with that sex partner, including the fact they may have not met him yet.

The typical modern woman will go through a phase of experimentation ( late teen, early twenty), until they plateau with  that one partner ( early , mid twenty). Past that stage, the stories tend to converge.

They get into a relationship, get cheated on, cheat back or leave only to throw themselves back into a situationship with the One who may or may not have moved on to a new main woman. It's surprising how many women who go on multiple dates but consistently sleep with only one guy: the dreaded ex, the One.

From that point on, every future relationship is measured against that relationship, or is a reaction to how that relationship unfolded. This is where red pill concepts of ""imprints"", or ""Alpha Window"" comes into play.

She might reluctantly settle for a provider while her heart(her box of wonder)  still belongs to the One. She might go on a hot girl summer spree to prove something to him or herself. She might alter her appearance for the same reason. Etc..

In that regard, there is a contradiction between Hypergamy demanded by feminism and woman's natural ability to create unique, durable bonds with only a few partners. The tragedy of the modern woman ( anxious, constantly depressed, never happy) is this nagging feeling of missed reproductive opportunity with the One, who they may have either already met , or may not seem to find, despite the numerous partners they have gone through.

The Red Pill is then a lot more straightforward, albeit harder to swallow. If you're not the One for the girl, you're wasting your time. There is absolutely no point in getting into a LTR or, God forbids, a marriage.

**If you don‘t control your mind, someone else will.**

Back when I was working as a middle-school music teacher, I observed an exchange between to kids that stuck with me.

A girl and a boy were having a verbal fight. They must have been about 11 years old and you could see the first signs of their teenage-personality emerging.

The girl was more popular than the boy and she did not want him to sit in a certain chair for reasons known to her alone. 
Provoked by his refusal to comply, she unloaded a barrage of middle-school insults at him. „You are stupid!“ - „You smell like shit!“ - „Nobody likes you!“

The boy tried his best to remain calm, but she found all the right buttons to push. Despite his best efforts to keep his mouth shut, he took a big gulp of air and merely yelled one thing: „And you are UGLY!!“

Not the most sophisticated insult, sure - but he said it with such *conviction*. The girl started crying almost instantly. It was as if the boy used a mind control spell that blew straight past her defenses.

Now, since people are at their core grown up teenagers, it made me wonder: Is this happening to adults?

**Evolutionary Grooming Tech**

90% of human communication does not serve the purpose of trading information. It is an evolved tool for social grooming. It later has been repurposed into a device for sharing complex and abstract information.

The original use of language was pressure equalization between the agitated limbic systems of primate-tribes. 

As a primate, you could make dominant, agressive noises, which where then met with submissive, deescalating noises. Both you and your fellow primate then avoided a fight that could potentially leave both of you with crippling injuries - thereby conserving the strength of the tribe in the process.

The more our vocal tracts evolved, the bigger our verbal arsenal grew and the more adept we became at restructuring our social network.

**Your inner voice**
With our ability to talk we developed the ability to *self*-talk - which then allowed us to restructure our inner mental network, similar to how we structured our social relations. 

It allows us to equalize-pressure within ourselves.

This pressure-equalization usually works by bouncing the idea around in our brain over and over until cause and effect have been understood. You re-experience the stimulus over and over, as if it was happening to you again.

Once we „made sense“ out of something, it is processed. The bigger the emotional charge of a stimulus, the bigger our need to make sense of it. The more complete our understanding of a matter is, the easier it is for us to process.

Once something is processed, our psyche settles back into equilibrium. We become calm again.

If we are unable to process something fully, we get stuck on loop, compulsively playing the same thing over and over in our head - or eventually repressing it entirely.

**Magic and Madness**

Early humans believed language had magic powers. This evident in the German word for „spell“: „Zauberspruch“ translates to „magic speech“. And they were not wrong. 

Hearing or reading the right words at the right time can be the catalyst to turn men into either indomitable warriors or doubtful wimps. It sure must have appeared like magic to these people. 

Talking, hearing others talk or even hearing themselves talk could kick-start alchemical processes to clear the mind and reassemble the personality into something stronger.

Or it could irrevocably crush an improperly assembled or weakened mind.

The boy from the story forced the girl to feel sad - and there was nothing she could do about it. It was like a mind-control spell.

But these were kids - it doesnt work like that with adults, does it?

**How people hack your brain every day**

The more confused and the more emotional you are, the better your brain can be controlled by external influence. 

If your inner voice can not process external stimuli at a faster rate than they arrive, your mind will become overwhelmed. 
The more confusing and the more emotional the stimulus, the more overwhelmed you will be. And the more overwhelmed you are, the more reactive you become.

This has seen loads of professional use in advertising, politics, media and in hypnosis. The process is always similar:

- The topic at hand is made to appear relevant with a strong emotional stimulus
- You get a package of information that is either conflicting or purposely lacking key data
- While your brain is running hot decoding and processing the onslaught, you are provided with ready-made solutions as a shortcut. 
- Since your brain is a costly piece of tissue calory-wise, evolution has bred you to be more likely to accept ready-made explanations than finding your own solutions to the problem.
- The explanation is lacking, inconsistent, circular or otherwise insufficient and you are denied any sense of closure.
- This process is repeated often, compounding its effectivity with each new exposure.

Once your are able to spot this pattern, you will see it EVERYWHERE. News networks and social media companies use it to bait you into more consumption. Hollywood writers use it to write engaging storylines. And people intuitively use it on their peers to live rent-free in each others head.

The use of this technique is prevalent in our society to a terrifying degree. The majority of our populace spend their entire lives in a state of medium-to-high agitation.

However, there are people who adapted to this.

The drama-queens and energy-vampires of this world use it to suck energy and attention from their victims. It elevates them by keeping everyone else down. Here is how you recognize it.

- they blow little things out of proportion to make them appear significant
- They overreact emotionally, making themselves harder to ignore
- Their communication is purposefully vague, making it hard to logically deconstruct what has been argued.
- They make no attempt to make themselves understood. In fact, trying to understand them will suck exponentially more energy from you. 
- Everything they say or ask takes way more energy to be understood and answered than it takes for them to make it up.
- Nothing ever gets solved or closed. The longer the interaction continues, the more gets put on the table, and the more open threads you are unable to properly tie up.
- They slow down communication by either jumping topics or by being unreachable, hanging up the phone or leaving you on read.
- The conversations always contain loads of hypothetical scenarios.
- To them, if engagement in or escalation of the drama is reached, it feels like success. Their loop is closed, their thoughts are processed, while you are still agitated and busy or even stuck processing. It energizes them and leaves you drained.
- Once it appears like you are able to turn the interaction into something productive, they get „tired“, because they experience an adrenaline dump and they will try to withdraw before any closure is reached.

If you feel this sounds a lot like that one horrible ex or toxic family-member of yours - you are likely correct.

**Anti-magic to defend your mind**

As with any type of self-protection, the best defense is making sure you don‘t get attacked in the first place. 

**Stay away from toxic people and cut them out of your life as much as possible.** 
Stop watching the news, stop consuming social media, reduce your interaction with people who make their money from agitating you.

They are not incentivized to provide you with anything enlightening or satisfying. They are incentivized to syphon your attention and mental capacity and sell it off to advertisers. That is how they feed their kids.

**Clear your mind from mental and emotional clutter**

Depending on how much self-work or even self-therapy you have done in your life, chances are, you have never experienced your mind 100% clutter free.

However, once you are aware of the problem, decluttering your mind is as easy as decluttering your living space. 
It is a matter of consistently clearing up more than you mess up. Essentially, you go monk mode for a while to avoid excessive stimulation.

A great way to achieve this is working to reduce physical clutter first: Clean up your apartment, downsize, minimize. Get rid of everything you do not need. Make it a mental habit to throw things out and let them go.
If your brain has to process less visual stimuli, there is more band-with to process what is going on inside. 

Reduce your decision-work by building routines. Eat the same simple meals every day. Wear the same 5 outfits. Don‘t buy anything non-essential. 

Take lots of walks in nature. Walking enhances cross-brain communication, synching your intuition with your logic.

You will notice the process beginning to work when you become tired much more quickly than usual. You will need lots of sleep for a few days. If that happens: Sleep. Your brain needs it to restructure itself.

The final goal here is to get adjusted to the lowered noise-level in your brain, with your mind eventually becoming a pristine mountain lake.

This then tunes your senses to recognize manipulation and agitation before they grow to extreme levels, allowing yourself to counter-steer early on. 

This is of highest importance in a relationship - because trying to correct your LTRs behavior becomes increasingly difficult with every transgression you let slide.

**Verbal Judo**

Sometimes (verbal) confrontation can not be avoided and DAREing is not an option - for example in a professional environment.

The main aim of someone who is trying to manipulate, agitate or dramatize is to bait you into a high-effort reaction.
High-effort reactions make you easy to read, predict and manipulate. 

Therefore, always react to drama with *less effort* than it takes to create the drama. 

A great way is to ask open ended question but avoid making any concessions nor offering solutions.

„Yeah? How come?“
„What do you mean by that?“
„And why would you say that?“
„Okay?“

Don‘t argue - it always takes way more energy to counter-argue a point than to make it up.

On that note, another strategy is the „Half-ass counter-point“.

„Yeah… no.“
„That‘s not really how this works.“
„I feel, it is like xyz.“
„That‘s just, like, your opinion, man.“

State your point, don‘t argue it. Signal with your tone that you are fine to agree-to-disagree. If the other person *still* wants to engage, they will have to start arguing your point - which is your cue to go right back to the lazy open ended questions.

Once you clear your mind consistently remind yourself to not swallow any agitation-bait, you will gain rocksolid composure and your mind will finally belong to yourself again.",1654189745.0
91,Is this why people are generally attracted to those of their own race?,4,v3euv2,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v3euv2/is_this_why_people_are_generally_attracted_to/,55,"Read [this article](https://www.amren.com/news/2018/05/ethnic-racial-genetic-interests-differences/) a couple days ago and I am still semimind-blown.

Notable excerpt: ""a biracial child contains and reproduces fewer of the distinctive genes from any one of its parents than does a monoracial child. In other words, a child born to a man and women of the same ethny is genetically closer to its parents than is a mixed-race child, because the parents have many distinctive genes in common, and the child is therefore a combination of genes that make it close to both parents. A mixed-race child is genetically more distant from both parents because half its genes come from a parent from a different — and genetically distant — ethny.

The relationship can be understood this way. A parent has a certain base-line kinship with his child no matter who the other parent is, but is genetically closer to his children if he marries within his ethny. This gain in parental kinship is foregone to some extent when the other parent is of a different race or ethny. An average European white who has a child with a typical African foregoes 66 percent of the parental kinship he would have gained if he had had the child with another European. An Englishman who picks a Danish rather than an English spouse loses only one percent of the parental kinship to be gained from an English spouse. Choosing a Bantu mate would mean the loss of 92 percent of the parental kinship that would have been gained with an English mate. This figure, which is close to 100 percent, raises the theoretical possibility that if an Englishman has a mixed, English-Bantu child, the child will receive so many non-European genes from the Bantu parent that the Englishman is only slightly more genetically related to his own child than he is to a random stranger from his own ethny.""

So if you reproduce with someone of your own race, you would get more out of what you invest because more of your distinctive genes get passed on.

Might this be why people are generally attracted to those of their own race?",1654192869.0
92,[FIELD REPORT] First time pulling from a day club,85,v2jf6k,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v2jf6k/field_report_first_time_pulling_from_a_day_club/,33," **Stats:**

Age: 28

Race: Eastern Asian

Height: 5'7

Location: Las Vegas  


**Preface:** It's been pretty busy with work and with my FWBs recently so I haven't been able to run game as much. Also, through the friends I've made via night game, I've developed a social circle where we just essentially just go out and party, especially when my friends have guest in town. Which is exactly what happened last weekend. My wing D had some friends visiting and it was just a rage fest for 3 days. I met up with them at a day club. This is my second time at a day club. My first time was 8 months ago when I first started game so I was looking forward to the change in environment.  


My wing's friend had a table so my first priority was to bring girls to the table. The thing with tables is that it alters my game a bit. When I open sets, I'm essentially rushing the interaction to screen if I should bring them to the table. I have to be more selective with the girls too. They all gotta be hot and at the minimum somewhat receptive. I don't want to bring girls who's just looking for free liquor, not that the liquor matters, it's the time wasted on these girls. Inviting girls to a table is LIGHT WORK. I could do that in my sleep. What's difficult is screening for the right girls to bring back. I opened probably 15-20 sets with nothing really sticking. I still brought a few girls to the table and went back out to recruit more. 

**Set:**

1. I saw 4 white girls near the edge of the pool. I approached the one who was dancing. Let's call her Ashley. I opened with a cold read and it was an immediate hook. I spent probably 60 seconds establishing some rapport. Pretty much just location cold reads and guessing games. Turns out she's from Montana. I told her ""Hey, tell your friends you're gonna go with me to the table"". She thought about it for 2 seconds and said yes and informed her friends.   


Now, I used very specific language here. I didn't say ""hey, tell your friends let's all go to the table."". I said just her. This is because, there were too many girls there by this time and I wasn't trying to invite all 4 (yes too many girls is a bad thing as you'll read in my next FR).   


After she told her friends, I did hand of god and just lead. Just grab her hand and GO. I lead her through the crowded ass day club and we finally arrived at the table. I introduced her to some friends to build social proof not that it really matters tbh. Offered her a drink. We started dancing and grinding together. I go in for the kiss and make out. Pretty routine stuff here. We continue to make out and dance for probably 15-20 minutes.   


At this point, it's super obvious what the next step is. I knew it was time to pull but I also wanted to just keep partying. My friends were there. Tons of girls. We were at a table. The day club was lit as hell. But no, I knew what my objectives were and I must carry them out. So I told her let's grab drinks else where less loud. She agrees. I take her hand and just go.   


We had quite a long walk to the garage. I had to park at a different garage because it was so packed. During the walk, we had a pretty genuine and authentic conversation. No game-y stuff. Just a real conversation about our lives, family, job, etc. This is what I think game should be like. Good game should be 80% genuine interaction and 20% of the game-y stuff. Anyways, we get back to my place and yall know how it goes ;)  


**Key Take Aways:** 

1. You gotta persevere: I went through hella sets that didn't go away. If I gave up at set 15 then this would have never happened. Hell, some nights I go through 20 sets with nothing. Just gotta try again the next day. 
2. Go out ALOT, do it solo and you'll start to build a social circle: I started this journey solo 10 months ago. I went out 4-5 nights a week solo for like 2 months before meeting a wing. Now, I've met so many dope guys. My squad here is hella lit. Two weekends ago, my roommate had hella people in town visiting and it was another rage fest, just like this previous weekend. My point is, if you're like me and you love partying and meeting girls, and you want to build a social circle around those elements, then you gotta just go out ALOT and go solo until you start noticing guys and guys start noticing you. 
3. Table game: if you get a table, especially in vegas, don't just bring any girl to the table. Screen them first or you'll end up wasting a valuable resource: time. 
4. Let her be your champion: I didn't speak one word to Ashley's friends. I told her to tell her friends that she's coming with me. They are far more likely to be okay with her tell them than me telling them. 
5. Lead: always lead. It's attractive.",1654096851.0
93,Field Report: Pulled A Gorgeous Italian Girl Home After A Shitty Night At The Club,31,v2c4bg,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v2c4bg/field_report_pulled_a_gorgeous_italian_girl_home/,38,"Posted this field report on the South Asian sub but figured that you guys might like it as well. I rarely see other South Asian dudes post about their pulls because most Brown guys who do well usually keep all the secret sauce to themselves instead of sharing. 

I hope this post helps you guys learn a couple of new things. Things that I did wrong, and things that I did correct, especially for fellow South Asian dudes.

**Gametime!**

This was another one of those Friday nights. Me and a couple of my other boys had booked a hotel down at the city centre near where all the hottest clubs are. The plan was to pregame there with some drinks and either ecstacy or blow and then go hit the clubs and find some cute girls. My boys Alex and Jerome were supposed to join us, but Jerome didn't end up making it out with us that night. Alex still pulled through. He's one of my best dawgs I go out partying with. Coolest Whiteboy you'll ever meet. Preface: I'm Dravidian/Tamil 6'0 185lbs ripped and good looking as I've been told and Alex is around 5'9 prettyboy ladies man. Me and Alex are both in our early 20s. We met up at the hotel 11pm drank a few shots and took some E. Found a club and ubered there. We went to the club and it was bust. Too many dudes and not enough girls. Every time I talked to a girl she would either turn away from me or act disinterested and end the conversation. Alex wasn't having any luck either which is odd considering he's really good looking. I think we both approached around 12-15 girls each maybe and nothing happened. Just dead ends. I'm usually only into skinny/fit girls but I was getting annoyed at how the night was going because I usually at least get some girls who like me by this point so I approached this one chubby girl. She had really nice skin/hair and was East African. Went up said ""Hey hows your night going"" with a slight smile and suggestive eyes and took her hand. I turned her around and let her dance on me. Made small talk, and made some suggestive comments sexually. She showed me her tiktok and that she had around 150,000 followers which I found kinda cool. We ended up making out, but tbh I was ready to go home at this point. Alex was just standing next to me and this girl the whole time as he didn't find any girls for himself. It's like 2:30 am.


 We headed outside the club and were just chilling and talking about calling a ride back home to the hotel. All of a sudden this girl just came onto my boy Alex and would just circle around him and come closer then back away. Me and Alex found this mad funny cause it came outta nowhere. Out the corner of my eye I see her friend. Pretty ass girl with a crop top and short skirt not designed for this cold ass weather. 5'6 Big titties soft smooth skin with a tight ass and blonde highlights. Let's say her name is Angela. I go straight up to her and say ""Hey I'm Desifluent"" with a cheeky smile and I pulled her closer and started making out with her. It was cold, so I brought her close to my chest and helped warm her up. I looked over and Alex was making out with his girl too. We gave each other a cheeky head nod. It was game on. We asked the girls what their plan was and they wanted to go back to their nearby apartment so I called an uber there. During the ride I fingered my girl and whispered dirty stuff in her ear while also kissing her on the neck and making out. We went upstairs and saw Alex and his girl go to a room, while Angela pulled me to hers. She pulled out a bag of coke, made a big ass line and sniffed that shit like it was nothing. We were making out and I was sucking on her tits while she was straddling me and then she started to get nervous. She didn't wanna take things further. Her pussy was on my thighs and I could feel it throbbing through her panties. I asked her what was up and she asked me if I do this with every girl. I said ""Do I look like I do?"", She said yeah and asked me my bodycount. I just asked for hers and she said 9. I just continued making out with her and she ended up giving me head, but didn't let me smash. I told her she gave great head, and then cuddled with her till we both fell asleep. Morning came, it was time to leave, I told her I really liked my time with her and that she was a great girl who I wanted to see again. I took her number and left. Me and Alex went back to the hotel, took our stuff, signed out and headed back home after another crazy ass night of stories we could tell our other friends who don't come out with us. What about Angela? I ended up smashing her the next week after a date downtown.

**Lessons To Learn**

Know that every night at the club/bar won't be amazing. You're not gonna get an amazing response from every single girl you approach. Learn to regulate your emotions so that you don't develop depression after getting rejected a bunch of times. Your emotional state shouldn't be swayed by the opinion of strangers who don't know the real you.

**Pick a venue that has a good ratio of men to women.** 

Me and Alex fucked up on planning this night out. We tried this spot for the first time expecting it to be good, and the ratio of men to women fucked us over. You are fully responsible for your experience on a night out. There's no point having putting all this effort in just to pick a shitty club to go to which ruins your night.

**Learn that the Night is always young!**

 No matter what time it is, especially if you're at the city centre, young hot girls are almost always looking for an afterparty or guys to go home with. Don't write a night off just cause the club was shitty. You might actually get more ass by chatting up the girls outside the club especially if its a group of 3 girls or less.

**Pick a great wingman/wingmen**. 

I personally never go out with guys that aren't gonna help me pull. Simple as that. The only exception is if I'm going out with 1 or 2 guys who I'm tryna help/teach but other than that, going out with the wrong guys is gonna kill your night and make sure you get no pussy.

**Learn to sexually escalate fast**. 

I may write a post on this later, but in countries in the west if you don't sexually escalate especially in a bar/club context, she's gonna think you're a bitch/weird and she's gonna go find a man who knows how to turn her on and fuck her brains out. I know you may be weary of the creep label but as long as you're hyper aware of how comfortable the girl is at all times and paying attention to this while escalating, you won't be creepy. Girls go to places like clubs to either have fun with their friends or to meet hot cool guys that stimulate them. If you meet a girl and get the vibe that she falls into category #2 don't be afraid to move things forward and see if she's into it.

**It's important to have guys around you that like going out and pulling girls.**

Hanging out with only guys that do some video game shit or some other similar activity will make sure you stunt your ability to pull hot women. When I had more friends like ""Alex"" and ""Jerome"" my pull count drastically increased cause these guys would always randomly call me up to hit up some random club or party where there would be cool girls that were down. This shit would never happen if I just chilled at home playing videogames all day and didn't put effort into becoming more attractive both socially and sexually.

**Be a cool wingman.** 

Guys won't call you out with them if they don't feel like they're gonna get more girls by being out with you. If you're a pussy repellent, you'll be like my boy ""Musa"" who we all clown on because he usually fucks our plans up with girls cause he's corny and we know he can't get girls but he's a solid friend of ours. It's okay though we all love our guy Musa!. Oh it sounds superficial? So what? That's how it is. Deal with it. The world isn't here to kiss your sensitive ass.

**My mistake:** I moved things too fast without having any comfort with the girl to make her feel safe/secure. Moving too fast made her feel too slutty so even though I turned her on, she didn't wanna fuck me the same night. The following morning I gave her some comfort and validation so now she liked me more and was down to meet me later on in the week, and since I had already built up sexual tension in the first night I ended up smashing her later.

Know that even though it's good to sexually escalate, you must also add in comfort during this so that she feels safe to be vulnerable around you because you're a stranger she just met and she doesn't wanna feel used for sex.

**You don't have to smash every girl on the first date**

 As long as she's comfortable it's okay to wait till the second or third date if you still have chemistry with her. I personally have 4 dates/meetups as a max to smash a girl. If we don't end up having sex during this time I usually just friendzone/stop pursuing the girl because I know we aren't gonna be compatible.


Hope you guys enjoyed the post and learned a few more things. I'll post more of these if you guys like em. Maybe even stories of me being an idiot and fucking things up for myself so you guys know what not to do lmao. Also I wanted to add: Make sure you get your money up so you can afford stuff like this. The hotel cost around $200 which me and Alex split but including pregame, club entry, shots and Ubers I think I spent around $200-$220 that night and that’s the average cost of a night out for me. If I don’t get a hotel then it’s usually around $50 but if I Uber around then maybe $100*. The worst thing is having girls ready to go back with you but you don’t have money for a hotel room/car ride.

94,I'm FWB with my ex and found out she has a new man,365,v1vdnz,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v1vdnz/im_fwb_with_my_ex_and_found_out_she_has_a_new_man/,153," 

I have to say that this experience has completely black pilled me and made me unable to trust. I'll provide some context.

I dated this woman for 7 years. We broke up because it just wasn't working anymore, no hard feelings. A month later she calls me trying to get back together, I tell her no. She was pleading to be at least friends with benefits so I caved in, and I booked a hotel for us.

We had sex, and afterwards we were sitting on the bed to watch some TV. Mind you at this point I no longer have romantic feelings for her. She is texting someone, I ask who and she says that it's her new boyfriend.

I was completely flabbergasted. I really thought that I knew her, and that she was a good girl, but here she is getting her back blown out when she has a new man. Admittedly, I shouldn't have done this, but I let curiosity get the best of me. When she went to shower I looked through her text messages and it made me feel sick to my stomach.

This guy has been basically worshipping her, telling her she's beautiful 1000 times and on top of that has been paying for her school, gas, and groceries. Mind you they've been dating for 1 and a half months. He sends these long paragraph texts to which she always replies with a few words. He had been trying to get in contact with her for hours, and what was her reasoning? That she was hanging out with friends and couldn't find an outlet to charge her phone. She even sent him a selfie snap right after I banged her, and he has no idea.

The fact that she was able to so nonchalantly lie to him like it was nothing sent shivers down my spine. Especially because I was with her for so long and never thought that she was this type of person. This has given me trust issues that I've never had before. To top it off, we had sex three more times throughout the night during which she complained that his dick isn't as big as mine.

I know it's not fair to base my feelings off one person, but this gives me major trust issues. You would think you know someone after 7 years, but she only just now revealed her true colors to me.

I know that I should tell the new boyfriend, and that it would be the moral thing to do. However, I'm single right now and I'm not going to pass up on commitment free sex, because she'll just end up giving it to someone else, so it might as well be me.",1654017769.0
95,Navigating South Asian Stereotypes Part 1,55,v1vqke,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v1vqke/navigating_south_asian_stereotypes_part_1/,49,"This post is more directed to the South Asians on this sub, and it's a crosspost from a different sub. Also my first post on the Redpill. Never thought I'd post here but here I am lmao. Tamil Dude here to shed some light on stereotypes.

Having negative Stereotypes can absolutely fuck things up for you. Many people talk about South Asian Stereotypes, but what about how to deal with them? That's what this post is for. This post will help you tweak your communication skills so you know how to ""say the right thing"" when you present yourself. Just by breaking these stereotypes you will be seen as way cooler and more attractive.

If you sub-communicate these things while talking to someone, they'll automatically treat you way better and let you get away with more shit whereas if you fall into the stereotype, the experience usually will be a lot worse.

Here's a list+solutions:

**Misogynistic/treats women badly** - This one's a big one. Whether you realize it or not, this stereotype is killing you guys. Especially those of you who like to debate/argue back and forth with women. You being South Asian automatically makes whatever you say seem narcissistic/misogynistic and even if she gets the smallest negative feeling from you, she's gonna think you're some Patriarchy supporting guy. Women are sensitive as fuck. The slightest negative expression on your face or change in voice tone can make her feel uncomfortable. Eliminate this by always being respectful towards women, even if she says something stupid. Never make her feel like she's ""less than"" no matter what she says. Always be cool, and never do something that makes it seem like you think that men deserve more freedom/whatever than women.

**Smelly**- Self explanatory. Shower, use fragrance, and avoid eating smelly foods/spices. Don't smell.

**Takes great care of his appearance/Great physique** - Self Explanatory

**Simp** - Look man idk if its all the Bollywood movies or some bs but Brown guys tend to be simps more than other groups of dudes from what I've seen. These guys overvalue mediocre women and romanticize the shit out of basic relationships and think that every girl they meet is gonna be their wife. Girls are gonna see that and think you're a pussy if you do this shit. Cut it out! The culture doesn't help either. Coming from a culture that has ""dowry"" or ""mehr"" where you're literally expected to pay a woman's family thousands just to marry her is definitely gonna make you pedestalize basic women who would never do the same for you.

**Multi-layered friend groups** - A big subconscious red flag for women is if you only have brown friends. Especially those big fob groups with all dudes speaking some other language all the time. Having more diverse friend groups not only in terms of race, but in terms of appearance/socioeconomic class/age/profession makes it seem like you're a more nuanced person and that you have more life experience and just adds a sense of mystery to you. I have friends of all races, Jacked ass gym bros, scammers, entrepreneurs, club rats/bar hoppers, army boys, drug dealers, drug addicts, religious people, gamers, the whole shebang. Knowing all these people gives me so many stories I can tell and just makes me seem more well rounded in general.

**Privileged** - Show her you put in that work, and that you're mentally/physically skilled to accomplish whatever goal you have in mind due to your incredible competence.

**Prefers long term relationships over short term** - This automatically places you into the ""safe"", bitchboy category which most brown guys like to stumble into. Women usually like a guy who is impulsive and follows his urges. I don't say it directly, but I always present myself as a man who mainly gets with women for fun, instead of some serious formal bs. Too many brown guys are too eager to get into the ""provider"" role. Fuck that. Be able to provide, but only for the woman you're gonna marry and grow old with. I wrote a post on this you can see on my profile called ""Emphasizing the Physical Connection""

**Emotional** - For this one, the problem is that Desis are too straightforward, so if a Desi is mad, you can easily tell. Non desis are really good at hiding this shit, so they seem calm. Another thing is that Desis are too naive and trust in the good nature of others, so they think they can share their emotions/vulnerability freely, but this will just make you seem like a bitch. Don't do it. Learn to be more Disingenuous

**Parent's bitch** - This one is terrible. Make it seem like you aren't that close to your parents, or that you just don't respect their authority, but you're still kind to them. You're more of a person who does their own thing.

**Shames others** - Never ever ever shame someone else especially if it's a woman. Always let them do whatever tf they want. Don't feel like you have to ""uphold the tradition"" or some bs. It's just gonna make you look bad. Always make an effort to seem non-judgemental

**Narrow career path** - Even if all you wanna do is to be an engineer, and nothing else, still mention other non-academic goals that you wanna achieve/do. Tell people how you wanna go travel to some place and start over, or how you plan on joining some band or start making beats.

**Only dates women from his own culture** - Make it seem like you don't really have a racial preference and that you're open to all. You'd be surprised at the amount of hot white/black/asian girls who will hide their attraction to you because they think you only date brown girls or only take brown girls as a serious option. Be careful of how you word this though, or else you're gonna get cancelled for having a ""fetish"" for white/black/asian women.

**Non-Confrontational** - Develop a liking towards getting in confrontations/aggressive situations where things can escalate. Be mindful of where you do this though, you don't wanna end up dead, but always make sure you gain your respect.

**Religious** - It's especially the Muslim guys who will have a harder time on this one. Most non-desi girls no matter what they say about being ""open minded"", they don't wanna deal with some hardcore religious bs so just make it seem like you believe in a higher power/spirituality but you don't really practice religion. However, if you're a beast you could try to get her into religion as well it's up to you but its a fools errand.

**Nerdy** - This shit's quite obvious man, but it seems like a lotta guys haven't got the memo. Hot girls usually don't like that nerd shit man. So cut it out. All those nerd hobbies you got like video games, anime, certain books etc will just make you seem like a child from a woman's POV. They might be more forgiving about these things for a relationship, but for short term dating? Hell nah they usually want a stud. As a brown guy, being a nerd is even worse because women don't have any Hypermasculine Desi images in their head to counteract your childish Nerdiness. So I'd suggest completely getting rid of these hobbies and getting new ones or just don't show this side of yourself to the woman until you know she'll be cool with it.

Even when getting to know her, show her the more artsy/edgy side of yourself like how you like to travel/make music/hit the gym/cook/go clubbing etc rather than tell her about your boring endeavor of getting your degree in college.

And before we go any further. Please remember to not get gaslighted by those Desi ""uncles"" or fake woke people who try to act as if South Asian Stereotypes are just harmless, but they'll go post and cry all day about Asian/Black people's stereotypes and how ""things must change"".

All the stuff I mentioned above is like how when you're around some white people they'll do the weirdest shit to make it seem like they're not racist. Or some latino/black people will try their best to make it seem like they're not hood/ghetto so they'll say ""oh I actually don't really like basketball, and rap isn't my thing, I looooove reading books"". These are the people who never ever ever wear Jordans/streetwear, and usually dress more preppy and speak in excellent grammar because they don't wanna seem uneducated because they know that negative ghetto stereotype will fuck their image up and lead to them getting treated badly due to ignorance/false assumptions. Well this post included the South Asian version of that because you never really see this stuff discussed.

The post was getting too long so I might add another part. What are some other Desi stereotypes that you guys see? Most brown guys who do well are either consciously or unconsciously Navigating through these stereotypes, and since you are now aware of them, it will only serve to help you in your game.

Disclaimer While doing these things, it should never come across as if you're doing these things as an attempt to ""change brown stereotypes"". You should treat these things as an extension of your personality and show that ""this is how I really truly am"".

If you liked this post, join us over at the SouthAsianMasculinity subreddit which is small, but growing. We had moderation issues in the past but we're working on fixing it and having more brown guys join and post their experiences.

96,"2 years later, She made no improvement.",0,v30esj,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/v30esj/2_years_later_she_made_no_improvement/,48,"Background:

About 2 years ago I met Cindy(f23) on tinder and we hit it off.She was somewhat pretty.I didn't see any red flags and we did had a great first date. On the second date, I took her to my apartment where we flirted and things were leading to sex, we didn't but damn we were so close.She said she wasn't ready and I respected it and so instead we went out for some drinks. Now here's the thing, admidst the sexual foreplay before we went out, she did mention she was only looking for friends but it honestly sly through my ears (I thought it was just a playful test).

On the fourth date she finally drop the bomb and I realize she wasn't playing when she said it (Mind you, we have kiss a lot, had a third date, we were even more sexual and I have spend a lot of damn money). My mind snap back into reality because I was LEAD ON .I look at her and said that I wasn't looking for friends. She insisted to be friends because she loved the dates and the time we spend together. What I said next completely shook her! 

""When a woman wants to be friends, (especially WITH WHAT WE WENT THROUGH)  it's because she wants to keep you as a backup plan, or orbitor while she goes and explore other options"". 

I'm telling you, the moment I told her that sh!t, her world came crashing down, as if though no man has ever put her in her place. Her eyes opened wide, her jaw dropped a little and was left speechless for a minute without any rebuttal. I had one of those HAA....GOT YA  moments .From this impression alone, I've reliaze no man has ever challenge her and that most men might have be probably too nice. Again, she insisted we be friends which I responded that I have enough friends. For a third time, she insisted that we are better off as friends. I saw that there would be no end to this chat and that she couldn't understand my point of view. I finally agree to be friends, and said ""Okay sure"". When I drop her off, I shake her hand and thank her for the great time we had. I genuinely enjoy it and smile🙂.

When I reach home, I was so fckng angry😡🤬. I dispise her, the time and all the money I spend. I was so stupid and too infatuated with her.I even deleted tinder and had a little drink.

She texted me later that night and wanted to chat, I kept it short, friendly and agreeable.After seeing my non-enthusiastic and plantonic responses, She ask me if this was it? I said to her no but in my mind it was.As days pass, I never initiated contact and she eventually stop contacting me.Those weeks were bad but as time passed, I begot to heal .And I've realize I made the right decision because I rather leave than to be her good friend and see her being fck by other men. 

Thoughtout the 2 years, I kept her in my socials and I usually see her updates. She has always posted half nude pictures with most showing breast cover by her hair. And just recently, I've reliaze it's actually very sad because I've purchase 3 lands during this time. And I am LITERALLY LITERALLY seeing how her looks are deteriorating. On the other hand, Im planning to build some rental property after I finish paid off 6k in loans. It's little and yes I've lost my job but fck it. I'll be rich one day and my total net value will be well over 1 millon. And what does this chick have? Only her looks. she didn't even do something great or got some degree. I mean, there's nothing wrong with posting pics but all her pics are self center and attention seeking.It's that's the only thing you have going for yourself? I ask. what will happen when your looks begins to fade? At what age will you realize, you need to get her sht together? And to said i was really infatuated with you. Now I only see a shallow individual.",1654143060.0

Was messing around with this chick off an app and she was pretty clingy and would invite me out to parties/bards/clubs constantly. Sometimes I went, most times I didn't. One night she drunk called me practically begging me to go out to this bar with her and I told her no. She responded with ""oh, so you want me to make out with another guy or something"". I hung up, stopped answering her calls that night, and then she called me early in the am begging for forgiveness. She was just a little distraction from med school, so I didn't lose any sleep over it.

However, I also wanted to try out some different game and I started running hard dreadgame and keeping a stone-cold frame. I noticed a massive difference in her behavior trying to increase her value to me -- she would start saying things like ""I don't give my number out often"". Sometimes I would purposely leave my phone up (I usually put it front-side down for privacy), so she could see the message notifications I would get from other girls.

I also started to give her small details about my life and she ate that shit up and wanted more. She was addicted. She would drop everything she was doing to make herself available to me, when I was only half-interested during our time together anyways.

Just wanted to post this because it seems like a lot of guys (even on TRP) underestimate playing the psych game, and many females use it to control and manipulate men.",1653882604.0

- If they say “No worries” or anything like that. Then you still good.

- If “Oh I almost forgot” then they have 1 hour to get ready and you can recalibrate the situation. 

-If “Oh sorry can’t make it today” then you at least don’t have to go through the hassle to get ready and it’s up to you if you want to reschedule or they can reschedule.

The man's dual mating strategy has a primary strategy of finding quality woman or handful of women to give his parental, provisional, protectional and associative status to as his wife (read: parenting partner), if she is high enough quality. Then his secondary strategy is to just have as much random sex with as large of a variety of women as he can that he puts no investment into

The woman's dual mating strategy has a secondary strategy to find a quality man to have children with (good genetics) and attempt to get his commitment, at least enough to be one of his partners he puts parental, provisional, protectional and associative status into.

However, that is statistically unlikely to happen. A woman's primary sexual strategy is to use one man for his genetics, then use another man for his provisioning.

This is why the female to male reproductive ratio is 17:1 during the last 8000 years (according to geneticists) even though we're also a pairboding species. (  In more recent history, as a global average, about four or five women reproduced for every one man. ) [Source](https://psmag.com/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success)

It's also why women show more attraction to high testosterone indicating males (thick jaw lines) while they are ovulating, and lower testosterone indicating males (thin jaw line) when they are not.

Women evolved this way, because it is both a personally beneficial adaptation but more importantly, it was beneficial for the species as a whole. The strong/smart got to breed more, the weak got to breed less, while all children get provisioning, protection and parental investment from at least one man.

Men and women cheating (if they can) are just following their biological drives, even though they are counter-productive to social stability and familial stability. Without a framework to deter human behavior (religion, wisdom, ethics, laws) we fall back on our animalistic defaults.

All you can do is keep women at arm's length as much as possible, to keep their behavior as good as possible.",1653615800.0

If you are not confident.  You are not ready to get the girl  If you're afraid of losing the girl, you're not ready to get the girl.  Think abundance and non-attachment.

&#x200B;

Anyone that reads the forums has seen certain people post about approaching and being masculine and that's 100% correct. Out of all the forms of seduction there's something intrinsically better about a face to face interaction.

Pick up in person is also great at building instant attraction and striking while the iron is hot instead of being a cute guy in a sea of dicks. I'd say that it opens up your odds.

So, that said I figured I'd go out and work out that seduction skill.

I'll give you a breakdown of what just happened less than an hour ago while most of the details are still fresh in my head, go over what I did and why and hope that you learn something.

I'll then link a video of a good interaction between a woman and a man and break that down.

This is for those that may struggle or just need an edge.

If you think you can do better then go for it. If you think this is fiction then you'll need to go out more. If you're going to <insert excuse> to validate some bleak nihilistic Blackpill outlook then get the fuck out. You're not here to learn. 

&#x200B;

Let's begin.

&#x200B;

There's a bar not too far away from where I live. A slight hole in the wall that's near enough to a school to draw in the younger crowds as well as quaint enough to have a hipster vibe that draws in the older crowd.  They've also had a new roster of waitresses and bartenders added sooo...

Great place to meet women.

Keeping it light, I dressed up with clean white Converse, white T-shirt, faded light jeans that are form fitting, black jean jacket, leather belt, white baseball cap and a nice watch and sunglasses. Nothing fancy. Worked out, showered, and cologne.

For the shirt, I always go with something form fitting. 

Women love anything that shows off the body because *-drumroll-* women like nice things. Fucking crazy huh?

So, this goes back to getting fit 101. You don't need to look like  Alan Ritchson (Reacher) but at least look like your breakfast isn't a tray of Cinnabon.

Got in, smile and make eye contact with the staff, head high, back straight, act as if you're co owner.

Body language.

Head over to the bar, take your time. Again. Body language.

*Bartender: ""Skew! How are you? Do you want the usual?""*

Honestly. Your drink doesn't matter. What impresses women is being decisive and knowing what you want then telling it instead of asking. 

Practice banter.

*Skew: ""You're just trying to get me drunk so you can have your way with me.""*

I joke around. You don't have to, but I think it helps.

*Bartender: \*smiles\* ""Behave!""*

*Skew: Rum and Coke. Double. Tall. Spiced. Order of pork skewers.*

The next bit is honestly just inane banter. While I'm talking to her, I'm periodically watching TV, making \*eye contact with the people around, and I notice a waitress check me out.

So, I'll pause right here.

When a woman checks you out. She does one of two things. She looks at you then takes looking at something else then looks back at you OR she looks at you and stares for a few moments.

Former is just noticing something she likes and the latter is when you're really higher value. 

I didn't get the latter but I can tell she was at least enjoying what she was seeing.

Keep that in mind.

Let's continue.

So, I make an order. Bartender leaves and gives me a hug. 2nd bartender takes over. All filler. Now the good part.

*Skew: ""I'll pay my bill.""*

*2nd Bartender: Sure.* 

*Waitress that was looking at me: I'll ring him out.*

*2nd Bartender walks out and the waitress goes to process my order.*

*Waitress: You don't need to pay for the drink. Just the meal.*

*Skew: Oh?*

*Waitress: Yea, I took care of it already. \*Smile\**

Let's recap.

Checking me out. **Check**.

Covers my drink. **Check**.

Eyes. Dilated like a cat on oxy. **Check**.

Body language: Feet pointing towards me, mirroring my movement, moving hair back. 

**That's more than 3 IOIs. Easy close.**

Let's play.

*Skew:  What's the occasion? Don't give off a homeless vibe do I?*

*Her: \*Mild concern\* No, just heard you were a nice guy.*

Women talk. If you date/bang one then that spreads. This bar is close to my house so I've gone on a few dates here and I've also made a habit of picking up some of the more attractive patrons here so yea...let's continue.

*Skew: I don't know who's lying to you but I'm not complaining. Your new. What's your name?*

**Compliance test 1: Also, when you're treated like you're attractive don't back down. Act as if that's common because it re-enforces that behavior.**

*Her: <Random generic name>*

*Skew: Well, <generic name>  that sweet gesture put you on my top 10 list of favorite waitresses. Come here. \*extend for a hug\**

**Compliance test 2: Also, now we're in Kino with touching and her giving me permission to the set that expectation going forward.**

Skew gets a hug. I smile and tell her to sit down for a moment and keep me company before I go.

**Compliance test 3: \^**

*Her:  I can't stay long because I'm the only one working the patio.* 

*Skew: Don't worry about it.  Your still new. Tell your boss you're dealing with a difficult customer.* 

**IDGAF attitude. Insert shit eating grin.**

*Skew: Long day?*

*Her: Yea, I don't do the sun too well. \*Shows me her skin with a slight sunburn\**

**TIP: Anytime a woman shows you any part of her body that's an IOI. The proper response is to touch and KINO but your boy Skew has got a bit rusty (thanks C0v1d) and didn't catch that until the window passed.**

*Skew: I've seen worse. Let me guess, you've got some Irish in you.*

*Her: Good guess!  I'm mixed Irish and Metis.*

*Skew: So, that means that you'd either drink me under the table or be out after a beer. Fucking hell of a wager for a date.*

**Making this into a man/woman interaction. Also putting the notion of asking her out in her head. I'm a man. She's a woman. You get the idea.**

She laughs but I can tell this is starting to drag a bit. Be mindful of the environment.  She still has an obligation to her job and she's new. When a woman is in a hurry or doing something, try to make the interaction last less than a minute. The easier it is for her the easier she'll be for you.

*Skew: Let's find out. Give me your number and next time we're free we can  discuss which of us has the better mix. Pretty sure I've got you beat.*

*Her: What's yours?*

*Skew: Guess you'll have to find out.*

She writes her number. Get another hug and peace out.

&#x200B;

That's pretty much a play by play. Yea, it's not the best but fuck it. Still something.

I know where I fucked up and where I could've pushed it further. There are some things that I'm sure some detractors are going to point out:

\- She was already into you.

\- You didn't really cold approach since she already knew of you.

\- She was just being nice since you're a familiar to the bar.

\- You're probably handsome, tall, muscular, equipped with a horse sized cock, etc.

&#x200B;

To which I will respond in order:

So what? Yep. Happens in new bars too.  Probably.

&#x200B;

To the unexperienced, this sounds too good to be true, but to the guys who go out there and approach this is the reality. There's nothing exceptional about this. She was cute but I wouldn't say hot, at least not to my standards, so I don't think of this as an achievement and more as a tool to teach guys who may be struggling how my thought process was.

I **STRONGLY** encourage you guys to get out there and try this stuff out and write your own FR.

&#x200B;

*\*Shoutout to Radio for those drills. Otherwise, I wouldn't  know that you can look at people.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Part 2**

&#x200B;

This part is for those guys who need to see an interaction live. 

&#x200B;

For Context. 

I stumbled onto this awhile back. This has been actress (?) goes on dates with guys and then tries to rattle them. She gives off a vibe of a woman who is well is sporting a high ego, brings nothing to the table, and believes she's got her choice at the table. 

So, in short, a typical woman.

&#x200B;

The video is less about pick up and more about interacting with a woman on a date or just when you're out and about. Generally, with a few minor points, I think he's exceptionally quick witted and executed everything near perfect. 

The accent and style aren't too much of my taste and his humor is coming across a bit too strong, but overall, I think the guy's on point.

&#x200B;

[Here's the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WopcdI-DPH8&t=17s&ab_channel=StandOutTV)

&#x200B;

I tried to breakdown the video but there's so much gold in regards to his responses, her tests, how he behaves, and her body language that it would take too long for me to comment and I've already wrote enough for the night.

So, if you guys want to breakdown his play and share what your take away from the video are then be my guests.

&#x200B;

If there's value in this then maybe I'll do more of this stuff. No skin off my back either way.",1653372247.0
103,Age Demographics of Failing Societies,201,uvhzjo,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/uvhzjo/age_demographics_of_failing_societies/,112,"Age demographics. I’ve been cooking up a post on this topic for a while, since this has been a topic of interest to me after reading ‘The Misandry Bubble’ back in 2017. The economic and social impact of an aging society/civilization is very interesting. 

‘The Misandry Bubble’ was written in 2010 and predictions made in it continue to play out. One of the main conclusions from the piece, which goes back to the ‘Bubble’ part of the title, is that there will not be enough tax dollars to prop up feminism/social programs that have replaced marriage. An aging population only exacerbates and accelerates government deficits.

To quote Elon Musk: ‘Population collapse is potentially the greatest risk to the future of civilization’. Recently, he tweeted that Japan might cease to exist if birthrates keep decreasing. Which seems to be a universal feature in prosperous and emancipated societies. Why is an aging society with a lacking number of newborns a big issue? There is something called the ‘Dependency ratio’. This ratio is officially calculated as following: (Children age 0-14 + elderly age 65 and up) divided by the labor force age 15 to 64.

Generally speaking, the lower this number the better, as it means there are many productive people who can support the ‘dependent’ portion of a society. When this number is high, an economy tends to grow the fastest, as there is little drag in terms of deadweight it has to carry. 

Many countries in Africa tend to have a high dependency ratio because they have a lot of kids between age 0-14. There are not enough parents to properly raise & support all these kids > they die young > which is why there are not enough parents (super simplistic). It’s a very nasty cycle to be trapped in, but not what this post is about. Western countries have an entirely different problem. Elderly. It’s also a fairly new problem, as the average life expectancy was barely 50 years before the 20th century. People didn’t reach retirement age, let alone live for 20+ years on average after being retired.

I looked at publicly available age demographic data from 2001, 2021 and 2041 in The Netherlands, however our demography is fairly similar to those of other western countries liberated after WWII. Furthermore, I tweaked the definition of the dependency ratio a little, because I don’t think the official definition is accurate in developed nations.

For 2001, I used age 0-19 as ‘dependent’ children, 20-64 as ‘labor force’ and 65+ as elderly.

For 2021, 0-20, 21-66, 67+

For 2041, 0-21, 22-68, 69+

The reason I made this adjustment is that nobody is a contributing member of society from 14 years old. Maybe in Third World countries. In western countries, some people start working full time in their late teens, others only after completing a master’s degree in their mid 20s. There is a trend for people to stay in school longer and start working later, as our society continues to complexify, which is why I added 1 year of extra education per 2 decades. 

I also extended the labor force bracket by 1 year per decade, as delayed retirement age is a continuing trend.

Some key statistics:

|| Year |2001|2021|2041|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|People x1,000| Elderly |2,172|3,040 |4,046|
|| Working  |9,907|10,462|10,741|
|| Children |3,908|3,966|4,524|

**From 2001 to 2041, the amount of elderly in The Netherlands will increase by a whopping 86%** **while the working age population will grow by just 8.4%.** Currently, my country has 40% more elderly compared to 2001.

&#x200B;

||  Year|2001|2021|2041|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|People x1,000|  Dependent:|6,080|7,006 |8,570|
|| Working: |9,907|10,462|10,741 |
|| Ratio |0,614|0,670|0,798|

For every 100 people in the labor force, there were 61 dependents in 2001.

In 2041, the same 100 people will have to support 80 others instead.

That is a 31% increase. 

This is NOT taking into account part-time workers, unemployment, disability etc. If this is taken into account, the dependency ratio will be around 1:1 in 2041. Imagine the burden and pressure of this on the social system etc. 

In my view, a society that’s in this kind of decline is a breeding ground for populism, chaos and possibly revolution. Elderly will complain about inflation and that their pensions are not high enough. Young people will be paying high taxes to support an older generation that has accumulated and owns most of the wealth already, and real estate is expensive. Since the 50s, a large part of our labor shortage has been fixed with immigration, which furthers tensions and division. Combine this with the inflation we are currently seeing and energy crisis in the EU (CPI will average 4-6% this decade, it will not end soon. Sometimes it will be 2%, sometimes it will be 12%). Asset inflation will be much worse, as the current rate hikes are still far below what ‘real’ market interest rates would look like were it not for central bank interference.

Germany is shutting down nuclear plants while trying to become independent of Russian energy. We live in a clown world. 

Become rich and get multiple passports. Don’t live off the grid, live on multiple grids. Western societies are slowly failing, prepare an escape route. You might never have to use it, but it’s better to have something you don’t need than to need something you don’t have.",1653247079.0
104,Do you love women? (Better than Pook),136,uv9atl,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/uv9atl/do_you_love_women_better_than_pook/,65,"Silly question, I know.

But over the weekend, this past weekend, I met a guy who wanted to ""game"" with me at the club/bar I frequent and he told me to read this book, [The Alabaster Girl](https://usa1lib.org/book/4969389/ccfeb4), so the next morning, while sitting at the Whole Foods on Lamar and 5th on this hot pre-summer day, I cracked open the e-book and got to reading. And reading. And reading. And all I did that day besides eat and piss was read that book. The last time I was so captivated and sort of... shaken at the core by a book - truly a joy in life - was probably when I first found *The Book of Pook*. 

Of course, I encourage you read it yourself, anon, but the entire premise of the book is essentially this: ""***I have no method. My entire seduction stems from my sincere and shameless love of women. I simply love women more than anything in the world, including any one woman, and I express my appreciation for their beauty directly, without presumption, without any need from them to contribute anything to an interaction, and I invite them into my life.***""

Last night, I was up until 3 A.M. or so - an awful habit - watching the movie [The Invention Of Lying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6qN4JdylXM) because I am truly fascinated by Louis C.K. and, upon waking this morning, I wondered to myself, ""why did I do that?"" and usually my answer would be that I was being a degenerate who was wasting his time in frivolous pleasures but, this time, I realized that it was because I am constantly, constantly thinking about this part of my life - success with women. I think of it from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. I think of it as I watch [Blade Runner 2049](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfrgOB_Mp1Y) and as I watch *The Invention Of Lying*. 

And the significance of this obsession circles back to the question: *do you love women*? I couldn't help but laugh at the sheer simplicity of this book's premise... and the fact that it truly did shake me - the fact that I never really got down to this so central of a question: [do you love women?](https://www.instagram.com/cindymello/) The author of [The Alabaster Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPeVcuDQ_bE), Zan Perrion, loves women more than anything in the world. He loves the beauty in all women and looks for it. What more is there to life than appreciating and creating beauty? What more truly drives and moves a spirit than the beauty of a painting or [a concerto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhQAtkXOK6o) or a woman?

In fact, my whole journey in self-development began because I saw the most beautiful girl I had ever seen in my entire life in that little two story cafe restaurant on the edge of Aix-En-Provence. I don't even remember her name but the magnitude of her beauty so moved me that I went from a shit head high school student to an lofty-dreamed aspirational adult.

   [Philosophy is truly about asking the right questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOKlqdP8e14&t=30s) and this book hits the motherload. The entire ""struggle"" of ""game"" and dating and success with women dissipates... all of it evaporates once you accept and champion your true and honest love for women - all of them - and the beauty that they embody. This does not mean that you must sleep with every single woman in the world. It only means that you are not afraid to express your appreciation and desire for them at any moment. That appreciation can be expressed as a compliment, a glance, a smile, a nod, a wave, a kiss, a dance, a conversation, a joke, a holding of hands, a share of laughter, or sex. Because your love for women is so true, because your love for women is so real and shameless and honest and vulnerable... you will no longer be afraid to express your appreciation and desire for her because... well... you love her... both superficially and metaphysically. Women are the ultimate embodiments of [beauty on Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxHkLdQy5f0).

This, unfortunately, is a topic undiscussed in *The Book of Pook*. I have read *The Book of Pook* many many times and the only mention of a love for women is in the context of desperation. I take that back. In one of his posts, he mentions that successful people love what they do so that working very hard for them is easy because it doesn't seem like work. Bingo.

When I am out and in my flow state, I have so much of a love for life and women and all people and I believe truly that that is why my game comes out so strong. It is not because I get in the pocket of my verbal proficiency or what have you. It is because I find my appreciation and love for action and women and walking and talking and eye contact and music and every single aspect of the world around me. So a lesson to take is to actively search for that love even when your mind defaults to pessimism, to judgment, to coping mechanisms. There is beauty in everyone but you must be willing to see it and champion it. This does not mean that you have to fuck every woman you come across, but it does mean that you do not have to hold back your metaphysical, masculine love for the beauty in the women of the world. That's what women are for. To be emissaries of beauty.

This question is the ultimate simplifier, the great leveler, the last piece of the puzzle that flips the entire board upside down: [do you love women?](https://www.instagram.com/adrianalima/) It all comes down to this. 

And now, I must reconsider my whole life which I was dedicating to this area of my life when truly it was just a matter of whether or not you truly loved women or not? It all flows from this standpoint. If you don't love women, then you will be confused as to why you are talking to them, why you are trying to seduce them, why you would even touch them. If you do not love women, then your motivation is off, impure, and beautiful women will see it. You are using your ego to motivate you rather than your soul which is a wellspring of love.

I am reminded of some of my greatest moments: the Peruvian Mia at the Bungalow in Santa Monica back in August. Another Mia I met here in Texas. The Italian beauty I met in Miami. The girls I met at the mall back in California when I was 17. The Asian girl I spontaneously spent a couple hours with at Moorpark College. I am sure there are more but my point is this: love is the ultimate motivation and if you can tap into it, all of your problems go away. If you want something, find the love for it and champion it with authenticity. [You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It is the only good fight there is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTRPLQKtzOY)

I think, after I read this book, it is time I stop searching. I think, after I read this book, it is time that I go live my life. I think I ought to burn my library.

105,You Deserve to Be Here,186,utksf3,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/utksf3/you_deserve_to_be_here/,37," Hey you.

I’m directly talking to YOU.

You probably feel like you don’t deserve to be here, like other guys in this community are *better* than, further ahead that you, more *special* than you, *cooler* than you.

2 mates of mine (who everyone else would say is elite) told me, one after the other, 2 days apart, that they don’t feel like they deserve to be in the communities they are in, full of other go getters.

One in particular even said he’s jealous of the other guy and compares himself to that guy all the time – and then that other guy told me 2 days later that he feels like a massive fraud who doesn’t belong.

I told one of them all of this and he said, *“I’m so insecure I never woulda guessed people look up to me.""*

It’s a great point – I’m insecure about a million things. Of course I am, I’m human. I’m not perfect.

I've seen and heard a tonne of guys say they're insecure and don’t feel like they belong, that they're not cool enough to be trying to get laid. I’ve lost count of the number of guys that feel like you don’t belong in the group of “guys who get laid” or “guys who are improving their finances” or “guys who are losing weight” or just generally “guys who are working on improving themselves”

I’ll tell you right now, cool has nothing to do with it. “Good enough” has nothing to do with it. “Deserve” has nothing to do with it. Success is EARNED, it is not deserved. If you want success, if you want to reach your goals, it doesn’t matter whether you’re good enough or cool enough or deserve it – in fact, you WON’T be good enough at the start.

You haven’t EARNED it yet.

All that matters is you keep pushing forward, keep striving for more, and never ever quit.

A couple of years ago when I was a bit more of a newbie, I always felt like I didn’t belong. Like I wasn’t good enough. Even when having my first 3some, I literally felt like I *still* didn’t belong on subs like this… like it was just a “fluke” and I’d “gotten lucky” and sooner or later they’d all find out I was actually a loser. I didn’t feel like I could ever be a player.

I didn’t feel like I could ever be cool enough.

The same thing with my finances – I’d always been in debt. I never felt like I deserved *not* to be in debt. Even when I got to a point where I could go full-time with my business, I felt like I was an imposter. A fraud. Like I’d just gotten “lucky”, whatever the fuck that means.

News flash, most people who succeed feel like “I just got lucky” for a long time, until they finally internalise “No I EARNED this”. But that takes time; often months, sometimes years. It’s so normal, so common, to feel like an imposter and a fraud even after you succeed at something. But I promise you that fades eventually and you realise, “I worked hard to get here. It wasn’t luck. It was hard work, a stubborn refusal to ever quit, and just taking tiny little baby steps towards my goal every day. I deserve to be here.”

I’m talking to all of you.

You fucking deserve to be here.

You’re so much better than the average guy.

You care enough to fix your issues.

You’re aware of your flaws and you’re actively working on them.

You have the courage to admit you want something more from life, you don’t want to be complacent.

You’re terrified of getting to the end of your life and having regrets, and you’re brave enough to face that fear and do something to prevent it from happening.

You’re terrified of being average. You’re terrified of not being good enough. You’re here addressing that fear, learning, taking action, working on yourself. You’ve run from average and run towards something greater; you’ve sought out other people who want to be better too.

I know when you’re so acutely aware of all your flaws, all your insecurities, all the reasons you aren’t good enough, it’s very easy to feel like you don’t belong.

It’s very easy to feel like you’re an imposter.

It’s very easy to feel like other guys are better than you, that you’re on your own, that they’re all in a club together and you’re an outsider. That you’re not the cool kid and you can never be with the other cool kids.

But that isn’t the case. We all felt like losers at the start.

I felt like the world’s biggest loser, for YEARS I felt like I didn’t belong and shouldn’t be here.

But even with all my insecurities, fears and doubts, I still made it. Even the loser called Andy was able to make it, despite never believing he deserved to.

And if I can do it, **you sure as hell can too.**",1653018936.0
106,The Most Chivalrous Thing You Can Do For American Women Is Anal,304,uqy0hg,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/uqy0hg/the_most_chivalrous_thing_you_can_do_for_american/,71,"If you've been following the illustrious career of Red Pill Superstar GayLubeOil, you would know that some of his greatest masterpieces have been censored by people too dimwitted to comprehend their brilliance. “American Women Want to Be Choked and Spanked Because Subconsciously They Know They Are Responsible for The Downfall of Western Civilization” was a profound synthesis of Freudian Psychoanalysis and Oswald Spangler's theory that all civilizations are subject to an inevitable process of growth and decay. My latest masterpiece “How to Use the Desperation of Ukrainian War Refugees to Your Sexual Advantage” was scrubbed off the internet because people failed to understand it as an invitation for us, the humble readers of the Red Pill, to do the right thing and house persons displaced by war. The deletion of my work is on par with the desecration of the Library of Alexandria which is why I shed a tear for you, the humble reader of the Red Pill, for all of my masterpieces that were snatched out of your eager grasp.

While I do not have the power to restore what was destroyed, I can, however, make an attempt to convince my critics of my profound appreciation of women, which is why I, Women Appreciator GayLubeOil, have explicitly written this moral and ethical sexual strategy guide: The Most Chivalrous Thing You Can Do For American Women Is Anal.

**Providing Anal Sex Is The Best Way To Protect Women From Committing Abortion:**

At first glance, the concept may seem counterintuitive. What part of stretching out a woman's brown starfish is chivalrous? The part where she doesn't kill your child afterwards. The part where she doesn't go to Planned Parenthood, have forceps inserted up through her vagina up into her uterus and have your child decapitated inside her. American women are too irresponsible to be trusted with vaginal sex as ¼ will have an abortion in their lifetime. 

If we, chivalrous gentlemen of The Red Pill, have to accept the risk of plunging into a dark pungent abyss to save women from a most abominable sin, then that's a sacrifice I say we make. The noble thing is to shoot in her poop shoot. It is up to us noble knights to control ourselves as they lack the self-discipline to follow in our heavy footsteps.

**Be a Bare Back Benefactor Not a Condom Contaminator**

Now at this point some of you are no doubt repeating dangerous condom lobby propaganda: Don't Be Silly Wrap Your Willy. I shake my head in disgust of your Blue Pill ignorance. You really think that I, Woman Respecter GayLubeOil, will stand idly by as you contaminate beautiful, strong, independent women with microplastic? You think I'm going to say nothing as you slip your cock into a petrochemical Xenoestrogen death trap? Oh, and maybe you thought I forgot about the sea turtles 🐢 which are literally choking on condoms because of people like you. People like you disgust me. Condoms are both an endocrine and environmental hazard which is why the ethical choice is to forego their use. Be a bare back benefactor, not a condom contaminator.

**Chemical Castration Is No Way to Treat a Lady**

A Red Pill Alpha's time is best spent ramming females with his meaty situation, not wasting it on their consolation. Oral contraceptives induce tryptophan oxygenase causing a pyridoxine deficiency which is a slippery slope down Depression Drive. Poor dopamine signaling and low GABA cause a lack of joy, low excitement, no fun, and anhedonia. High prolactin and low testosterone cause a lack of libido and its motivating/creative surpluses. High estrogen causes aggressive, impotent incel-rage, moodiness and manic-depression. Poor metabolism contributes to weight gain and leads to chronic coping behaviors like eating disorders, indecision and low stress tolerance.

65% of fertile females are chemically castrating themselves with oral contraceptive tricking their body into feeling like its suffering an endless stream of miscarriages and making themselves miserable in the process.

If they were healthy, they would be moaning with pleasure about you in their treasure. Instead of screaming your name they're gaining weight while complaining about migraine pain. Oral contraceptives are oral steroids and unlike the good steroids that make men jacked, horny and aggressive they make women sleepy, fat and sexually apathetic. If the last couple years have shown us anything, it's that modern medicine cares about money, not health outcomes. Don't let them chemically castrate your fun fertile female into a frumpster grumpster who you'll inevitably have to throw into the dumpster.

**Treat Her Like a Pirate and Get in Her Booty** 

Do your duty. Swap her Pill for your Red Pill by flipping her over and turning her frown upside down with a little bit of brown. You not infiltrating her backdoor corridor is an endless stream of “I told you so.” Remember who you are. You're a Red Pill Alpha fighting on behalf of the unborn, sea turtles and female endocrinology. Be proud of that as you spread her wide and slip in through the backside.

107,Field Report: Spontaneity’s Frustration,43,uqlavh,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/uqlavh/field_report_spontaneitys_frustration/,29,"So, another field report for y’all. History with this one dates back to when I (M19 then, now 21) acquire presidency of a uni society. She’s (age unknown, never told me, ballpark 7 years older) studying for a doctorate in psychology. Has a veritable army of simps chasing her at all times as a classic blonde pale model look.

We go on one date in my second year, nothing comes of it. I filter her into my archive, move on with my life.

Bump into each other at an event in my 3rd year towards the end of the 2nd term. Get to talking, one thing leads to another, we head to a coffee house, back to mine. Proceeds to happen a few more times over the course of that term and once when I get back.

After I get back for my final term (after our last hookup) it turns into more of a frustration. Decreasing interest, distant at social events, there was an anonymous submission to our uni message board in her style talking about keeping distance to avoid getting hurt. Lecturing myself about assuming this could have ever been her, but I’ll forgive myself the irrationality given that I was starting to feel protective. 

After 2 weeks of near silence I call it dead in the water and seek her out for an answer. I get the classic ‘it’s not you it’s me’ and ‘wrong time right person’ lines OWTTE. She keeps going on about how she wants things to be spontaneous, she kept seeing other guys, she doesn’t want any expectations etc, all predictable uni behaviour. She’d also diagnosed me with ASD, lmao, ok. Probably, but even if so, idc. 

I walk away after one last kiss unsatisfied with the explanation telling her I’m not gonna waste my time. I knew asking would kill the attraction but she said I didn’t do anything wrong, so on the chance it’s true, I’ll take that as a medal and watch her leave. Not sure how much else there is to learn here other than that people make irrational decisions (which can be uniquely frustrating if you think you’ve not made any obvious/unrecoverable mistake and are used to thinking logically) and it’s good to detach yourself from that. The only gap for me is in figuring out how; would be good to get the communities’ thoughts.",1652667187.0
108,How To Start Cold Approaching Women Even Though You're Paralyzed In Fear Of Rejection,209,up4mj8,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/up4mj8/how_to_start_cold_approaching_women_even_though/,34,"Let's put all of our bullshit to the side about not approaching women.  No, you're not too busy because it only takes about 30  seconds or less to see if a woman is willing or unwilling to get with you.  No, lifting weights and working out is not an excuse because you always have rest days.  No, paying for sex is not an excuse because deep down inside  you would rather have the power to get women that have genuine desire for you and not fucking you because you paid her to.  These are just a few excuses that men will say to make themselves seem like they're putting off women to do something that's more important than women.  Just be honest with yourself and say,

""I would love to have the power to talk to women without the fear of rejection, but I'm too fearful of rejection""

If you treat cold approach like a confidence ""bench press"" you will see the value it brings to your personal development.

""How is getting rejected gonna increase my confidence?""

Some men ""approach"" cold approaching like playing a championship game.  I like to treat cold approach as hitting the gym, practicing your jump shot, practicing with a dance partner, or hitting a PR on a lift.

**Personal story:**  I was sitting outside a convenience store and I called a mother an daughter over (trying to get with the 18-year old daughter).  I asked the mother her daughter's age and asked her if she would mind if I gave my number to her daughter.  The daughter shyly rejected me when I asked her (maybe because it was in front of her mother), but I use to always avoid approaching women with their parents or grandparents.

I would compare this to hitting a PR on a lift.

When you try to ""win"" at cold approaching, you will give up because you approaching the type of women you want may mean having a shitty success rate (I project about a 0.5%-3% success rate in the beginning), but over time you will get better at approaching women and see a higher success rate.

# Getting The Bitch Out Of Your System

Wanna know how to approach women?  Approach women.  Sorry, but there's no substitute for approaching women other than approaching women yourself.  Even if you use social media, dating apps, and going on blind dates, you still have to get your face in front of her face in person.  Your heart beating out of your chest, that feeling of weakness and timidity MUST be removed from your body and the only way you can do that is to take action.

No lie, if you walk up to a woman with a weak attempt to approach and get rejected, you will feel a million percent more confident than not taking action at all to spare your ego from rejection.

Your first 7-10 approaches are gonna be so intimidating that you may notice you're stumbling over your own words.  I suggest direct approach because you can say what's on your mind instead of trying to sound cool.  Women enjoy a man who steps to them genuinely instead of sounding like some guy who is trying to sound cool so she can validate him.  However, you'll realize that by doing this, your genuine self is actually cooler than you thought.

If a woman has nice legs, you can say something like,

""I was walking by and all I saw was some silky smooth legs.  What's your name?""

To get you in this mindset, I high recommend listening to Alan Roger Currie's audio book Mode One, along with his other works.

Some of you may think telling a woman she has nice legs is too forward, but the goal is to become bolder in your approach to convey the highest level of confidence a woman may have experienced from a man in her life.

Some of you may think being indirect gets the best results, but truthfully a woman would talk to you for hours because women LOVE male attention... so don't fall into this trap.  A woman may like your friendship, but does not want a sexual relationship.  Being direct helps you find that out in 30 seconds or less.

# Daily Practice To Get The Bitch Out Of Your System

Forget about getting the girl, focus on becoming bolder, more solid, and more confident after each approach.  Once you find out that your first approach was timid and weak, do a self-assessment and tell yourself to give eye contact and speak more clearly and a little louder so she can hear you.  Stand up straight with no fidgety movements.  The less movement you make, the more intense it can feel because you can't transfer that nervous energy.  What you are doing is disconnecting fear and shyness from approaching women.

ONLY APPROACH WOMEN YOU ARE PHYSICALLY AND SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO

Don't approach  an unattractive woman because you think it will help improve the success rate.  It's better to get rejected by 200 hotties and get 1 than to get 200 unattractive women you don't even want to touch.  These women must be attractive by your standards, not the standards of other men.  A woman may be average-looking, but she is sexy as fuck in the way she moves, the way she talks, and the way she acts around you.  You may prefer her over a ""baddie"" who has zero sex appeal (some women are generally hot, but they may not turn you on sexually).

When you run errands, scan your environment for attractive women.  If you see one, approach.  Remember that the goal is to get rid of that ""bitch energy"" that holds you back from approaching.  If you approach and get rejected, feel good about taking action, don't worry about the rejection because you have a goal to become bolder, more solid, and more confident in your approach.

# You Will Notice That You're More Interested In Making The Approach Over Getting The Girl

When you make it about taking action and approaching the girl instead of getting the girl, your confidence will increase.  You may even want to start seeing how you react to harsher rejection.  A lot of your rejections may be ""I have a boyfriend/husband"".  If you can handle harsh rejection, like getting ignored or cursed out, and still walk away with your ego intact, your confidence will show with other women.  Women may feel more turned on because you're so sure of yourself when you talk to her.  Eventually, you may experience a success after getting rejected so many times.  When this happens, treat it like this was suppose to happen (actually internalize that), and you'll start to see it happen at a higher rate.

109,What Comes After Getting Laid?,226,um94mz,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/um94mz/what_comes_after_getting_laid/,65,"A lot of guys who are just starting out think, “If I could just get laid, I’d be happy and all my problems would fade away”.

  
And yes, it is true that getting laid makes your life a LOT more awesome, in a million ways you couldn’t even begin to fathom. 

  
**But that’s not where the journey ends.** When you’ve improved yourself and gotten laid a tonne, you don’t suddenly hit the *end credits* *screen* of life, nobody comes down from the heavens above to congratulate you on *finally making it*, and life doesn’t just end. Yes, you’ve gotten laid a tonne. Yes, you feel like you’ve done something truly awesome; something most guys will never do. You’ve achieved something great; something nobody else can ever take away from you. But that’s not the end of your story; you have many more years (decades) left to live, many more things to accomplish, many more ways to spend your time, many more journeys to embark upon. Self-improvement will still be calling out to you, beckoning you to try something new, to learn and grow, to start the next exciting, new chapter.

  
**Getting laid is just the** ***beginning*****.** It really is.

  
Life is full of boundless possibilities, and you have such a ridiculously long time on this Earth; you have endless opportunities to try a million different things, to grow in a bazillion different ways, to experiment and make a trillion mistakes and learn from them, to go on a gazillion adventures and fundamentally change who you are as a human being. You have unlimited room for growth; getting laid is the first part of a truly amazing life that’s yours for the taking.  
You want examples? Here’s a few, in no particular order:  


* Making more **money**/starting your own business/getting promoted and working your way to the top of your career field.
* Building a **tribe**, building a group of loyal friends who’ll have your back no matter what. (I’ve got a few tribes myself – I’ve personally built my own inner circle of loyal friends, plus my group coaching clients feel like a tribe, plus you my audience, plus my forums).
* **Fitness and health** – losing weight, gaining muscle, building that dream body you want or pursuing a strength goal.
* **Relationships**, **kids**, **marriage** (if it’s something you want). Raising the next generation, finding an awesome woman and building something epic with her, raising some wonderful human beings and leaving behind an amazing legacy.
* **Love** and long-term intimacy; exploring the depths of human connection, finding out what the words *I love you* truly mean.
* Exploring different types of **sexual pleasure** – [3somes](https://howtohave3somes.com/), exploring your sexual bucketlist, tantric sex, karma sutra, BDSM, rough sex, gentle sex, learning to give women orgasms, learning to give yourself multiple orgasms (yes, that’s a thing. Yes, I do it all the time.)
* Making sex more **efficient**. For guys like me, Caleb Jones, and others, we become super efficient at sleeping with new women, and better at keeping women around for longer (retention). For other guys, they get into a relationship and build a strong sexual relationship with their partner.
* **Travelling.** Going to new places, having new experiences, meeting new people, exploring new cultures, seeing the world and all it has to offer.
* **Enlightenment**. Truth. Knowledge. Purpose. Some form of spirituality; or another way of phrasing that is, *“Why am I here? What is the point of all this? What’s my meaning of life?”*
* **Finding peace.** Letting go, learning to be more *stoic*, not being so bothered by external events, being more resilient when life throws up hurdles, removing attachment to things, letting go of fear, anger, frustration, pride, ego. Meditating more and relaxing.
* **Mentorship**, lifting other people up (men and women). Some guys phrase this as “giving back”. Helping others get to where you are now. (This is why I started my channel, started writing articles, coaching, my forums, etc. To get you guys to where I am now, and beyond.)

As for which one to pick, after you’ve gotten laid; *that’s entirely up to you.* I’m not your Dad; it’s not up to me to tell you how you should orient your life. But I’ll tell you something that’ll make you feel a little better: by the time you’ve achieved the massive goal of handling your sex life, you’ll have taught yourself a tonne of important skills – hard work, initiative, resilience, persistence. You’ll be in a pretty good position to be making the decision of where your life should go next. Trust me, **you’ll know what to work on next when the time comes**. So all you’ll need to do is trust your gut as to what you want to do; after all, once you’ve gotten laid a lot, your gut instinct would have served you pretty well thus far.

  
(But hey, if you’re still stuck – most guys jump into making money after getting laid a lot. So if you really can’t decide, start working on the money side of things, and see how you feel after a few months of that.)

  
So yes, getting laid is absolutely amazingly rewarding, a hell of a lot of fun, an important step for becoming a well-rounded, happy, masculine man… But that’s not where your story ends. If you take one thing from this article, it’d be this: I don’t want you to make the naïve mistake of thinking, *“If I just get laid a tonne, my life will be complete!”* No. Your life will be unimaginably better; that’s for sure. But getting laid is just the beginning of a wonderful journey that’ll span the rest of your life. Getting laid is step 1; and it’s arguably one of the most exciting steps, since for most guys it’s your first really big goal you’ll achieve – a goal that for some of you, might take a couple of years. That’s exciting, it’s novel, it’s new, it’s fun, it’s incredibly rewarding.

  
But you know what’s even more amazing than getting laid? The fact you get to repeat the *self-improvement process* all over again with the next goal, and then the next, and then the next. How amazing is it that you get to have *whatever you want in life*, as long as you’re willing to take action and work towards it? There are days I wake up so unimaginably happy because I know the secret to life: The entire world is our oyster; we’re literally allowed to have *anything we want*, if we put in the work.  
The only question left is to ask ourselves what we actually want.

  
So, **what do you want?**

  
You’re allowed to have it.",1652153162.0
110,The Red Pill helped me reach inner calm state which can lead to stoic calm state in the future,100,ulpuog,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ulpuog/the_red_pill_helped_me_reach_inner_calm_state/,16,"Before swallowing TRP i felt like i didn't have any control in my life, like everything was going on spontaneously and i couldn't do anything to maintain it. Because of that i lived in constant fear of ""losing"" my life, of becomming the loser. I was feared of not passing school-leaving exams, of not getting in university, of women, of rejection. I was feared of LIFE in general.

Luckily i swallowed The Red Pill just month before culminating point in my life (school-leaving exams and graduating high school) and the first upcomming thing was turning into the state called Red Pill Rage, which lasted exactly 1 month. During that rage i was angry at women and my social phobias got even worse.

After first week of Redpill Rage i realised i can wreak mine anger into something useful. I got motivated to study for my exams. I studied a lot. After the exam the rage disappeared, but i was still in fear, since i had to wait for my exam results.

The rage evaporated, but the motivation into activites and inner fire remained, so i used them to work out and work on myself. I was determinated to do something so i worked out regularly and worked on getting my holiday job.

1 year later (NOW) i reached every milestone i was feared of. I passed my school-leaving exams, i got into university, i am not scared of women, treat them just like normal beings, i am not scared of rejection. I'm not feared of LIFE.

Now i realised that i feel light inside my chest, that i am calm. I analysed again my last year of life and realised that the discipline and determination will guarantee reaching your goals, which goals will lead you into the state of inner calm, which will let you live stress-free life.

My theory is that if i will be able to remain in the state of inner calm long enough i will be able to reach constant stoic calm state in the future.

This was my first long post on reddit, also English isn't my native language so i hope you can understand my thought.

TL;DR Red pill rage helped me to stay disciplined and determinated to reach my goals. Those goals helped me to reach inner calm state. If i will be able to maintain that inner calm i think i can reach constant stoic calm state.",1652098459.0

Personally in my opinion if you’re not neurod divergent or mentally altered at birth you’re fucking pathetic for even treating the red pill as a win. It’s only an expectation.

You should’ve known all along with your normal functioning brain so stop acting like you’re worth a damn above the rest because you have found the red pill. If you really gave a shit about not being a weak bitch you would have used the mental ability all along to be self-aware.

I mean Jesus fucking Christ I found out I had autism at eight years old and at eight I started accumulating an abnormal level of self-awareness just to counteract the fucking thing.

Talking to Women Even Though You Have Autism is the same damn thing as being so weak at the gym that your absolute failure weight is 1/2 a lb. 

Stop comparing yourself to the nurotypical guys here

Let these assholes laugh at us. I fucking guarantee if they had been born with autism they’d be scared shitless to do half the shit we do despite our unpredictable brains.

It takes balls of steel to go to the gym knowing you can only lift half a pound of weight. You know people are gonna laugh at you and call you a bitch but you’re still showing up despite your disability. 

Same thing with redpill dating. You know how infantilized we are by women the fucking second they know we have autism.

Here comes my awesome pick up line again... Hey, you guys have a tissue?? I crouched to to come closer, she gives me a napkin from a hot dog.  


I ask her, that I know her and if she goes to that one technical school I also go to. She says yeah and that she doesnt know me because there is so much boys there and only a handful of girls. I say yeah the exact same thing said my ex from the same school before we met each other. I asked to which school the second girl goes to she answered. But both looked a bit annoyed and disgusted so I thanked and walked away.  


I've read some of the links on the sidebar, I found [killyourinnerloser.com](https://killyourinnerloser.com) on this sub some time ago and I've read what interested me in the TRP handbook 2nd ed. What tf do I do to stop being so beta. I messaged my good female friend, she said that the cringe even hurt her over text lmao.  


I am done with being such a goddamn loser. I am 20 yo, only had 1 gf that I kept for way too long, she's also the one I went to bed the first time at 19yo.  


I am generally fit been lifting for 10 months now, only have a bit belly fat that I've started losing about a month ago with diet.  


I was 100% sober as I do not drink, only weed sometimes if that matters.  


Generally I keep my head up, nothing is lost, I know I can change. I've already done a lot of steps in my life, talking to randos on the street for a lighter, asking for advice at the gym, taking up therapy 1 year ago, making friends in this city that I moved to 1,5 years ago etc.)

My hope is not lost! I may be a beta now, but that's something I am slowly improving. I just had to vent because I felt the need to.  


Call me out on whatever you have to, be critcal, teach me so I can grow.

113,First DATES: Why Rollo is wrong - response to his latest (May 5th) RM Clips,48,ujujd0,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ujujd0/first_dates_why_rollo_is_wrong_response_to_his/,74,"For an introduction, have been a follower, reader, and dare say, fan of Rollo Tomassi for the past couple of years. I acknowledge his contribution and would recommend everyone to read his blog and watch his vlog. Rollo has given us pertinent advice galore.

HOWEVER, on the subject of first dates and introductory dates, [he's slumping heavily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufwKYDdY9lM).  (link to his May 5th, 2022 vid). 

# Tl:rd 

Rollo is against coffee and walk-in-the park dates, saying that you must spike her adrenalin on ""action"" aka ""experience"" adventures (old Pua talk, btw). He's also speaking against going dutch and says that you must pay for your first date so that she can fall into your ""frame"". He wants you to take her into ""mud"" trucking dates, The Burning Man and whatever shit you have access to.

# WRONG 

The Coffee Date, because it is the easiest and most accessible to me, still stands as the the best way to go. Same thing for a drinks/bar date where I only buy and consume ONE drink. I'll have a good coffee at any time of the day. Or night. I could care less of what a woman thinks of coffee or whether she's been to a thousand coffee dates or not. And I will not pay for hers. Typically, I go in earlier, get mine and sip that pure pleasure. 

Because I never needed her company to enjoy my coffee to begin with. I drink and pay for only what I consume. Real talk.

Trying to impress a woman fails every time, Rollo.  You get her hyped on that hedonic treadmill and you have... shit is what you have. No, bro, I am the shit. Let her beta take her to ""new experiences"".

&#x200B;

# Unlike Rollo and many more out there, my goal is NOT to get laid.

&#x200B;

**My goal is to get whatever I get...with ZERO dollars spend. And if I don't get it...no matter.** 

**It was a shit\*y fishhole to begin with.**

&#x200B;

So fellows, go out on coffee/tea or any drinks type of dates. It's still the golden way to make proper introduction. OR you can just go to a park to smell the spring flowers. I also think we need to stop using the word ""dates"" and refer to them as simple ""meetings"".  Also, we need to stop using the word ""relationships"". It's ""situationships"". (I learned this from a woman. This is the subject of a future post).

# Because what she thinks don't matter. It never does.

&#x200B;

Until next time,

&#x200B;

Your man,

114,Uncertainty + Fear Of Rejection + Neediness = Creepy To Women,229,uj7sm7,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/uj7sm7/uncertainty_fear_of_rejection_neediness_creepy_to/,35,"I've written posts about cold approaching and giving women strong eye contact and some of the comments I got was ""that's creepy"" or ""cringe"".  In reality, even if you're below average-looking, if you give a woman good eye contact and have the confidence to talk to her, the woman is not really gonna feel creeped out.

I have approached many women and gave many women eye contact and they never get a creepy vibe from me.

So what do I mean by this formula?

**Uncertainty:** Hesitation makes you seem like you're up to no good or untrustworthy.  If you give her a drink, she may think you slipped something in it.  If you ask her to go to a private place, she may think you're gonna kidnap or rape her.  When a man is uncertain in himself, that energy transfers over into the interaction, and you give that vibe off to the women.  This is why men who lack confidence struggle with women... even if they are considered good-looking.

**Fear of Rejection:** If you fear rejection, you won't really approach the women you want.  There will be this ""I'm gonna approach/No I don't want to bother her"" battle going on in your head.  Instead of approach, you'll lurk around her.  You will give off stalk-ish vibes.

I would also like to add that **not being able to take rejection is creepy as well**.  If  a woman rejects you, but you keep lurking around her, she's gonna be creeped out and either avoid you or get someone to ""make you leave her alone"".

**Neediness:** Neediness usually comes in the form of wanting sex with any woman or wanting to be with a specific woman.  If you're thirsty for any woman, you're gonna feel the need to get every woman in front of you that you approach.  If you want to get with a specific woman, you will make grand gestures for this woman, like confessing your love to her and you never even had a conversation with her.  Even men in relationships can give off this needy vibe when they propose to their girlfriend in public if she's not interested in getting married to him, but only interested in just staying as boyfriend/girlfriend.  Women hate needy men because this desperation makes him weak for her.  Women despise weak men and this is why a lot of men struggle with women.

# How To Increase Your Level Of Certainty

Your confidence should not come from getting the girl, but taking actions needed to get better with women.  You will get rejected 90%-99.5% of the time, but you can still have a high level of certainty within yourself.  This certainty comes from taking action, even if you don't know if the woman is interested or not.  This certainty comes from self-improvement after each approach.  Every approach is practice and every rejection is a learning experience.

# How To Get Over The Fear Of Rejection

Getting rejected is actually a positive thing.  If a woman doesn't want to be with you (or can't be with you for whatever reason), it's better to take the rejection and leave her alone than to be in a shitty situation.  Embrace rejection.  Take rejection.  Move on.  Do a self-assessment and learn from your mistakes.

Before approaching your first woman, understand that you are gonna have a timid and weak approach.  You may even come off as creepy in certain instances along the way.  In the beginning, focus on building confidence and getting rid of that creepy energy.  The more women you interact with, and do a self-assessment to improve each interaction, the better you become.

Treat the women you get as small victories.  Don't treat it like a big victory because you may find out that every  woman you get is not for you.  If you treat it like a big victory, you may not want to leave a woman you got who is actually bad for you.

# How To Get Rid Of Neediness

Let's play the numbers game.  I know how much you love the numbers (I say this with sarcasm).

Let's say you live in a town of 10,000 residence.  Only 5,000 of those residence are females.  We know that every day, every week, every month, and every year a female turns legal age.  We understand that every woman is not attractive to us, but we have a range of attraction.  So let's say only 20% (1,000) of these women are attractive to us and are of legal age.  If we had a success rate (women we actually get to sleep with) of only 0.5%, that's still 5 women in this small town.

We are not restricted to a 5-10 mile radius.  We can move around.  Everywhere and anywhere you go, you have an opportunity meet attractive women... no matter how big or small the population is.

A simple exercise is to approach 1-3 women a day.  If you see a woman you think is attractive, go up and approach her.  Believe it or not, but being direct reduces the creepy vibe the better you become with women.  If you're fearful and awkward, telling a woman you want to fuck her sounds creepy and the women may get scared off, versus a guy brimming with confidence.  Him telling these women he wants to fuck them might get her pussy wet  Read some of Alan Roger Currie's books on his Mode One Hardcore approach.  You don't have to tell these women you want to fuck them, but being direct helps you build confidence faster.  It's like jumping into a cold swimming pool.  After a while, you get use to the temperature and get to have a nice swim.

# From Creepy To Cassanova

You will find out that starting out, you may give off a creepy vibe depending on the level of uncertainty, fear of rejection, and neediness you have.  Over time, when you practice talking to women, being upfront and honest with them, and being able to move on from the situation makes you come off as being very savvy with women.

The more women you interact with, the more you increase your chances of getting laid, as long as you let the women know what you want.  You won't get all the women you approach, but over time, you can get a lot more than not taking any action at all because you fear being creepy.

115,Don’t. Ever. Fucking. Quit.,451,uinwab,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/uinwab/dont_ever_fucking_quit/,47," All the years I’ve been helping other guys, through Reddit or on other forums, and with all the people I’ve seen make it – and even more who haven’t made it – I’ve tried really hard to figure out exactly why some people are successful and others aren’t.

Are you born into success? Are you just “lucky“, as many people say? As in, it’s preordained, and some people are just meant to find success, while others are always meant to be losers? Is that “just the way it is”?

Or is success a choice? Do you choose to be a winner? Do you choose to make it? Do you choose not to be defeated, choose not to give in?

And what makes a winner? What makes a loser? What makes someone successful – and is there a way to predict if someone will be successful?

I’ll tell you what, after all this time, I’ve gotten ok at telling who is serious vs who isn’t serious. But I use the word “OK” for a reason – it’s so goddamn hard to predict who’s actually going to stick in there and keep hustling and working for as long as it takes until they reach their goal. So a better question to ask is: With all my years of coaching and helping other guys and being into self-improvement, do I have a secret for success?

Do I have any tips?

Can I tell you how to be successful?

Yeah, I can. All this time, all these people, everyone I’ve ever met, all the people who made it and all who didn’t, there’s literally only ONE thing that matters – Just [don’t fucking quit.](https://theinnerwinnershow.com/71/)

Literally nothing else matters. That is the ONLY thing you need to do in order to be successful.

You don’t have to be competent. You don’t have to be amazing. You don’t have to be good. You can be a complete fucking hopeless mess, you can be full of insecurities and doubts and uncertainties and have no idea what you’re doing or if you’re gonna make it. You can feel like you don’t belong – I’ve talked about Imposter Syndrome all the damn time. I have imposter syndrome a lot. None of that matters – I’m a hopeless mess, and I still achieve things. None of my clients are perfect either. The only thing that matters is that you just don’t fucking quit. Ever.

Hang in there – that’s all you have to do. Tell yourself, “I’ll just keep working on this, and I won’t give up.” On your bad days, just survive – tell yourself, “I just have to get through today.” That’s it.

Your only mission is to never ever stop, never ever quit, and I promise you, you’ll eventually get to your goal. Even if it takes you 10 fucking years, as long as you NEVER quit, you will get there.

And that’s it – that’s the secret to success. Just don’t ever quit. It’s the only advice you need to hear from me – you could literally ignore every other thing I’ve ever said, except for that. Don’t. Ever. Fucking. Quit.",1651720199.0
116,Casey Anthony as the first true modern woman,91,uii30b,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/uii30b/casey_anthony_as_the_first_true_modern_woman/,28," **Casey Anthony epitomized something** that I couldn’t quite put my finger on as I sat on my couch, eating Captain Crunch and smoking weed, watching the coverage of her trial during a tranquil evening in the Summer of 2011.

There was something missing from my life at the time… I wasn’t conscious of it but felt its weight all the same. It wasn’t that I was unhappy- I was definitely comfortable; I had a career made possible through the the empty achievement of multiple college degrees, I had a fat girlfriend who was a *crazy bitch* but I *loved her anyway*, and I spent my free time feeling good… after all, life was about maximizing consumption while sleep-walking through minimal responsibility. The idea of ambition beyond this baseline was something foreign and laughable. Isn’t that the American dream? 

Yet still… alternating between video games, television, pornography, processed food, oxytocin and marijuana left a fuzzy feeling on my brain that something wasn’t quite right, but I wasn’t quite ready to see it just yet…

Casey’s story would never have worked as a piece of fiction, it wouldn’t have been believable. A pretty brunette gets knocked-up by a stranger on the Florida house party circuit and decides to keep the baby… and ends up missing the party lifestyle so much that she murders her own two-and-a-half year-old daughter to hit-up the party scene harder than before.

A true story of dopamine addiction gone mad.

And, as if to drive things into the realm of the surreal; push things until they explode, in the month before her arrest she was so thrilled to have thought that she had gotten away with murder that she got a tattoo to commemorate the occasion (“Bella Vita”). 

# Casey couldn’t give up the college girl lifestyle of enjoyable experiences and good vibes. She killed to party.

The media coverage would have tried to convince you that Casey was an anomaly worthy of social crucifixion, that her story may have been filled with sound and fury but it ultimately signified nothing; Casey was merely a bad apple.

**But what if Casey Anthony was the first** of something new and different; an *early adopter* of *emerging technology*. Someone so determined to break the shackles of personal responsibility and social expectation that she violently rebelled against an archaic system… Yes, there was blood, but this is rebellion; this was a *statement*, and in ten years young-adults may look back at the courageous Casey Anthony as a forerunner of after-birth abortion… after all, she didn’t feel like being a mother anymore so she broke up with it; it was an integrity move.

Feel good scolding Casey Anthony, queen villain, from your godly throne at your computer. Perfect son of God, ten years later- still chasing women on dating apps, using the right words in the right order to get to the end of the game- rest easy knowing Casey Anthony is entirely unlike you.

Part of being muscular, especially if you don't have great genetics or PED's is going on a bulk where you get kinda fat. Thats totally understandable and encouraged since you know there is a reason you're getting fat and you will eventually cut it off

But outside of fat as part of bulking, I wanna talk about staying lean and not putting on *unnecessary* fat...

118,[FIELD REPORT] Persistency paid off. I pulled a hot petite white girl after almost 2 hours.,196,ugs6w3,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ugs6w3/field_report_persistency_paid_off_i_pulled_a_hot/,70," **Stats:**

Age: 28

Race: Eastern Asian

Height: 5'7

Location: Las Vegas

&#x200B;

**Preface:**  April was a good month for me. I've pulled a total 6 girls last month and they were all pretty attractive. Definitely some of the hottest girls I've pulled since starting game. For those curious about the ethnicities: 1 hispanic, 4 white, 1 half asian/white. So this field report was from a Wednesday. I just had a date with a new FWB on Tuesday so I wasn't thirsting hard but I'm off for a few days so I had to run it. On top of pulling this girl, I also opened 10-15 sets that didn't really go anywhere. This is to show that I'm not pulling the first girl I meet. At the end of the day, this is somewhat of a numbers game however that doesn't mean you can't improve your probability. 

&#x200B;

**Set:**

**1.** 3 girls sitting near a table. I open them with a cold read. They're friendly and receptive. I make cold reads and statements on all 3 of them for like maybe 3 minutes. Two of the girls leave so now I'm left alone with this hot petite white girl with tattoos everywhere. Turns out she's 21yo and first time in Vegas. Let's call her Ashely (Ashely is my go to name in all FRs). The other two friends went back to hang out with their BF/other guy.    


Ashley is hooked onto me for sure. I can tell by the way she's looking at me. Her eye contact and smile tells me everything I need to know. I move in closer and gently physical escalate on her thigh and arm. Alright gents so this is one of my go to lines that has a pretty decent success rate: ""tell me something, have you ever kissed a cute asian boy before?"". She says no and we proceed to make out. Now, the line wasn't necessary. I could have escalated my way to the make out regardless. I just like being cheeky with my game. Rather the girl says yes or not, it doesn't really matter. I go in for the kiss afterwards. It works, not because of the line itself, it works because I'm well calibrated and know when it's on. The line itself is just a bit more verbal escalation.   


We make out for like 30 seconds and at this point, I'm like ok it's time to escalate logistically and pull. I tell Ashley let's go to the dance floor. She's like ""nooo I cant leave my friends"". You know, typical objection line. Okay fine let's go with your friends. So I suggested that to the group. I start leading the group to the dance floor and they changed their mind midway. They go back to their table. I'm like fuck, whatever I'll just number close for now since the night is still young.   


I go open maybe 10 more sets. Nothing I consider substantial with my current expectations. Later, I see Ashley sitting in between her two friends who are talking to their BF/another guy. Essentially Ashely is 5th wheeling. I walk up to her table and did Hand of God. I said something along the lines of ""quit fifth wheeling, come with me"". She enthusiastically hops up and grabs my hand. I just lead now. I take her to the bar and grab her a drink. We make out a bit more. I try to pull again but she's like ""i can't leave my friendssss"". Okay whatever, I take her to the dance floor, we dance and make out. I get more sexual with her on the dance floor. After this, I attempted to pull once more but she's says the same thing. We go back to her table. One of her girlfriends disappeared with some Asian promotor. The other friend is with her BF and wants to go home. I said something along the lines of ""fuck third wheeling, just stay with me, tell them you'll meet them at the hotel later"". Ashley complies and tells the couple that. The couple agrees and they leave. At this point I'm like SWEET, fuck yeah.   


I tell her let's get a drink elsewhere less loud, which is funny because the club wasn't even loud since we were in the outdoors area lol. She agrees. I lead her out of the club and to a bar. Tbh, this probably wasn't necessary but since my pull line is always ""let's get a drink elsewhere less loud"", I don't want to seem like a liar. Also, this after club bar is a good place to build comfort but with Ashley, I don't think I needed to build anymore comfort. I've probably spent like a total of 1.5 hours with her by now. We grab the drink and chill at the bar for like 5 minute and bail. We hold hands the whole time walking to my car. Adorable. I take her back to my place and yall know how it goes ;) 

&#x200B;

**Key Take Aways:** 

1. A common mistake alot of men make with club game is that once they start making out with the girl, they just dance/make out with the girl all night at the club until it closes. Noticed how I immediately turned my focus into pulling after the make out. My rule of thumb is that if she's down to make out with you, she's down to fuck you. The attraction is there. Now you need to solve logistics, ask for the pull, and maybe build comfort depending on the blueprint of the girl. 
2. Escalate logistically: Noticed how after the make out, I told her to come to the dance floor with me. The reason for this is because I wanted to escalate logistically. I am not gonna fuck her at the table. I am not going to fuck her on the dance floor either but the point is I'm moving the interaction closer to my place. 
3. Ask for the pull. The girl is VERY RARELY going to ever suggest the pull. As the man, you need to lead the interaction and ask for the pull. 
4. No doesn't always mean no: Ok don't cancel me for this lmao. I'm talking about in regards to the pull. No doesn't always mean no, it could mean not yet as demonstrated in this set. I asked for the pull 3 times and she said no 3 times. But I didn't let any of the rejections phase me. Eventually she finally said yes and it was my 4th attempt.",1651505322.0
119,"Do not be desperate for a gf, not because girls have the supposed desperation 6th sense, but to protect yourself from heartbreak",147,ugpmpy,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ugpmpy/do_not_be_desperate_for_a_gf_not_because_girls/,49,"

Let me summarize this as much as possible:

Liked a coworker, thought she liked me back, she said that she was not ready for it. Later she told me that she was raped. I felt awful about what happened to her and wanted to show her that I only had good intentions toward her. I tried to get closer to her, but I felt pushback and I started getting annoyed at the extremely slow replies. So, I mentioned that if she thought that I was too intense it would be better to not talk anymore. She got upset that I did want to be her friend anymore. I felt bad that she got upset with me. She said that needed to complete her college assignment because according to her words ""she was fucking her ex all summer and didn't dedicate time to her class"". That was probably the 4th red flag for me by this point. 1st was her getting upset over anything, 2nd was her being extremely slow to respond, 3rd was her belittling me for anything that she didn't consider of her caliber, 5th was she mentioned that everything that I did was a red flag. Well, I wanted her to really like me since I really wanted a gf, so I shut down all my gut feelings and offered to do all the college work for her. So, I was working my full-time job, took all my vacation time to help her, and all my free time, and I would be her cheerleader trying to encourage her because she would always be super sad always thinking that she was going to fail and all of that. Nobody wanted to help her, not her sister nor her ex (even though she was still super duper obsessed with him). So, I wrote a total of 16 journals in 3 months, all of this on top of all her verbal abuse because she had to correct grammar and sentence structure since English is not my native language. However, I did all the research and wrote everything. Later, I would get upset that she only texted me to ask me about the status of the paper and never texted me to hang out or to talk about anything else. To that, she replied that ""You are intense and your intensity scares me"". I was so sick and tired of her. She would have so much time to text and snap with her ex who left her because he didn't want to deal with a girl that was raped but had no time for the guy who was dropping everything else to assure that she graduated and didn't lose her job. Ohh yeah, I forgot to mention that if she didn't complete this class she would lose her job since the diploma needed to be submitted at the end of the semester to not lose employment at the company we work for. So, I was being the idiot who was doing free labor, and whenever I just wanted to quit, she would just guilt trip me with ""I thought that you cared about me"", and then would say with the sweetest voice ""I haven't given away the idea of us being together"". So me being the total idiot that I was I finally finished the class for her and got her an A. Then one week after the class ended she told all our cohort at work that I was a creep obsessed with her, and then she told me that if I ever contact her again she would tell HR about me... I was so brain fucked about what just happened. I just told her how she used me, and she said ""I would never use anyone. I am a good person. You did all of that out of your own free will"". And then she blocked me from FB and said that if I ever contact her through work, she would have me fired. She said that “You did help me, but that still hunts me"", and then she blocked me from FB. Later I realized that she destroyed my reputation at work to make sure that everyone would take her side if I ever complained about what she did to me.

I will always be super angry at her, but definitely more angry at myself for being so desperate for a gf, that I just let someone manipulate me like a fiddle and just threw away logic and my gut instinct just because I really wanted a gf.

TLDR: Forget about desperation being a turn-off. Do not be like me, do not be so desperate for a gf that you get PTSD and anger about someone leading you on for 3 months and then just throwing you into the guillotine, and then saying that it was all on you making everyone believe that you are the bad guy in the story. When everything that you did was help someone and all that you asked in exchange was more of her time to get to know her and form a deeper connection with her.

Edit: I forgot to mentioned that before she blocked me, she showed me her newly created OkCupid profile and told me how she would prefer to date any random stranger than me... Protect yourself from people like this by not being desperate...",1651498039.0

The Not-You rule is easy to spot: ""I don't wany a relationship (with you) right now."" ""I don't want to have sex on the first date (with guys like you."" ""I am not much of a texting person (with you or guys like you)"". 

It's the generalization of statements, that will fly out the window as soon as someone comes along that is deemed worthy enough for her attention, body and time. 

Spot the ""Not you"" sentences. There will not be only one of those, if she is applying them and she will use a hefty dose of gaslighting as well. ""No, I am not giving this other guy more attention, that's crazy."" ""Oh, you are jealouse of me? You probably need some therapy..."" 

Some of those sentences were uttered to me by a friend I admitted to like a few days ago. I am somewhat furious, but I don't want others to fall into this trap. If you get a lot of those, go away.

[Here is the video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT1JB5PbNbo)

So, it was one of those nights where I just felt so in the moment. I get to the party station around 11p.  I run into a few of the homies while I was watching the shakur fight. And then, one of my buds runs into me. I keep telling him to go approach some girls, but he was too nervous to approach. Therefore, I started approaching girls on his behalf. 

""Hey, introduce yourself to my friend right here"" And the girls would comply, then walk off. 

Eventually, I lose him and open these two chicks talking to each other. ""Whats going on?"" Etc. I didn't even realize the set had hooked until we were leaving the venue with both girls beside me. 

One girl was a 6 and the other was an 8. We get to my car, and the 6 jumps in the passenger. They were both feeling me so I didn't really mind. 

Got to my place and the 8 hasn't showed too much interest in me besides general questions. But, I have two girls in my house, with liquor, music, and good vibes, so I was enjoying myself.

I'm sitting next to the 8 on my couch and she asks me if she can pour ME a shot. We get up and leave the 6 in the living room while we go to my kitchen to get a shot. After the shot, she grabs my hand and asks me if there is somewhere we can go. 

I took her back to my room and drove her to Poundtown. No LMR, obviously.",1651546930.0

> “Contrary to conventional wisdom, when it comes to sex, less experience is better, at least for the marriage,” said W. Bradford Wilcox, a sociologist and senior fellow at the Institute for Family Studies (and an Atlantic contributor). In an earlier analysis, Wolfinger found that women with zero or one previous sex partners before marriage were also least likely to divorce, while those with 10 or more were most likely.

This relationship experience may affect the quality and stability of their cohabiting relationship and the odds of marrying their cohabiting partners. Consistent with Teachman (2003), who found that both sexual and cohabiting partnerships significantly predicted the odds of marital dissolution, our findings suggest that studies of union formation and stability should consider the full range of sexual experiences in early adulthood.

> sociosexually unrestricted individuals are more likely to: 1) engage in sex at an earlier point in their relationships; 2) engage in sex with more than one partner at a time; and 3) be involved in sexual relationships characterized by less investment, commitment, love, and dependency.  Sociosexual orientation (just like all other personality traits) is a relatively stable trait of individuals over the life course; in other words, people are either sociosexually restricted or unrestricted most of their lives… As you can imagine, sociosexual orientation has a great impact on the risk of divorce.  Sociosexually unrestricted individuals are far more likely to experience divorce than sociosexually restricted individuals because they are more likely to engage in extramarital affairs.

123,Game or Build Value?,84,ueqm5n,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ueqm5n/game_or_build_value/,64,"Game or Build Value? The perennial question. Lately it seems Game has fallen somewhat out of favor and Building Value has gained traction, at least as a theory if not as a practice.

If you asked me if Game works and only gave me one word to answer, I would say ""yes"". If you gave me two words, I would say ""it depends."" The key questions are where are you now, what do you want and what are your sticking points?

Some men already have value. Some men already have everything going for them ***except*** Game. They don't understand how women work or how the world works. Building more non-Game value will not help these men. These are the guys who can see phenomenal results from Game.

Some guys already have social skills and understand the psychology of women, but they are broke and tubs of lard. They don't need Game; they need to build value.

Most men are somewhere in between and could benefit from a bit of both. The exact ratio depends on their individual circumstances.

Game alone cannot build attraction. There is a minimal threshold of value that you have to have before the benefits of Game kick in.

Some guys say that Game cannot affirmatively build attraction; it can only help you avoid screwing up and losing attraction. I disagree slightly. I think Game can affirmatively build a little attraction enough to get you over the hump in interactions that are wobblers. At the end of the day, maybe it is just semantics whether Game is helping you by affirmatively building attraction or preventing you from losing attraction. The point is it can help.

Some guys say that with high enough value, you don't need Game. This is wrong. A higher value man certainly doesn't need as much Game, but you still need some. Zero Game is like mutiplying by zero in mathematics: it cancels everything else out. Men with zero Game, even good-looking men, repel women.  You need both. A cake may be made up mostly of flour but without the other ingredients, it's just a bowl of flour.

That said, one problem seems to be that a lot of guys develop an unrealistic expectation of what Game can do. They engage in magical thinking. They surrender to analysis paralysis, which prevents them from taking the action they need to take. This thing that could have helped them becomes a buffer.  Game is just psychology broken down into actionable steps to improve your odds with women. Use it, but don't overthink it.

My unscientific hunch is that nowadays the majority of men could benefit more from building value than focusing obsessively on Game  The principles of Game have so permeated the zeitgeist that you can probably pick up most of what you need through osmosis if you are halfway aware of your surroundings.  Still, let's not throw the baby (Game) out with the bathwater.

Game or Build value? You need both. You have to look at your individual situation to answer that. Chances are, you already know the answer, but you are avoiding it. You need both, but you probably are focusing the thing that comes more naturally and more easily for you at the expense of the other.  Whichever is easier for you, you probably need to focus on the other.",1651252160.0
124,"No one is more important than yourself,",124,uea53j,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/uea53j/no_one_is_more_important_than_yourself/,21,"I’ll try to summarize it in a way that doesn't support or condemn it either way, since I think that sort of summary is most useful.

Red Pill is a way of behaving, and group of ideas, focused on the following:

Women all have the same desires, goals, and faults. Evidence otherwise is misleading and false and therefore must be interpreted through the Red Pill ideas.

Men can be divided into Alphas (sexually attractive men) and Betas (men who are “nice” and who women manipulate). There are other sorts of men, but these are the two types discussed most often.

Women cannot truly love men as whole people, and therefore should not be trusted.

Men, when interacting with women and trying to build relationships with them (whether as a one night stand or as a marriage), must keep this in mind, and behave as an Alpha, while letting go of the dream of finding a genuine, loving woman (since women cannot be genuinely loving).

There are a lot of overlapping beliefs that are common in Red Pill, Men’s Rights Activism, and Men Going Their Own Way, but these are the fundamental beliefs of The Red Pill in particular.

The Red Pill also has a large focus on certain aspects of self-improvement that will help a man to become more attractive to women, while also helping him to regard himself as high-quality even if any particular woman does not. This is the most common summary given to people who question The Red Pill.

The methods they advise for these things sometimes overlap with general wisdom on self-esteem, and at other times overlap more with the idea that self-esteem comes at least partly from lowering one’s opinion of others. This idea can be seen elsewhere even in as simple a situation as public speaking: people are advised to imagine the audience in their underwear so that the audience will seem silly. This style of increasing confidence is, in the Red Pill philosophy, generalized far beyond specific situations like public speaking..",1651194493.0
125,Conquering your Fear of Rejection with Stoicism,66,ue1uiy,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ue1uiy/conquering_your_fear_of_rejection_with_stoicism/,8," This is a breakdown of a post from the Stoicism subreddit. Feel free to search for the title there.

**""Today I got rejected at the gym, and it felt so good""**

When you first step into cold approaches, even after lifting and getting below 8% bodyfat, there's a lingering force hindering you to go talk to every cute girl you see - the Fear of Rejection.

Abundance mentality comes after much time and experience, but a stoic mindset really helps some of the newer or anxious ones go out there and make the first move.

Here's the story:

>I consistently see this one particular girl at the gym, she’s nice looking, and several times over a few weeks we make eye contact, and so, naturally, I’m like, okay, she “MIGHT” be into me, maybe, somewhat?  
*So today, the gym closed at 5 and she happened to be parked next to me, and so, I put my gym stuff in the trunk of my car and before I head to the drivers side, I take a small breath, and I literally say in my head, “stoicism baby, whatever happens it’s cool, not a big deal”*

If anxiety is getting the better of you, force yourself into an outcome-independent mindset to purge your pussy-self out before approaching. You can also visualize worst case scenarios and go find peace from there. Having some BS catchphrase ready to force yourself into the mindset before approaching like ""Hakuna Matata"" or ""Worst case is nothing happens"" might also work for you.

You can also do this pre-game by meditating or working out ~~everyday~~ regularly before going out, you'll exude calmness with an undertone of confidence afterwards.

&#x200B;

>I go to her, small tap her car and she rolls down her window, I continued to say that I see her often here at the gym, and that I think she’s really pretty, finally I say if she’s seeing someone. She says she is but she is very flattered that I even came and did this. I said “oh hey no worries! what a lucky man he must be! Well! I won’t take too much of your time, thank you!” Finally she asked me what my name is and I said my name, and she said hers, and then it was farewell after that.

Good example of cold-approaching and not being just a creep eyeing her ass in the gym every time she works out.

Although his response after getting rejected is not 100%, it's still good, he now has an acquaintance and possibly a gym buddy. Who knows where they will be and what they're doing next week or month? Plus-points if he actually talks to her next time and consistently develops his social skills.

Remember, outcome independence in taking risks comes a long way, not just with women, but in career, goals, and life in general.",1651170824.0
126,"Challenge: ""Shoot Your Shot"" With 100 women in 100 days",71,udr8o6,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/udr8o6/challenge_shoot_your_shot_with_100_women_in_100/,49,"This is a really good challenge for the men who want to either find a one-night stand or look for their future wife or girlfriend.  Right now, you  may have a lot of women you would like to date or sleep with but, out of fear, you landed yourself in the friend zone.  A remedy to this is to ""burnout"" all the women you want to date but too afraid to ask out.

Let's say you have 10 women you would like to date or sleep with.  This challenge forces you to ask them out or move things in the direction you want it to go.

""What if they reject me?""

That's the whole point of the challenge!  If all 10 of these women reject you, you must move on and ask other women out.  This means if you see a woman you're attracted to, you have to try to get her number and move things in the direction you want it to go (a date, have sex in the near future, try to see if she's a candidate to be your future girlfriend or wife, etc).  Too many men will hold onto women and not make their intentions clear because they don't want to ""lose what they have"".  If you think about it, do they really have the girl if she put them in the friend zone, but he wants more?

The women you try to get with MUST be attractive by your own standards.  Don't lower your standards, but also don't try to get with a woman because your friends thinks she's hot.  It has to be YOUR own standards and no one else.  So if you see a woman you find intimidatingly beautiful, you have to approach her and try to get her number.  If you go for women you would normally think is out of your league, you lower them off of that pedestal and they start to feel more attainable because you will start to go for more women like that.  As you talk to these women, you'll notice that they're not as scary as you thought.

I will say this, you heart will feel like it's beating out of your chest and you will feel weak and timid in your initial approach.  But trust me, the more you do it, and the more consistent you are doing this, the easier it becomes.  You will see a ""stunner"" and your brain will go, ""She's hot, I'm going in"" without worrying about getting rejected.  After doing this, regret will be your issue, not rejection.  You will start to feel like crap if you don't approach.  You may actually prefer the rejection over just sitting on the sidelines avoiding rejection.

As a warm-up, you can talk to 3 women without trying to get their number or anything like that.  When you see that girl you want to talk to, you will feel more social and you decrease your chances of bitching out.

I highly suggest you buy a daily planner and mark the days you approach and how many women you approach in that day.  I suggest trying to approach 1 woman every day for those 100 days, but sometimes we don't see the women we really want.  Consistency builds momentum.  If you let too many days, weeks, or months pass, you'll get rusty and feel like you're starting over again.  You can approach more than one woman a day, but 1 woman a day is the minimum.

Maybe after 100 days, you get no dates.  Don't feel like a failure.  You broke out of your shell and overcame your fear of rejection.  You may decide to keep doing the challenge beyond 100 days because you noticed that your confidence has increased.

On a positive note, after 100 days, you might get 1-3 women who say yes.  If  so, you'll be so glad you decided to do this challenge instead of letting the fear of rejection get the best of you.

127,Don’t Be Average – Don’t Accept Society’s Blueprint For Your Life,228,udjvv1,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/udjvv1/dont_be_average_dont_accept_societys_blueprint/,37,"This it’s a collection of several half-written out ideas I’d thought I’d throw together and finally flesh out a bit into a post that might help some of you guys.

I’ll start you off with a single idea: Most people are comfortable/complacent and **don’t ever stop to think about what they want from life.** They just do what everybody else is doing, for the sole reason of: *“Everybody else is doing it.”*

Sure, everybody else is doing it. That’s because everybody else is *average*.

**Fuck average.** Fuck “normal”. Fuck doing what everybody else is doing – that’s a one-way ticket to a mediocre, *average* life.

People go to university, just because everybody else is doing it. People fall into relationships with people they’re not that into, just because everybody else is doing it. People settle for a marriage that has a greater-than-50%-chance of divorce, just because everybody else is doing it. People have kids without even stopping to think, *“Do I want kids? If so, what kind of parent do I want to be? How can I find a partner who’ll be a great mother/father to my kids?”*

To be clear, I’m not saying marriage, kids, starting a family are goals you shouldn’t go for. In fact, those are some of the most rewarding things you could do in life. But make sure you actually *want* those things, and aren’t just doing them because “That’s what everybody else is doing!” Life’s too short to blindly follow along with other people. After all, most people are totally full of shit and have no idea what the fuck they’re talking about:

And if you *do* want those things – marriage, kids, a certain career, etc – **decide you’ll be the absolute best at each one of those goals.** Go 100% all-in and *crush* everyone around you. If you want kids, be the best motherfucking parent the world has ever known. If you want marriage, go all-in and decide you’ll build the most kickass, most rewarding marriage on the planet, and then do *whatever the fuck it takes* to make that a reality.

Don’t hold back.

Those who aren’t willing to go 100% all-in and do whatever it takes to be happy/successful; we call those people “average”. And is the average person happy – **I mean truly, wonderfully, beautifully happy?** Of course not. Not even close. *Henry David Thoreau* said it best:

*“The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.”*

The average person is complacent, lazy, comfortable… god I shudder at that word. *Comfortable*. As if there’s nothing more to achieve, no next hurdle to overcome, no next mountain to scale. “Comfortable” is another way of saying, “I’ve given up.”

And I get why the average person is happy being complacent – **it’s easy.** It’s secure. The path is already laid out for you; you just have to follow it. Find an average-looking woman, have average-looking kids, be average with your health and average with your career, die at an average age and have an average number of people attend your funeral. None of that is hard; it kinda just happens with absolutely zero effort.

In contrast, pushing yourself is fucking *hard*; it takes a hell of a lot of effort. We’ve set some crazy goals for ourselves here – stuff the average person could never even contemplate, let alone be arrogant (and *ballsy*) enough to actually attempt. Make no mistake; **If you’re into self-improvement, you’re playing life on hard mode.**

Fuck society’s rules.

But do you have any other choice? I mean YOU, the person reading this right now. Are you the type of person who can just be average and do whatever everyone else is doing just because it’s easy? I certainly can’t. I don’t want to get to my deathbed, regretting the things I didn’t do, the goals I didn’t even bother trying to achieve. I don’t want to get to the end and know I could have done more, had more, been more…

*Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, ‘It might have been.‘*

 *- John Greenleaf Whittier*

The whole point of this post is to get you to sit down and think about what you *truly* want. Your future is something you should do because you planned to do it; not something you just “fell into” because everybody else was doing it. *Pick* the goals *you* want to achieve. Be the person *you* want to be.

**The average person** ***sucks.*** [Don’t be the average person](https://theinnerwinnershow.com/143/), unless you want to be full of regrets when you start getting old. I want you to be able to embrace old age full of peace, knowing you lived the life you chose, did the things *you* wanted to do, instead of just doing what everybody else is doing. 

I’ll leave you with some lyrics from a great song I love – *Ready to Start* by *Arcade Fire*.

*that the emperor wears no clothes.*

*But they bow down to him anyway.*

128,It's your Responsibility even if it's not your fault.,299,u8ue7l,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/u8ue7l/its_your_responsibility_even_if_its_not_your_fault/,21,"It's your Responsibility even if it's not your fault.

You could give us a laundry list of the ways your woman/women treated you shabby and maybe we would agree that, yeah, that's pretty shabby. But you still need to take responsibility for it.

First off, you probably are at least partly responsible-you let it happen on your watch. 

You have the power to prevent or at least limit such problems by: 

1. properly screening at the beginning of a relationship;
2. setting proper boundaries and modelling proper behaviors during a relationship; and 
3. having the awareness and nuts to kick her to the curb, if her behavior makes things untenable.

So it probably is your fault, at least in part.

But even if it is theoretically all her fault, you still need to take responsibility for it. On the surface, saying that *you* have to take responsibility for *her* shabby behavior might feel like white-knighting. It's not.  

You take responsibility not because she is blameless, but rather because taking responsibility puts the power to change things for the better back into your hands. You're not trying to save her; you are saving yourself. Nobody cares as much about your best interests as you do.  And when your problem is that you haven't nutted up in the past, nobody else can nut up for you, even if they wanted to. You have to do it.",1650566302.0
129,How Cold Approach Makes You More Selective,169,u8dwhl,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/u8dwhl/how_cold_approach_makes_you_more_selective/,58,"On my attraction scale, I have 3 main levels-- hot, cute, and fuckable.  Anything lower than fuckable on your scale of attraction is you lowering your standards.  When you cold approach, be selective.  Don't get desperate and try to get with women below your standards in the looks department, but also, don't try to get women who treat you like shit, but they're ""baddies"".  The beauty of cold approaching is you're the selector.  You're not leaving it to chance.  You also start to see the many options you have when a new attractive woman enters your field of view.

*So let's say you approach a very cute, 20-something.  She rejects you.  Twenty minutes later, you spot a hot woman with a round butt in short shorts and some silky smooth legs.  You shoot your shot with her, but she rejects you.  A half hour later, you spot a fuckable (short, slim, no make-up, average-looking) woman who is wearing a skirt.  She has small tits, but the legs of a dancer.  Her face is average-looking, but she is very sexy in her mannerisms.  You shoot your shot with her, but this woman gives you her number.  You set a date with her for the weekend.  The weekend comes and the both of you go on a coffee date and later on, have sex.*

*Aren't you glad that you have the capacity to take a lot of rejection and have the patience to keep approaching the women you're attracted to until you're successful?*

If there's one thing I can say about cold approaching women is it allows you to get what you want.  You may not be able to get a specific woman, but you can get the women you like if you are able to take rejection and have a lot of patience.  Be willing to take rejection until successful.

130,Stop putting your attractive female friends and acquaintances on a pedestal.,143,u50a7d,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/u50a7d/stop_putting_your_attractive_female_friends_and/,12,"We all have been or know a certain type of guy: he will be hanging out in a group of guys, just talking and acting completely normally, when an attractive girl shows up. Now this guy has no intention of actually trying to fuck or date this girl, and may already have been put in the friend zone, but despite this, a notable change in his behavior occurs. He starts cracking more jokes, likely at other guy's expense. He acts more aggressive and masculine. Overall, he does whatever he can to make sure that attractive girl pays attention to him, and that she talks more to him. 

Lets be real: as a man, you have a weakness to attractive women. Whenever one shows up, you are drawn to them, and it is as if an invisible force is guiding to be close to them as possible. This is perfectly normal. Our evolutionary past has engrained in us a biological imperative to mate with as many women as possible, so it makes sense that you are drawn to this. But you cannot allow this to impact your daily interactions. You should keep one key principle in mind: *unless you are actively trying to fuck the girl infront of you, treat her as if she's a 45 year old fat slob of a man.* Essentially, there no point allowing your attraction to a girl impact your behavior toward her unless you are going to try to get with her. Attractive women live lives on easy mode: people are just nicer to them, random guys will do favors for them in order to get closer to them, and overall everyone just treats them better on the basis of their looks. There is not point perpetuating that and allowing often shallow, unintelligent people who have no real talents advance far in life because you are a simp.

This extends to even just normal female friends and acquaintances you have. Don't treat them any differently, whether it be being nicer to them or trying to hang out with them more, if there isn't the active intention of trying to fuck. Because what is the point otherwise? You are merely putting someone on a free pedestal. We all know those attractive girls who has a plethora of guy simps orbiting around her, always trying to weasel their way into her good graces despite having absolutely zero chance of actually sleeping with her. Don't be like those simps, be better. There is nothing wrong with having female friends, but be friends with them on the merit of their personality or companionship, not their looks.",1650123239.0
131,Cold Approach And Day Game--Your Very First Approach,128,u3uuo5,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/u3uuo5/cold_approach_and_day_gameyour_very_first_approach/,42,"Before you can sleep with the hottest woman you've ever laid eyes on, you need to learn how to get over your fear of rejection.  I highly suggest accepting the fact that your first approach is gonna be weak and timid.  Just like any new skill, you're not gonna be very good in the beginning.

Think of your first approach as doing a fire walk at a self-improvement seminar.  Walking across the fire will help you feel some kind of achievement in overcoming your fears.  This will be your foundation to your game.  Whenever you see an attractive woman, it's an opportunity to overcome your fear.  Don't worry about getting her, focus on overcoming your fear.  After a while, you'll notice that you're more comfortable approaching women... even while their friend or co-worker is watching.

I've walked into stores and approach a store clerk with her co-worker standing right there.

In order to do this, you need to get into a mode where your goal is to approach women for self-improvement purposes, not necessarily to get the girl you're approaching.

""Why am I gonna approach a woman and not try to get her?""

Think of cold approaching and day game like sparring or playing a pick-up game of basketball.  It's not a championship.  The steaks are not high, but the more you spar and the more pick-up games you play on the court, your skills improve.  When you actually compete in a real championship, you'll be better prepared than a man who didn't put in the practice.

If you think you have to be a Chad to approach women, try approaching a pretty girl in the street.  You may be shocked at how polite she is.  You may notice a lot of women telling you they have a boyfriend.  This is a rejection.  Take it for what it is and move on.  Focus on women who have genuine desire for you.  This is why, if you've read my posts, I talk about having a success rate in the range of 0.5%-3%.  We are not trying to convert women who are not interested into women who are interested.  We are focusing on women who have genuine desire.

""But women don't like me.  I don't look like an Alpha Chad""

Do you know that there are men who look very average and they have women who adore them?  All women don't like one type of guy.  Some of these guys ya'll call Alpha Chads struggle with women too.  How?  Because if a woman is not impressed by their looks, they don't know what to do next.  It's like a guy who's 6'8 and weighs 250 lbs, but he can't fight.  Being that he looks intimidating people don't fuck with him.  If a man actually challenged him, he would be fucked.  In other words, some of the ""Alpha Chads"" are one-trick ponies.  They coast off of their looks.

When you start approaching women, you'll make small improvements to give yourself an advantage.  You might start dressing better.  You might buy multiple pairs of shoes and shop regularly.  You might start a cologne collection.  You might start working out to get in shape.  If you wear glasses, you might start wearing contacts.  If you don't wear glasses, you might start wearing glasses that have a stylish frame.  You might have weekly or bi-weekly haircuts or style your hair a certain way.

If you treat cold approach and day game like a fire walk to help you overcome your fear of rejection, you will have a lot of fun... even if you're getting rejected 90%-99.5% of the time.

132,My mother was an alcoholic,166,u0cmag,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/u0cmag/my_mother_was_an_alcoholic/,64,"My mother was a bad alcoholic. My father, a good man, but weak. When my mother drank, things got ugly. Cursing, yelling, hitting, and just disappears into the night. The smell of alcohol when I would come home from grade school. For some reason my father never kicked the shit out of my mother for her behavior, than again, he didn't want her to leave. I was probably 7 or 8 years old when I experienced this shit. I don't know how many times I called the cops on her. Yet, I remember it all. I guess thats how you know how fucking bad it was and your brain decides to bury this trauma, protecting you from you. 

I didn't realize I had bad abandonment issues until I finished reading No more mr. Nice guy. I began to have bad headaches when I realized I did. 

My mother in a violent drunk state one time try to take my sister and I somewhere unknown without the van. I was scared. Crying. I didn't know what the fuck was going on. Cops came. It was a shit show. I felt as a child; scared, abandoned, and alone. Someone who is supposed to love me, would disappear drunk from time to time. I never wanted someone to abandon me again. And because my father didn't do nothing but plead my mother to calm down. It showed me to brush it off like he did. He would work day and night shifts, so he wasn't home when shit went down. 

It's probably why I held girls on the high pedestal my entire life. I didn't want them to leave like when my mother would leave in the middle of the night. Disappear. It was fucked up. It's probably why I was depressed and riddled with anixety when girls would break up or reject me. I couldnt bare the idea of them leaving. I thought it was the end of the world. I was just a little boy and I grew up a little boy not knowing better. My father would brush it off because he didn't wanna be alone. And so I would brush off my mother's drunk abusement. My father was a good man, worked hard, but he was weak.

He too dealt with abandonment issues due to being a orphan. I realized him being so nice to people is a way for people to like him so they wouldn't leave. And in some weird fucked up way, I was a nice guy to people and girls so they wouldn't leave me. Everyone would like me. I wouldn't be alone. To be honest... it's probably why I felt so alone in my life. This hollowness because of the horrible things that's happened to me. Childhood trauma can be debilitating. 

My mother is much better now and that was years ago. I love my parents very much for all they did for. My mother was going through a dark phase in her life. But discovering all this.. I'm becoming a Man. Overcoming the pain, my struggle. I know now that this is my life, no one elses. I've walked this journey on my own. Facing my demons. Undoing the chains of trauma, and soaring to the heights of transcendence. This is my life.

It's just crazy I'm just realizing all this shit now.. I guess cause I've taking better care of myself; meditating, reading about PTSD and finished reading NMMNG, taking shrooms to help understand myself. It was only after working out did I realize this shit... I reached an epiphany. Working out really does take you to a higher plane of thought.

I hope all you reading this will find hope that you can get better. That things will get better. The Redpill is hard to disgust and I'm still finding out things about myself that's been hidden. It's been 4 years since I've discovered the redpill, it's just the beginning.

It is through trauma that the we die in the fire, but it is through facing our trauma that we rise from the ashes. Free yourselves from the deep traumas you buried and face them. It's going to hurt like hell but you'll survive. I've seen horrors no man should see but I still stand strong.

(before redpill just for context)
I was about to complete my engineering, had a girlfriend whom I ofc kept on pedestal. Education was shit, merely cleared my engineering. Had no purpose in life. Used to watch TV/series all day. Did not study at all. Suddenly I came across a post, it was about redpill. I started relating to it, it spoke about relationships, purpose of life and other redpill stuff. Dug deep into the topic.
As I kept reading I started to realise why girls do what they do, why people do what they do. Started looking at everything from a redpill perspective and it actually gave me a clear idea. Before, I used to blame my girlfriend for acting out, later I realised it was me being a pussy. Going off topic, this post is more about hanging in there. Anyway let me shift back!

Post redipll, I began searching to do something, finding a propose. Picked a technology from my domain started working(studying). Kept on for about 4-5 months, later realised there is no future scope (it was related to mechanical). 

Later discovered a course to switch my domain to IT. Studied for its entrance exam day in and out this was the only chance to coverup for the lost years.
I was in top 100, amongst 50k students who appeared for the exam. 

The course is still going on. I'm sure I would grab a more than decent job post the course. I've been working(studying) for minimum 12hrs a day for past 6-7 months. I know there are many who work far more than me.  But I feel good looking at the past me who did not study/work at all. Past me would have never thought that even I could get this far. I could even study for that matter!
I'm certainly at a better stage rn!
During the course I also had an operation, I was bed rested for entire 2 months, but didn't feel sorry for my self, which I would have if it wasn't for redpill.

For some it would be just a rant but had to let it off my chest, giving it back to the community.

Summing up, just don't give up, it won't come tomorrow but eventually it will. For the beginners with nothing to do and trying to figure out what to do a tip - just pick one thing and start studying I guarantee you'll find something to do or something you're good at, not tomorrow but eventually!

Things I've learnt 
1. Don't worry what others might think
2. Don't satisfy other's ego
3. Don't seek for validation
4. Don't feel sorry, rather introspect, figure out what went wrong so that you won't repeat the same mistake.
5. Life is about learning from mistakes rather than cursing yourself
6. They don't think about you as much as you think they might be thinking (think about it)
7. Try to stay away from chicks untill you become successful (don't think only about chicks all the time)
8. No one will give a shit about you, untill you are successful
9. Get a new pair of underwear every 6 months
10. Lastly, don't try to act smart, if you are it is just about time it will be reflected by your success. Just work with dedication.",1649536917.0
134,If Women Are Lionesses--Are You A Male Lion or An Impala,131,tzoznj,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/tzoznj/if_women_are_lionessesare_you_a_male_lion_or_an/,46,"After men become Red Pill-aware, they tend to think of women as these evil beings who hate men.  I won't elaborate on that, but I will ask you this--If a woman is a lioness, are you a male lion (she's your counterpart) or an impala (her prey).

If you're a lion, you understand that the lioness hunts and you get the first bite of her kill.  If you're an impala, you'll always be at the mercy of the lioness.  You ARE the kill!

Women have two types of nature, to submit to a man or to use a man for his resources, attention, time, and energy.  The man she submits to, he gets as much sex as he can handle.  It's not about controlling her, it's about not allowing her to control YOU.  If she's using you for resources, attention, your time, and attention, she feels entitled because, in her mind, ""you should feel glad she's paying attention to you at all.  This is why I think men should only deal with women who have genuine desire for you.

In the animal kingdom, are lions and lionesses bad?  No, they're just meat-eaters who hunt.  When you see lionesses take down a giraffe, the giraffe is not good and the lionesses aren't bad.  It's all about perspective.  Lionesses have to eat and the giraffe doesn't want to be eaten.

Don't be part of a woman's meal plan! Women aren't bad for wanting to take advantage of a man and a man is not good because he doesn't want to be taken of.  A man is not bad because he wants to fuck a lot of women, and a woman is not a ""good girl"" because she's not fucking every guy she meets.  If you put a woman in the right environment, with all the men she's sexually attracted to, you may see a different side of her if you were a fly on the wall in that environment.  Even so, this doesn't make her bad.  It's just perspective.

So, fellas, are you the male lion that she submits to or are you the impala who's part of her meal?",1649493405.0
135,Aiming High Means Falling Far,249,twl853,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/twl853/aiming_high_means_falling_far/,20,"I’ve noticed a tonne of guys read self-improvement subs like this one buy books on achieving their goals, listen to podcasts and watch videos and do everything they can to soak up as much knowledge as possible. They study for ages, often getting caught up reading this stuff for weeks, months and sometimes *years*– never actually starting their goals. They’re essentially just **procrastinating.**

I’ve posted about diving in and taking action being *far* more beneficial than sitting around studying, reading and learning. Sure, knowledge helps – but at the start, you need to just dive right in and get started; you can study your books and sites and guides **once you’re already taking action.**

I think this procrastination/avoidance comes from a fear of failure. It’s a fear of rejection, a fear of fucking up, a fear of doing something “wrong”. It’s fear-avoidance. “If I just gather as much knowledge as I can first, then I’ll know all the pitfalls to avoid, and I won’t have to worry about looking foolish.

”It’s also a fear of straying from the herd; a fear of making a mistake and then being called out on it by everyone else/society at large. It’s a fear of *sticking out like a sore thumb*.

But you guys reading this have to remember\*\*, you’re not an average person.\*\* The fact you care about self-improvement and want to better yourself already means you’re part of a small, select group. You’re a *high-achiever*(even if you haven’t achieved your goals yet – you’ll get there). In order to hit those great heights you’re destined for, you’re going to fail many many many times – sometimes miserably.

It’ll suck. It’ll hurt. It’ll be embarrassing, often humiliating, and sometimes you’ll want to run back home with your tail tucked between your legs and hide until the blankets. Girls will reject you and it’ll suck. You’ll fail lifts at the gym and it’ll suck. You’ll spend $300 on a bunch of new outfits only to have people tell you they don’t suit you, and it’ll suck. You’ll cheat on your diet and it’ll suck. You’ll fail a million times at your career and it’ll suck.

Failure is part of life. **You can’t hide from it if you want to be a successful person.** The average person spends his/her entire life running from failure, avoiding it, being terrified of it – and living a life of shitty complacency.

*The mass of men live lives of* ***quiet desperation***

* *Henry David Thoreau*

And I get why the average person is happy being complacent – **it’s easy.** It’s secure. The path is already laid out for you; you just have to follow it. Find an average-looking woman, have average-looking kids, be average with your health and average with your career, die at an average age and have an average number of people attend your funeral. None of that is hard; it kinda just happens with absolutely zero effort.

In contrast, pushing yourself is fucking *hard*; it takes a hell of a lot of effort. We’ve set some crazy goals for ourselves here – stuff the average person could never even contemplate, let alone be arrogant (and *ballsy*) enough to actually attempt.

Sitting on your couch eating Doritos is *infinitely* easier than anything we talk about on here. Improving yourself opens you up to failure – you’re vulnerable. And vulnerability can be fucking *scary*. Being average means you never have to be vulnerable, or take a risk, or look like an idiot. \*\*You never have to fall.\*\*But if you want an above-average life, then failures are inevitable. Failures are unavoidable if you want to reach your goals. You’re *going* to fuck up, no matter how hard you try. Especially if you embrace the idea that this is all just a [big experiment](https://killyourinnerloser.com/this-is-all-just-a-big-experiment/), and you need to carve your own path. You’re essentially straying from the beaten path and forging your own destiny; you’re travelling into the unknown without a map to guide you. You’re going to fuck up, **and that’s ok.**

In all my years of giving advice, I’ve put a hell of a lot of effort into trying to figure out exactly what the “secrets to success” are. And there’s only one that keeps coming up. Nothing else really seems to matter but this:

**Just never fucking quit.** That’s it.

It’s not “don’t make mistakes”.

It’s not “avoid looking silly.”

It’s not “never fall from grace”.

The only thing you need to keep in your brain is: “As long as I never quit, **I will** ***eventually*** **be successful.**“

Failing is fine – you just need to pick yourself up and carry on. Embrace failure. Embrace rejection. Just don’t quit, and I promise you, no matter how many times you stumble, you’ll eventually reach your destination. And you’ll be a whole lot better for the journey – you’ll be a more battle-hardy, well-rounded man.

136,The influence of education on female income.,145,tvceuh,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/tvceuh/the_influence_of_education_on_female_income/,47,"This is a topic which has captivated my interest for some time now. Over the years I’ve read a lot of material in RP spaces concerning female ‘independence’, women reaping more benefits from social security, paying fewer taxes etc. Also, many users here are aware of the BS degrees that are available nowadays and how especially women tend to favor these. So I decided to run some very basic, publicly available numbers myself to see how much truth some of these writings contain.

My ‘research’ takes a look at Dutch College participation rates between Males/Females and also how Male/Female earnings compare between ages 25-45. The reason I picked the 25-45 age bracket is that from the year 2000 forward, there were more women in college than men, as can be seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/uFwfwn3). Therefore, it should on paper make sense that women also surpassed men in terms of income, right?

&#x200B;

The graph is from 2020 and demonstrates the rapid increase of females in higher education, surpassing men approximately in the year 2000. I’m assuming these numbers are comparable to countries such as US/UK/Germany/France/Sweden/Norway/Switzerland etc.

[The exact percentages](https://imgur.com/wItliCh) of persons with at least a college degree in 2020

For every 100 men with a college level degree between age 25-35, there are currently 122 women.

&#x200B;

For every 100 males studying medicine in university, there are 212 females. [Here.](https://imgur.com/a/oRQ9DjD)

&#x200B;

Female majority (20-25 yo's) only in municipalities with colleges. See [here.](https://imgur.com/a/mv1p1KX)

Far more men keep living in the countryside.

Men keep living with their parents more often & longer. [Here.](https://imgur.com/a/6x7S9lV)

Another interesting fact I stumbled upon while researching this; although around age 23 in some cities the male/female ratio is 100 males for every 140 females, at age 29 this ratio has vanished and is back to 1:1. [This](https://imgur.com/a/RvNH3sa) is the demography of Utrecht, a city notorious for the amount of female students. As can be seen, the amount of women living in the city starts to rapidly decline after age 23. The amount of men only starts to decline after age 30. Arguably, one of the main driving factors for women leaving the city sooner than men, *is a shortage of men.*

&#x200B;

Like I said, for the sake of this ‘research’ I specifically looked at the 25-45 years old bracket because I wanted to see how those education rates would impact how much females earn. Obviously it had a positive impact, but perhaps not as significant as you would expect.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/UDSND7z) is a distribution of male earnings age 25-35 and 35-45 in Euro’s.

The average man between age 25-35 earns: €40k

The average man between age 35-45 earns: €53.5k

&#x200B;

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/OL78gES) is a distribution of female earnings age 25-35 and 35-45 in Euro’s.

The average woman between age 25-35 earns: €31k

The average woman between age 35-45 earns: €34.7k

&#x200B;

[Arguably the most important statistic:](https://imgur.com/a/xjYA9x8)

Men between ages 25-45 brought in a total of €96.6 billion in 2020 (income).

Women between ages 25-45 brought in a total of €65.4 billion in 2020 (income).

Meanwhile, for every 100 men with a college degree between the ages of 25-45, there were about 116 women with at least a college degree.

&#x200B;

Looking at these statistics, it can be concluded that every euro of tax spend on female higher education is significantly less effective than every euro spend on male education, at least, ***from a direct economic and tax income perspective.*** This does (at least not necessarily) mean that it’s inherently less valuable to educate women from a societal perspective, because there are of course many other factors to consider.

 Why is this the case? Because the reality is, society has made the masses so ""weak"" in the mind that anything you say against anyone, people will get ""offended"" by it. People aren't programed to hear the truth. For example, why's that everyone who participates in something gets an award nowadays? Remember as we were growing up and whenever we participated in anything, it was only the top 3 who got an award. Nowadays? Everyone gets something even if they suck at it, so they don't ""feel"" bad or their ""feelings"" don't get hurt. It's all about ""feelings"" nowadays, but comrades, the facts don't care about your feelings. So, this just shows society is programming people from a young age to be ""entitled"" to something even when they're not. And when these people go out in the real world with their coping strategies they're never prepared for it, and they get hit so hard by the reality which they're not prepared for, and then these are the types who're voting to make ""UBI"" a mandatory thing, and chant for even more welfare programs etc because they have no skills of their own. They like to rely on others because they think they're ""entitled"" to it. 


The reality is, no one gives a fuck about you. Men must harden the fuck up. If you think that by you ""opening up"" to someone will make them respect you more, then you haven't accepted TRP.  Every person on this earth has some sort of ""sob story."" Well, even if you have went through the worst times possible, what can you do? In the end, YOU have to make something of this life, and get ahead in anyway possible that you can. Because in the end, it's just you. Since the dawn of time it has always been survival of the fittest, and never survival of the unfittest. Every person here must master machiavellianism. Regarding how to act, what to say in each and every situation they're confronted with, and use it for their own benefit in a very clever and intellectual way, because no one is helping you out there. You have to help yourself.


Majority of men spend their whole lives in thinking what she/society will think about me and guess what? They're left nowhere. They neither achieve their goals, because they put others above them, and they lose all the respect people had for them. Why? Because they keep on obeying and bowing down to society and taking it up the ass from them, and then they are taken for granted. Once you're that vulnerable, your destiny is only to get used and be thrown out. You must never be too agreeable, rather, stick to your principles and values. Always.





Majority of men who keep living in the hope strategy are only getting through by using all these coping mechanisms which only work in the short term. But in the long term? It makes them only more miserable. That's why you must accept the truth no matter how ""harsh"" it may be, and improve your life for you accordingly. 




The reason of this post is to show you, do not rely  on the hope strategy. It will keep you nothing but in delusion. If you really want to make it happen, you have to go out there and make it happen and be practical about it. Do not live and fantasize in the dream world were you think everything will be ""perfect"" and ""fall into place."" Maybe in your dreams this happens, but not in the real world. This is just the reality of life. Life is practical, hoping is fiction. You have to work hard for what you really want and achieve. If you want to keep dreaming, then go back to sleep!",1648820969.0
138,How To Remain Positive Even After Getting Rejected By A Woman You Like,140,ttmr5c,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ttmr5c/how_to_remain_positive_even_after_getting/,61,"Let's be real, a lot of men wear their hearts on their sleeves.  This includes the Red Pill aware.  If you wear your heart on your sleeve, every time you get rejected, you feel crushed.  You thought that this girl was the one who would actually say yes.

I've written posts talking about rejection a lot and that I count my rejections, kinda like trophies.  I don't look at rejection as a negative.  I focus on making the approach and not bitching out.  I feel bad on days when I go out, see an attractive woman who I want to approach, but I don't.  I use that ""bitch out"" moment or day as a sign that I need to warm up before I start cold approaching again.  This is when I just socialize with random women.  I smile at old women, I'll have small talk with a couple of attractive women without trying to get their number.  I focus on increasing my interactions as a way to warm up to approaching women again and trying to get with them.

When you get rejected, by maintaining a positive outlook about it (you took action and approached and didn't bitch out), you take that positive energy into the next approach.  This positive energy feeds on itself and you'll notice that the women will enjoy talking to you.  Also, the fear of approaching women dwindles.  You may notice that as soon as you see an attractive woman, you'll approach her almost immediately.

""Enjoying rejection is a coping mechanism""

*Let's say you set a goal of approaching 1-2 women a day.  Your goal is to focus on making the approach, having a good interaction, be bold, solid, and confident, and only approach women you think are really attractive.  You aren't concerned about getting rejected or getting the girl.  Your only concern is taking action and having a good interaction with an attractive woman.*

*By having this mindset, you will start looking for attractive women everywhere you go.  You will look forward to going out talking to women and having good interactions.  You will make more attempts to get the number, go on dates, or hook up with the women you approach.  If you get rejected, you'll feel good that you made the attempt and look forward to the next approach.*

Trust me, if you get this mindset into your subconscious mind, it will become almost effortless approaching the women you want.

Remember  that cold approach is not about getting the girl in front of you.  It's about practice to find the women who shares mutual attraction and genuine desire for you.  The more you approach, and play the numbers game, the more likely you'll find them.

139,What is frame? An explanation,36,tttpyz,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/tttpyz/what_is_frame_an_explanation/,19,"Think of frame as a literal frame. Imagine a big frame made of wood then step inside it. Now that’s your frame. Everyone has their own frame made of wood that they’re inside. 

Improving your frame is the idea of getting good at making people enter your wooden frame and staying there. How you ask? Your a man that has achieved a lot and you genuinely know that you’re worth a lot so your frame is “I am the best” another girl when interacting with you has the frame” this guy is a loser” 

holding frame is when people try to convince you to get into their frame and believe what they believe. If you enter the girl’s frame then you agree that you’re a “loser”. If she gets into YOUR frame then she starts to believe that your “the best”.

How do you hold frame in reality?(you should also check the sidebar) 

Remember the the guy and the girl’s example above: 

If the girl for example says: “omg your such a loser look at those ugly shoes!”

The guys should for example agree and amplify(a tactic in the sidebar):”I know right? I just traded shoes with a homeless guy! Wanna trade shoes?”

By answering like this, you to take what the girl said as a joke. the girl’s frame was saying that you’re a loser which was not a joke(technically it’s a shit test read the sidebar), but you took what she said as a joke. If she starts laughing at your joke she entered your frame. if she doesn’t then she’s resisting entering your frame because frame is “the idea of making the other person believe what YOU want them to believe”.

guys can’t also try pull you into their frame for example: guy1 claims that he’s the best artist and guy2 says no I am the best artist. Both start debating who is the best artist some even bring out their outwork to compare if guy1 said you’re right your the better artist then guy1 entered guy2’s frame.

But it's all about Will and maybe some side discussion about Chris. Occasionally, there is some discussion about Jada and her ""entanglement.""

This is blatant pussy pass coupled with ""let's you and him fight over me"" with the end goal of an alpha widowed woman intentionally destroying the beta partner she loathes because he's a beta.

I'm glad to see there is some discussion about how Jada's affair led to, or at least contributed to, Will's incredibly stupid actions. But that totally misses what happened. Jada set Will up because she despises him.

Sunday was Will's night. He was a black man who was going to win a best lead actor Oscar for headlining a black led movie about a successful black family. Sunday was decades in the making. It was the feather in the cap of Will's career--decades of work. It was to be something for the black community. It was not a nod to a black person who kowtowed to white culture--it was the arrival of black culture.

And Jada could not fucking stand it. It curdled her to her core that the weak ass man was was being elevated and celebrated--and most infuriatingly of all--he was being elevated and celebrated above her. She could not accept that. So she flexed. She could not let Will have his moment. On that stage--with all eyes looking she A) showed that he was her bitch, because that how she sees their relationship, and B) she felt a visceral desire to point out to the world the emperor had no clothes. The world might think Will was great--but she knew he was pathetic and had to make sure the world knew too.

The result is that although Will won the most coveted academy award--all anyone is talking about is the Will-Jada relationship, which means they are talking about Jada.

And NOONE is calling her out on it. Not one person has said Jada should have shut Will up (I've seen one commenter say Will should have left it Jada to defend herself) or otherwise intervene. No, as a woman she could not have any authority over that situation despite clearly being able to exert absolute control over the man with nothing more than a frown and an eye-roll. It is classic pussy pass.

It's also classic let's you and him fight over me. That's crack to women. And it is ensuring she's in the headlines instead of it being just Will in the headlines. Instead of doing the congratulatory rounds on all the shows where Will is deservedly being lauded for his career, instead he's in hiding and Jada is the center of all the discussions.

And it is all because she despises him because he's weak. Will loves her despite fully knowing her heart belongs solely to Tupac. Hell their daughter wrote a letter to the dead man saying how she's sure he's alive and he needs to come get her and her mother so they can all finally be happy together as a family. That alone makes him revolting to her. She fucked a relative child in his house, in his bed, then MADE him go on record for it. He cried--she didn't. She didn't apologize, why should she when he's there the whole time saying he's her ride or die bitch. Will intended it to be a show of his strength--the cap of his masculinity. Jada meant for it to elevate her dim star at the humiliating expense of her husband, she clearly got off parading him as a cuck, and showed that he was fully on her leash. It was one of the most pathetic spectacles I have ever witnessed. And, it set up Sunday night. If he would promise his undying loyalty to her in response to her publicly exposing him as a cuck, she knew she could do anything with him at any time. She has fully consumed him and through him--his family, his work and his legacy.

Denzel is supposed to have told Will afterwards that in your highest moment is when the Devil comes for you. And he was correct. In Will's highest moment, Jada attacked and laid him low. The devil in a green dress. I really wonder if that is what Denzel was trying to tell him.

Men, protect yourself. Remember, if she thinks you are weak, it doesn't matter what you do for her--she will despise you, she will consume you, and will do what she an to destroy you. And above all, avoid the alpha widows.",1648686670.0
141,Orbiters attempt to sabotage relationship and how it backfired,252,tq97nj,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/tq97nj/orbiters_attempt_to_sabotage_relationship_and_how/,58,"TL;DR: Orbiter told girl I was being unfaithful/ had a load of attention from women in an attempt to put her off me, just resulted in making her want me more.

——————————————————-

Just wanted to share a recent experience of mine with my current girl and her orbiter friend.

Bit of a back story on myself: 

Been reading into and following TRP for the past year. Was interested in the idea when I first read into it as it highlighted a lot of the mistakes I was making with girls in the past. The more I dug the more it made sense and my relationships and sex life have significantly improved as a result. I’ve not really had any major issue getting laid as an adult, especially after getting a good 5 years of hard lifting/training under my belt. 

I have gotten pretty used to getting attention from women when I would be at a bar or club and that attitude allows me to start relationships easily. But, as time then goes on, I tend to stop making effort to engage with women, that abundance mentality fades and sure enough whoever I would be seeing would noticably become less attracted and eventually end it. This has basically the cycle over and over again for the past few years before discovering TRP. 

So anyways, fast forward to today: 

Been seeing this girl for about 4 months now. Going well, keeping it exclusive.

With regards to spinning plates: Ive tried it a few times, didn’t like it and to be honest it isn’t something Im gonna pursue. 

The other weekend, I went to a party she was holding for her birthday. Got there about 3/4h late because I was watching the Rugby with the boys in the afternoon. When I get there its all kicking off, everyones pretty drunk, especially the girl im seeing. 

Introduce myself to everyone, start getting the drinks in and all is going smooth. 

As the night goes on and I also get pretty drunk, it gets a bit weird between me and her for whatever reason and she is blatantly ignoring me. No idea why so I just let it slide and carried on enjoying myself. We head out to the club and im there with her friends, she blanks me again and I wasnt  really enjoying the club we were at. 

Thought fuck this, im not gonna just get ignored by this girl and stay in a club I dont like just cause I went to her birthday party. So me and one of her friends decide to up and go to a bar elsewhere. 

Get to the other bar, and started getting a load of attention from women and I was just lapping that shit up, hitting on girls left right and centre just cause I could. Didnt intend on fucking any of them, it was just playful flirting.

When im there with this guy, he starts saying shit like ‘you know I always look after [my girl], when we’re out’ and all that. Thought it was a bit weird but went with it. After cheekily asking for the shot girls number when she asked if we wanted anything else, this guy kicks off at me saying ive fucked up. Didnt think much of it, just responded with ‘not actually gonna do anything though, am I’ and left it there. 

Night goes on, my girl goes home with her room mate cause they were both drunk as fuck. I eventually get a taxi back to hers as thats where I was staying. 

The next day me and my girl are together, shes a bit mad that I fucked off but I just told her I aint just gonna stay there if shes ignoring me and I dont like the place.  

Didnt make much of a big deal about it and went out for lunch etc etc. 

Later that day the guy who I went with pops up to her telling her about how I was in the other bar, saying I had a tonne of attention from other women (30+ women he said, dunno where the fuck that number came from). Told her I was kissing other girls, calling [my girl] a slut and stuff. 

Wanna point out no kissing or slut calling happened. 

Then she gets all mad, I just told her the truth in that I was being a cheeky boy hitting on girls but didnt kiss anyone or call her a slut. 

Turns out this guy had told her he loves her in the past, real orbiter friend zone type. 

I told her shed just have to make a decision whether or not she believed me or him. She pretty much immediately chose to believe me and it just resulted in her wanting me more. The sex after that day has now gotten way nastier, like the idea of me having a tonne of attention from women has gotten her pussy all revved up.

Suppose the moral of this post and what I’ve learned is: Nothing makes a woman want a man more than knowing other women want that man. 

Best way to keep relationships going and the sex good is to put yourself in a position where other women want you. Or at least having her think other women want you.",1648473779.0

Whenever I see an image of Marjorie Taylor Greene or Lauren Boebert I am struck heavily with the ideation of wanting to just completely fuck the absolute hell out of them, and at the same time, really not knowing why this impulse is so strong.

This is really just puzzling to me. Public figures I think are sexually attractive are so much more conventional, like Natalie Portman or Jennifer Connelly, and with them it's just, kinda, yeah, I'd fuck 'em, whatever.

MTG and LB are not even what I would call sexually attractive. One is a very convincing Neanderthal, and the other has this weird chin thing that seems to have never been seen before Courtney Hole and Reese Witherspoon and is now all over the place.

When I see MTG I imagine putting both my hands on her face, right hand pinky and thumb digging into her temples and left hand on her mandible. Why so specific?

With LB, I have both hands on her throat, way up high where it doesn't hurt her. She keeps her glasses on the whole time.

In both cases, it is very intense and very loving and mutually satisifying.

These are two of the biggest idiots to appear in politics or anything for that matter, which is something that I can usually just ignore, but every time I see these two, I just get the biggest hostile boner, and with the above-mentioned specific imagery.

143,Know Thyself,28,tqbzw2,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/tqbzw2/know_thyself/,10,"*Disclaimer*

*I am not some perfect example of a man following the redpill path to the letter. Take everything here with a dump truck of salt until you have verified on your own. You are entitled to your own opinion based on your experience and knowledge.*

Introduction

First let's start with the title and how it relates. Know thyself is a shortened version of a quote from Socrates; ""To know thyself is the beginning of wisdom"".  Basically the majority of people out there do not seek wisdom because they never do enough introspection and analysis of one's own nature to consider it seeking wisdom. They seek knowledge, facts, data, information to be used, abused, and exploited.

I find that the majority of RP advice and literature out there that I have consumed for a decade (if not more) has always been watered down, boiled down, to some basic fundamental principles, acronyms and rules. Young men read them, follow the, see results, and never understand the why and the how. They simply reap the results from thousands of years of human knowledge and observation. If I act like this I get this, if I say this, I get this. Its a simple linear formula of approach more, get laid more. Its basic, and it works, and I do not argue that it is fundamentally, a-okay.

But getting older and having less fucks to give day by day, and less patience to put up with people who don't grow out of the loop of approach, lift, fuck, repeat, I have been going back to my roots and studying a lot of psychology and biology. Originally I was a med school major, but I never graduated, choosing to jump into a plethora of fields and having my own firm that doesn't even come close to medicine. But I decided to dig deep and combine philosophy, rp, with a whole bunch of new information about the human body and psyche.

Personality Theory

I would first really advise everyone who hasn't to really dig deep into yourself, and figure out how your personality works. Personality theory isn't the be all end all since the amount of genetic combinations is so vast it is nearly impossible to get a pure type. It is handy though to get a glimpse into how you function, as well as people in general. Fundamentally you have a hero function (the be all judge and jury of your mind, the final stopping point of all information), a parent function (the one that looks for data for living purposes that passes said data to the hero function), a child function (the function that is naive and spends a lot of its time making you think that you have it all figured out which constantly argues with the parent to convince the hero it is right), and an inferior function (the function that is the weakest link of your psyche commonly linked to your deepest insecurities).

I won't go into all the details, but if you look at personality functions (MBTI and/or Carl Jung's theories) these functions line up to the above paragraph. I will give an example. Let's say you are an INTJ (a typical engineer). A basic decode: the hero function is internal intuition, which internalizes and digests all information collected by the second (parent) function based on your own morality and ideology. The parent function being external thinking, meaning that you collect your data from the thoughts and logic of the people around you. Your child function is internal feeling, which being in the child slot, means your feelings are naive, over simplified, and don't take into consideration external factors. And your inferior function is external sensing, which makes your insecurity, the fear of new experiences and the unknown physical world (usually manifests in the inability to physically leave your comfort zone and subconscious slavery to one's parents).

Philosophy

I very much dislike the term philosophy and its associated stereotypes. A lot of philosophy is associated with a bunch of old farts pretending to be deep thinkers and never really doing anything. But I would like to remind you that some of the greatest philosophical works were written by emperors.

I can advise for you to read a whole bunch of philosophical works, but honestly, its up to you. Some of them can be quite a drag, but not for me. I will advise you stay away from philosophers who focus too much on arguing about religion and/or spirituality as this is an honest waste of brain function. Again, since the definition of philosophy is the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, wasting time arguing about if God's exist or not productive. Stick to stoics for now.

Fundamentally, understanding why you think about what you think about, why you do what you do, and digging deep into yourself and giving honest answers is fundamental to growth.

I do not mean this in a way that if all you want is to fuck good pussy then you need some deeper meaning. It really doesn't matter, claim it to be a biological need or emotional, it really is up to you. I just never wanted to dilute myself into a mindless slave of any system, and the red pill is just another system of living. Imagine, blue balled fucks are completely okay with their existence and even consider it to be the norm, and unless they think about it critically with no predisposition to right or wrong, they will continue to live the way they do, and judging them is essentially pointless since they simply follow the one and only system they have ever tried.

At least to me, TRP, the red pill, signifies truth and answering truthfully to everything, especially sex.

Biology

There are some very simple biological processes that explain the majority of why things happen the way they do in our lives. Why do men change when they get married? Because the hunter has caught its prey? Maybe, but at least from a biological perspective, a single male's sympathetic nervous system has to go from keeping itself alive and doing the bare minimum, to taking into consideration anther biological being and all the responsibilities there of. Why do women seem to always be airheads and can't think past their own nose? Because they take the path of least resistance to acquire the desired dopamine response. This is why modern men, are actually women! Because they have been reprogrammed to do the same through the use of the internet. If the only way to achieve a greater dopamine high after becoming royally numb to watching other people get married is to get married yourself, then that is what a woman will aim for.

Heck, even post nut clarity is more than just a myth. When you cum and your sexual hormones subside, you are left with an abundance of oxygen and adrenaline, which in combination puts your brain in to an awake, almost espresso like state, stimulating the sympathetic nervous system to be prepared to fight or run. 

Aiming to understand how our body works, especially your specific body, is just common sense. Every person is slightly different and understanding how to maximize your body's potential is crucial. I had a friend one time, who pretty much couldn't sleep normally, no matter how hard he tried, and would end up being horribly depressed and unproductive. After a ton of digging (this was years ago) he devised a schedule, where he would go to sleep 2 hours ahead, every day, for a year. To figure this out, he stayed away until he no longer could and went to sleep, recorded the time (lets say 9pm), that meant the next day he would go to sleep at 11pm, and then 1am, and so on. I have never seen someone be so productive sleeping for only 5 hours a day. To this day he works 2 full time senior developer jobs and make's nearly 400k USD a year and still has time to party. Its wild but that was his biological method of maximizing his potential.

TLDR:

Understand the psyche, understand the reasoning, understand the biology. Keep learning.",1648481702.0
144,Women are the gatekeepers of sex. Men are the gatekeepers of commitment.,261,ton9ld,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ton9ld/women_are_the_gatekeepers_of_sex_men_are_the/,65,"[https://rattibha.com/thread/1429159371917889539?lang=en](https://rattibha.com/thread/1429159371917889539?lang=en) 

I found this very interesting reading and wanted to share this Redpill with you.

""Women are the gatekeepers of sex. Men are the gatekeepers of commitment. They both want what each other has so they engage in an intersexual trade by barter;  A situation where women use sex to secure commitment and men use commitment to secure sex.

This is why common men say ""I want you to be my girlfriend"" when they really mean ""I want to fuck you"" and women agree to have sex and then ask ""so what are we now?"" afterward.  The latter uses commitment as bait to get sex and the former uses sex as bait to get commitment.

Women or at least, women with high standards, understand this fundamental inter-sexual dynamic and practice it as a matter of expedience.  This is why despite the countless men across different social media networks in a pretty girl's DM, she only agrees to fuck the best of them

And the best of them in this case are those who in her estimation, are most likely to provide her commitment among other things.  It is her duty to ensure the effectiveness of her vetting process so that she doesn't get cheated in this intersexual trade-by-barter.

The more successful her filtration process is the higher value she is and the better she feels about herself for getting a (high-value) man to commit to her.  It is for this reason that the wedding day is the highlight of the lives of most traditional women..

As they've finally gotten a man to make the greatest commitment to them.  Women have an extensive understanding of this basic principle by default. Men? not so much.  And this is one area where a man should copy women and be uncompromising in vetting the women he commits to.

Or better still, avoid committing to any woman unless he finds someone worthy.  This is even more important in today's femcentric world where the feminine imperative is prevalent. Thus, a woman who employs a resolute vetting process in deciding who she fucks is considered...

decent and praised.  But a man who utilizes an uncompromising filtration process in vetting who he commits to is called a commitment-phobe and shamed.  A woman who is wary about having sex is celebrated. A man who is wary about committing is insulted.

So today's femcentric world encourages men to commit to just about any woman whilst giving women the exclusive social right to be picky and fuck only the best of men.  It is hypocritical that the person who is skeptical about giving up what they have...

Is shaming another person for doing the same thing.  This dishonesty is even more blatant when you consider that commitment is a lot more valuable than sex and a sex-for-commitment exchange is a bad deal for the person who's providing commitment.

Men get sex with money, by driving a car or by owning an iPhone. Heck! In school, we got sex because we owned an I-pass-my-neighbour generator.  Women will give sex in exchange for shawarma and it's considered normal. Have you seen a man commit to a woman because she was...

driving a car, owned an iPhone or bought him shawarma? If you did see such a man, what would you think of him?  Every man should, as a matter of principle, be a commitment-phobe. Just as women are wary about having sex, you should be extra wary about committing.

You have a commodity that is rare and in high demand and so you should be very circumspect about who you give it to if you decide to give it to anyone.  Do not let emotional rapists shame you into giving it up with their hackneyed manipulation tactics.

No one shames women for refusing to fuck or saving their coochie for the 'right man' so don't let them shame you for refusing to commit or saving your commitment for the 'right woman.'  When you consider all these and realize you hold all the cards and the sex...

a woman gives in exchange is not commensurate to the commitment you can offer, you'll have one more reason to guard it.  You can offer money, or Shawarma in exchange for sex. Women will take it and thank you. What you should not do is offer your precious and valuable...

commitment in exchange for something as dirt cheap and common as sex. That is a very bad deal for you.  So be a commitment-phobe. Your mental health and children will thank you.  Pass this on. Save a man""",1648296911.0

One thing I have realised since decades back getting into the PUA scene, is that lot of young men lack social skills. The Mystery method era that could be faked with memorising lines and jestermaxx, but that's not going to fly in this modern tech age. 


The sad thing, and what prompted me to post this, is that im currently seeing dating coaches charging courses for thousands of dollars trying to teach young men that, when in reality that is a skill you could pick up by trying to join a hobby.

146,Before You Cold Approach--Warm-Up Exercises To Start Cold Approaching,121,tnc4mu,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/tnc4mu/before_you_cold_approachwarmup_exercises_to_start/,37,"There are some of you who want to dip your toes into cold approaching, but you have a fear of getting rejected repeatedly.  Here's an exercise you can do to help you start cold approaching where you are asking for a woman's number with the intent to hook-up and/or go on dates.

If you're in a state of anxiety, because you fear the rejection, you need to lighten up.  You don't want to link cold approaching with anxiety, but with fun.  There's an exercise you can do that will get you into a social psychological and physiological sate where you are actually enjoying these interactions... even if you get rejected.

Your first approach should  be a warm-up.  You can either go in for the direct approach and ask for a woman's number (feel the fear and do it) or you can just have a bunch of interactions with some attractive women.  No pressure, just go up and talk to her about anything related to the situation.

For example:

*You're at the supermarket and you see a woman who looks like she's trying to make a buying decision*

You: ""Pick the left one.  I love lasagna.""

Her: ""You read my mind""

You: ""Glad I can help""

Keep in mind that it's a warm-up, so you're not trying to get the girl's number.  You're trying to get into a mental and physiological state to where you feel comfortable talking to attractive women you want to get with.  After doing this a few times, you're gonna see a very attractive woman and you're gonna feel more confident talking to her because you had about 3-5 interactions with attractive women.

This is an old day game trick that you can use throughout the day.  The women don't even have to be hot.  Mr. Locario did a video called *You Should Be Talking To 25 Women A Day* on YouTube.  This includes online and IRL.  A simple ""hello"" counts.  A philosophy I have is ""It's not about getting the girl, but having the power to get women"".  This exercise will help you get that power.  Don't worry about ""missing opportunities"".  You'll have tons of opportunities to meet new, hotter women, and by doing this exercise, you'll be ready to shoot your shot with much more confidence.

147,"On The ""Buyer vs. Seller"" Frame",67,tl4lhs,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/tl4lhs/on_the_buyer_vs_seller_frame/,40,"Imagine with me for a moment what it is like to be the type of person that walks into a social venue and whose Modus Operandi is thinking “*Who am I going to choose tonight?*” I mean to oppose this hypothetical with someone I used to be, and probably still am to a certain extent: naturally introverted, stifled, the whole nine yards – you know how it goes I’m sure (and if you don’t then god bless you). For myself, this thought experiment is quite the paradigm shift; simply for the fact that it is not what I am predominantly thinking while going out.

*Enough about me though.* Let’s flesh this out. Imagine being that person that goes into an environment with that **proactive mentality of not having to battle and wrestle with the inner- and outer-perceived enemies of anguish and threat**. Imagine not having your self worth wrapped up in rejection because of **a perfectly rational, objective outlook on life**. And then, if someone did 'reject' you, because you are so **consciously aware of how great and fun and cool you and your life are**, I mean in a very objective cold hard economic sense, **you would just pity the girl for missing out**. Again, this is not because you developed a spite for the girl because you got [black pilled by statistics on reproductive success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjAv5XhK8Xo) and you are still coping, but rather because your identity, the way you habitually think about yourself, is not predicated on what another, fairly ignorant on the subject, person thinks about you in the singular moment. Imagine the power of that foundation which was built up quite *logically and deliberately*. *This is how I make sense of the “Buyer vs. Seller” Frame*.

And of course, this is a perfectly plausible life scenario but I want to talk a little bit more about this frame. My education in this sphere of life comes from old school RSDTyler and RSDJulien videos, Pook, and the red pill subreddit. I remember a Julien video about this topic where he tried to convey the frame as 'going to Best Buy to shop for a TV'. I don’t know... that didn’t really explain shit to me so I sort of ignored the idea. But recently, *because I do go out every weekend*, the idea reemerged to the front of my mind.

For quite some time, I have been pondering what the hell to look for in a girl. **Genuinely I have asked this question to many people and I have not yet gotten any satisfying answers.** Mostly it is about her being DTF and having good logistics and so on. To be honest, I don’t really give a fuck about fucking although I can not lie that it is enjoyable. I am looking for something more than this and quite frankly I am a blank slate when it comes to answering the question. **Why do you want a girl? What does a girl bring to your life? Is this even the right question to ask?** Of course, central to philosophy is the idea that [not only are there wrong answers but, even more importantly, there are wrong questions](https://youtu.be/oOKlqdP8e14?t=30).

So this has been where I am at for some time now. **What are you looking for? What are you screening for? What does that mean when a woman is “good enough” for you? What do you want out of a woman?**

*Back to picking up chicks*: the significant thing about “being the Buyer and not the Seller” is not that the Frame makes your game better, which it certainly can – that’s just a side effect – but rather **what is significant is that being the Seller just fucking sucks**, ya know? For one, it eats up all this energy trying to impress others. But besides that, like, who are you trying to sell yourself to? These dumb women? What do you even want to sell yourself to these women for? Does anyone have a clear answer on this? **Are we all just following this biological hypnosis of want for pussy?** What I mean to emphasize is that not only does being the Seller make you into a Pussy and women won’t want to fuck you, but, *even more importantly, why would you even want the woman in the first place*? Don’t just sell to anyone. And coming from this place of authentic ignorance and curiosity, **you flip the Seller frame into the Buyer frame by practicing genuine discretion in your offer**. Who would you even want to sell to? Who would you even want to offer your experience to? *I genuinely do not have a satisfying answer.*

*One final note*: I am really not trying to be a 'cool guy' or uphold some sort of persona or anything like that. **I am literally just a guy in the world** – nothing that special. I mean, I think I am pretty cool and smart and fun and socially aware of course, but bottom line I am just a fucking guy that’s trying to figure this shit out because it didn’t make sense to me. Aren’t we all just trying to figure this shit out? I genuinely think I have done pretty well and that people would want to read and hear what I have to say in this regard but I really do see myself as some regular guy. And yes I know that this is such a tired fucking take at this point in the internet democratic education of game and social skills.

I literally just want to be empathetic and understand other people’s perspectives or, [as Pook puts it, 'contexts'](https://dapook.blogspot.com/2006/08/information-age-is-about-context-not.html) because I know this is highly conducive to finding the better ways of living and getting what you want.",1648058795.0

149,How To Get Into State When You Socialize (Actionable Advice),156,tjcgne,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/tjcgne/how_to_get_into_state_when_you_socialize/,15,"If you are anything like me, you know that going out to socialize with strangers (or to pick up chicks) in a venue can be either the best thing in the world or the worst thing in the world. One night you can be **On Top Of The Fucking World** and another night you could feel yourself *wishing to retreat back to the womb from which you came*.

After a bit of maturation and acclimatization to the nightclub environment, you should have figured out that **getting into State, i.e. getting in the zone, having a good time, loosening up, letting go, becoming “un-stifled”, activating your brain’s Winner Effect, achieving this higher state of Being is predicated (almost) entirely on your own actions**. This is the main lesson of the RSD of old: “*Action is King*”.

Okay. This is all well and good. But I have something deeper and more powerful.

Once upon a time, I would need to get a positive reaction in order to get into State because that was just how my green and naive brain worked at the time. The reason for my action taking was in order to get this positive reaction and if I didn’t get it, I would just be **DRAINED** from forcing myself so hard out of my natural introversion.

**This is how I broke out of this unreliable vicious cycle**. Now, I can talk to anyone and get into State.

*You have to understand that State is a matter of “letting go”.*

# Letting go of what? Tension.

**And with this bodily tension comes the flood of mental anguish, social anxiety, self judgment, and pessimism associated with being stifled and stuck in your head.** For some, such my former self, this is your everyday life.

So here is how you can get into state anytime and anywhere...

Whenever I am speaking to someone, **I place my focus into my body and into relaxing it so my brain can function properly.**

When I walk around the world, I find myself creating unconscious tension. For example, when in the gym, I will unconsciously suck in my stomach so that my waist seems smaller. This is due to some ideal image in my brain I presume. It is not until I actively relax my body that I realize that I was unconsciously sucking in my gut. This is probably just the tip of the iceberg too. Anyways, I am confident this unnecessary somatic tension exists in your own body as well and is a dominating cause of your severe social anxiety and mental anguish. *This tension is a sign that you are* ***Trying Too Hard***.

**All you have to do to solve this habitual hell is take extensive alone time to meditate, be with yourself, and release the somatic tension in your body and become acquainted with that relaxed feeling.** Then, once you’ve found it, try walking around with conscious focus on releasing that tension. Then try relaxing while speaking with others. You’ll see that different environments engender differing levels of stress in your body and will require differing levels of conscious relaxation. Eventually, as you practice this awareness, you will come to see that this physical tension was causing a lot of mental grief and inhibiting your natural social expressiveness. Every time you practice this active meditation, it will become easier and easier. [This is how you enter the flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ).

151,Why Day Game Is A Good Way To Increase Your Chances Of Getting Women,66,tip9ut,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/tip9ut/why_day_game_is_a_good_way_to_increase_your/,23,"Men who do day game and cold approach have a high level of confidence compared to men who don't.  Not because they're special, but because they got a lot of practice interacting with women.  They may have started out timid and shy, but after approaching hundreds or even thousands of women, they feel like they're in their element.  Just like anything you do over time, you get better at it.  It may have taken them 100 women just to get a phone number and a date their first year, but after so many approaches and self-improvement, it may only take 20 approaches to get one woman.

Some of you use dating apps and realize that the women on those apps are spoiled for choice.  The vast majority of people who use dating apps are men.  This means that you may have the advantage approaching women in the real world.  If a woman is going by a man's picture on a dating app, all the dudes who look like male models are gonna get a lot of matches.  However, if you meet those same women on the streets and ask them out on a date, they'll be more willing to go... even though you may be average-looking.  Why?  Because she met you in real life and she can FEEL you out better than by going off of a picture and some text in the bio.

""I'm afraid of rejection.  With dating apps, the rejection is minimal""

I learned something over the months of cold approach and that is, taking rejection and patience is the foundation to a happy dating life.  As long as you can take rejection after rejection and you have the patience to stick it out, eventually women will start saying yes.  If you lose a woman for whatever reason, all you have to do is cold approach and repeat the process.

It sounds like hell to keep getting rejected, but when you learn that it's part of the process to get the women you want, you will want to get rejected as quickly as possible to find the women you want as quickly as possible.

*Let's say someone pre-screened 500 women.  They showed these women a video of you doing your normal thing.  In other words, the video was not you trying to get chosen by the group like you would see on some of these dating shows back in the early 2000s like the ones on MTV.  It was just a video of you interacting with friends and having fun.  The group of women were asked who would sleep with you and 5 women rose their hands.  Each of these 5 women were put into 5 separate rooms.  Each of these rooms had 100 women in total, but only one woman would sleep with you.  Now, lets say  you were told that if you enter each of these rooms, one woman out of 100 was down to fuck.  Would you play the numbers game and approach each woman in the room, knowing that you would get laid guaranteed?  How quickly would you try to move through each room to find each woman who wants to sleep with you?  How long would it take for you to find each of those women in each room?*

When you do day game and cold approaching on a regular basis, you have an understanding that you are gonna have ""a room full"" of women who are not sexually attracted to you.  Your job is to find the ones who are and focus on finding them, not dwelling on all the rejection you've received along the way.  Unlike our room experiment in the previous paragraph, we have no guarantees of a woman being attracted to us in any given venue on any given day. All we can do is keep approaching until we find her.

152,Alpha Mindset of a Winner,67,tfyyo3,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/tfyyo3/alpha_mindset_of_a_winner/,14,"A alpha doesnt dwell in the past and a alpha isn't worried about the future. He lives his life in the now, the moment. The genuine sacred moment which is now. 

A book I like that helps you bring yourself into the moment is ""The Power of Now"".

I'm curious if anyone here has anything better or let alone brilliant advice as to truly capture the wonderfulness of the moment and truly adopt an alpha Mindset.

Lots of blue pill people are so beta they live in the past crying with sadness. Worrying if there actions hurt women or if there actions lived up to their perfect life assumption of a blue piller. The alpha lives in the moment and is very lucrative of what is going on. 

Now it isn't impossible for a blue piller to reach such mindset. Simple meditations and just focusing on where your thoughts go is a useful tool to just just self analyze yourself. When you think of your life throughout the day you begin to remember and pay attention to where a majority of your thoughts go. You then learn intricate new things about your life that sort of opens you up into a new world of possibilities. The science is breath taking and the new discovery of individualism is so profound that it almost becomes an addiction. What is the majority of your thoughts in a 24hr day? They might include random stuff your worried about and that in a way is causation for problems within itself. 


Now one thing I find interesting is I often get bored in the now. It's like okay I'm present now what? As if I am addicted to my thoughts and get rewards for thinking and nothing happens when I stay in the now. The present moment becomes nothing more than the present moment and I just need more. 

But the now is more than just the present moment. Think of all the life events we missed because we where worried about something that doesn't make sense to be worried about. The present moment is filled with many joys and wonders and it's an amazing place to develop your brain even though it is hard to stay present.

Some people might think that this is more for a meditation subreddit but it might not be. Do you feel after taking the very bitter red pill have you found your mindset to be more in the present moment? How does that moment feel when you have a better strong sense of individualism and now you can ""see"". 

One red pill topic that applies to being in the moment and alpha Mindset is narcissism. When we love are selfs I find that it makes us automatically bring us into the moment. Largely because when we become content with who we are then we find happiness and joy in the present moment making it less boring to stay in the present. Now there are dangers to narcissism as it may make you delusional but at the same time narcissism is better then finding reasons not to like yourself. 


So what do you think of an Alphas mindset? It's like microscoping the thoughts of an alpha. Noticing patterns and learning like as if he was your father.",1647481639.0
153,The New Model Of Closing Women On Sex: How To Overcome Objections And Go From Intermediate To Advanced In 2022,121,tfso8d,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/tfso8d/the_new_model_of_closing_women_on_sex_how_to/,28,"# Intro:

You’ve been working out for a while, working on yourself

… And women are starting to notice…

You’re starting to get matches on tinder, you’re starting to have enough confidence to cold approach women at the bar when you go out with your friends…

You may even be getting semi-consistent dates.

But more often than not, when it’s time to take the next step… you encounter resistance.

When it’s time to move a girl out of the club and into another venue or better yet, back to your place, you encounter the “I have to get back to my friends” line.

When it’s time to bring a woman home for sex after a hot date where you’ve been escalating smoothly the entire time… she throws out an objection. “I don’t know you well enough yet” or “I have to meet a friend”.

And this seems to happen even if you’re making out with the girl on the date!

Has this ever happened to you?

Incredibly frustrating isn’t it?

If you care less about what other people think than average, you come to the conclusion that “It’s just a numbers game” and go with a psychopathic “gotta talk to more girls and not care about rejection because that’s just what it takes to get what I want” approach.

If you care more about what other people think than average, the self doubt creeps in and you start to wonder if maybe you’re just not good looking enough to consistently close the deal…

So What’s The Solution?

# The Problem With What 80-90% of Guys Do When They Encounter Resistance:

When I first started out learning game years ago, I did what 80-90% of guys do when they encounter objections from the girl:

Not even bother trying to overcome them.

If they said they were too tired, I would simply say “I understand” and give up right then and there.

And after that, I may see her again, but more often than not, I wouldn’t see her again.

There’s so many things that could happen between the 1st and 2nd Date that would result in you never seeing the girl again.

She might meet another guy she’s interested in at work or school

She might be having a bad week

She might be dealing with too much stress from drama from her best friend

She might have woken up on the wrong side of bed…

You get the point.

And that’s when I noticed something.

Every girl I ever fucked was super into me from the very beginning. These would be the “Fuck Yeah” girls that Uncle Vas and various others have explained in their posts.

For the “Maybe” Girls, my close rate for actual sex, not just make outs, was 0%.

I found myself thinking, “honestly, it’s just a big numbers game. All I have to do is approach more women to screen for the women who are super into me from the beginning.”

The problem with this line of thinking is, from my personal experience, and the experience of many of my close friends who approached women with a similar mindset, you tend to get women lower value than you.

*Well duh… you gotta raise your value then! Lift moar! Make moar money! Moar social skillz!*

I’m firmly of the opinion that most people on RedPill already know that you should be doing all these things to increase your SMV.

So simply stating, “You gotta raise your SMV” over and over doesn’t really help someone who’s already doing all those things but simply needs more time to bring his SMV to the top 10-20%.

I believe that there’s no reason you can’t work on your own value AT THE SAME TIME that you get actual results with women. You don’t have to wait until you’re 30 with a 315lb bench, figure salary, and years of therapy to clear out mental trauma before you can even THINK about getting girls. That would mean missing out on meaningful experiences with girls in your teens/20’s.

Therefore, I approached it from a different angle.

I started being a Wolf of Wall Street type Closer and “refused” to take No for an answer whenever a girl gave me an objection.

# The Problem With Hard Closing:

This is more or less what I was doing as a “Hard Closer”. I would pump myself up and make myself sound as confident and absolutely certain as possible while closing.

***Hard Closer***\*: “I know this awesome bar we should go to right now. Come on let’s go”\*

***Girl***\*: “I’d love to! But I have an early morning tomorrow…”\*

***Hard Closer*** \*: “I hear what you’re saying. But does the idea sound fun to you? Do you like the idea?\*

***Girl***\*: “Well yes… but I have to get to work early tomorrow for a Monday morning meeting…”\*

***Hard Closer*** \*: “I get where you’re coming from. So you don’t want to go to work late on Monday?”\*

***Girl***\*: “No”\*

***Hard Closer*** \*: “You don’t wanna get fired huh?”\*

***Girl***\*: “No”\*

***Hard Closer*** \*: “And what you’re saying is even if I promise we’re only gonna hang out for 20 minutes and after that I kick you out and force you to go back home, there’s absolutely no chance you’re gonna get to work on time on Monday?”\*

***Girl***\*: “Well… no”\*

***Hard Closer*** \*: “Then what are we waiting for? Come on, let’s go!”\*

***Girl***\*: “Uh… I really can’t…. sorry!”\*

My entire goal was to simply keep overcoming objection after objection until the girl “submits” and just agrees to do what I want her to do.

And while this converted at higher rates than simply agreeing with the girl’s objection and not even putting up a fight, I noticed that:

1. I’d often have to loop the girl 3-4 times before she finally “gives up” and…
2. I still had a hard time actually closing the hottest girls. This would lead to much higher success rates with lower SMV women who were on the fence but it would rarely work with higher value women.

Worst of all, I wasn’t really able to transfer this skillset to others who came to me for advice.

I taught them this Wolf Of Wall Street style closing, but almost no one had the confidence to pull it off consistently.

I realized that something needed to change.

# Younger Women Simply Don’t Trust Fuckbois & Players As Much As Previous Generations:

I recently read an article on Forbes [that Gen-Z are less trusting than any generation in US History](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelstone/2021/05/18/gen-z-they-crave-stability-and-trust-so-give-it-to-them/?sh=77fba3f7594a).

This is all speculation but I’m starting to suspect that on a subconscious level, this new generation of girls coming up have seen what the results of uncontrolled hypergamy and cock carousel riding have done to the previous generation of millennial women…

And they wish to avoid making those same mistakes.

With the rise of FDS and other “female sexual strategy” subreddits, I’m starting to realize that gradually, women seem to be more and more aware that getting pumped and dumped lowers their sexual market value.

Not saying every younger girl is like this, but overall, they seem to be more resistant to “hard closing” techniques than past generations of women.

Not saying every younger generation girl is like this but for the most part, it seems like pressure is NOT the optimal way to overcome their objections.

They seem to be able to sniff out when a guy is only interested in sex, even if he passes all the SMV checks.

So now the question becomes, “How do I overcome a girl’s objections and actually lead her to sex when she’s probably aware of my motives and resists because on a deeper level, even if she finds me attractive, she doesn’t want to get pumped and dumped?”

In other words: “How do I make her trust me?” – regardless of whether or not my actual intentions really are to just hit it and quit it lol

# The New Model Of Closing in 2022:

I got to work crafting a new strategy by testing out various things on the field until I came to a semi-workable solution.

Here’s what I discovered:

You absolutely do NOT want to sound too confident when you’re actually closing a woman. Of course, in the beginning you should be speaking in a loud, slow, confident voice with zero uptalk tonality, but it seems like when it’s actually time to close…

Having a super confident vocal tonality only seems to trigger resistance.

Women these days seem like they’re able to sense that when you sound too confident when it’s time to close, it’s coming from the wrong place (either tons of practice or natural psychopathic/narcissistic traits)

So the solution is to purposely avoid practicing your delivery too much and just sound “natural” when it’s time to close. That doesn’t mean you purposely try to sound less confident but you definitely don’t want to go overboard with pumping yourself up before you close.

***Hard Closer***\*: “I know this awesome bar we should go to right now. Come on let’s go”\* (delivered in a super confident tonality)

***Next Gen Closer\****: “I know this awesome bar that just opened up. They have this \[new drink or food\]. What do you think?” (delivered in a very natural conversational tone of voice)

By simply delivering my close in a “natural” easygoing conversational tone of voice as opposed to a super confident tone, I noticed that my closing rate immediately went up.

The key is to not even think about the result. You should have the mindset that you’re going to check out this new place with or without the girl. You’re simply telling her about the opportunity and letting her make a decision on whether or not she wants to come along.

A lot of times, just by sounding natural, the girl will follow you!

But just in case she throws out an objection, I created several more steps that are specifically designed to overcome her resistance in a more natural way instead of triggering alarm bells of “pump and dump” in her head.

At first glance, some of this will seem like it goes against every single Tenet of RedPill in that some of these tactics seem Beta at first glance, but make no mistake, if all you care about is the result (sex), it’s far more effective to temporarily show her a Beta side of you to gain her trust than to maintain Alpha frame the entire time and try to pressure her into sex over and over again until she submits.

**Example of Resistance:**

***Girl***\*: “I’d love to! But I have a meet a friend…”\*

***Next Gen Closer\****: “That’s not a problem. If you don't mind me asking, what do you mean by meet a friend”? (delivered in a caring, empathetic tone of voice)

You always ask them “What do you mean by….. \[whatever objection they throw at you\]”, because you want to gather more information before you go on the attack. They will almost always elaborate further as long as you sound like you genuinely care about them while you say this.

“Meet a friend” could mean meeting a long lost friend from College that’s only in town for the weekend, it could also mean meeting a regular friend that she sees almost every day that wouldn’t really care that much if she missed one meeting. It could also mean she doesn’t quite trust you enough to take that next step.

The point is, by simply asking them to clarify, you get more information as to what’s really behind their objection.

***Girl***\*: “My friend from work wants to meet me in half an hour…”\*

***Next Gen Closer\****: “I can appreciate that. So if you didn’t have to meet this friend from work, does my idea sound fun? (delivered in a caring, empathetic tone of voice)

And at this point, if you did everything else right, the girl will almost always say **“Yes!”**

And here’s where instead of going for the “kill” and saying, “EXACTLY, THAT’S WHY WE SHOULD GO! COME ON FOLLOW ME!” you’re going to separate yourself from every other guy by pulling back a bit and getting her to “Sell” herself on the idea of going to the bar with you.

***Next Gen Closer\****: “Well… why do you think it is though?” (delivered in a slightly skeptical tone)

If you do this correctly, it should seem like you’re Disqualifying your own idea!

Very few things build trust faster than when you appear like you really don’t just have your own interests at heart and at least on the surface, seem to actively work against your own best interest.

At this point, the girl will literally start SELLING HERSELF on the idea of going to the bar with you!

***Girl***\*: “Well, I always like being one of the first ones to go to openings because I know they always have cool specials… I love exploring new places”\*

The key is that this is A LOT MORE POWERFUL than if you were to tell the girl all these things because she honestly believes that it’s HER IDEA, even though you were the one who led her to this conclusion lol.

***Next Gen Closer\****: “I see… What do you think we should do then? Any way we can work together and figure this out?” (delivered in a caring, empathetic tone of voice)

And this is where you position yourself as her PARTNER, instead of her adversary. You’re here to “figure this out together”, not to force her into your way of thinking.

A lot of times, the girl will come up with her own ways around her OWN OBJECTION!

***Girl***\*: “That won’t be a problem, I’ll just text my friend to reschedule”

You will be shocked how often this happens if you genuinely sound like a kind, caring person (slightly beta) in your delivery at this crucial closing step.

In case she can’t quite figure it out, this is less than ideal, but you can always make “suggestions” to try to lead her towards what you want.

***Next Gen Closer\****: “Do you mind if I make a suggestion real quick?” (delivered in a caring, empathetic tone of voice).

***Girl***\*: “Sure”

***Next Gen Closer\****: “What if you texted your friend to reschedule? Would that help by any chance?” (delivered in a caring, empathetic tone of voice).

***Girl***\*: “Yeah!”

And you keep doing this over and over again until she closes.

***Next Gen Closer\****: “What if we did it like this? \[Then make another suggestion\] (delivered in a caring, empathetic tone of voice).

# Conclusion:

And that’s the new model of closing.

Women are less trusting, more careful than before, so it’s time to adapt.

I feel like virtually NOBODY else is doing this so whoever adopts it will have an enormous advantage over the competition.

Like I said before, 80-90% of guys don’t even have the balls to try to overcome the objection in the first place…

And the rest of them just sound like pushy used car salesman or stockbrokers using outdated techniques that only trigger further resistance in these women.

I would say that less than 1% of guys have the knowledge you now have.

So what are you waiting for?

Time to close those “Maybe” girls and go from Intermediate to Advanced.

Time to get out of the Rat Race of “it’s all a numbers game” for good (or at least until women start picking up on this new strategy lol)

Good luck out there and happy closing!",1647463446.0
154,Belief War,18,tfsj01,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/tfsj01/belief_war/,4,"Hello everyone, today I'd like to the discuss the nature of a war which goes on much more subtlety than most are cognizant of. While I will speak solely from my own experience and understanding, I would like to open up the discussion for other strategies and ways we can better prepare ourselves.

&#x200B;

The sort of mental warfare I'm referring to occurs much like chinese water torture yet its subtlety is what makes it so easy to overlook . It takes place in our daily interactions and is made by and large by the majority of people. At the most basic level, what I am going to try to describe relates to the power of belief as well as our own and other people's beliefs.

&#x200B;

In our own lives, the most powerful beliefs are our own. Outside of that is everyone else's beliefs. While there are far more types of beliefs than I will mention, some of the ones I've observed to be the most influential in a person's life are their fears, their desires, what they believe is right as well as wrong. If we lived in a perfect world, all of those things would be clear as day and universally aligned but unfortunately, we don't.

&#x200B;

Now before I go on any further I can already hear some of you thinking ""who gives a shit bruh, why does it even matter what anyone else thinks or believes?"". If I don't give a shit what anyone thinks then I would obviously never pay attention to what they think, say, or believe because I simply don't care. I guess that's it, problem solved right? If you firmly believe this is the solution then I'm sure your life living alone in a cabin in the mountains will be just fine. But for most of us, we're not hermits nor misanthropes and we do still want to still participate in society, we just don't want to have our energy exposed to spergs with shit belief systems who are much like holes to a ship- our ship. The longer you are surrounded by people with negative mindsets (complain, lazy, no goals, etc.). the more it will wear down your own energy and drive. Who succeeds being surrounded by losers?  

&#x200B;

Let's break down the following into 3 major social groups with which their exposure to us can influence our lives- our friends, our family, and acquaintances/strangers. 

&#x200B;

My idea of friends is something very close and tightly knit. The idea is to keep around those with good, authentic energy that also happen to benefit to your growth/improvement/well-being. Unfortunately, it is only after we find out that certain ones were shit that they no longer fit that category. The beliefs of friends is something most tend to hold dearly and trust but once again they still hold weight when toe to toe to our own beliefs therefore vying its significance. Always be vigilant of who you call a friend, keep your circle verified from first hand experience.

&#x200B;

Next is our family. We all have a mom and dad, no denying that much. Whether we have a relationship, had a relationship, or never even had one with them at all, there is no way to avoid the weight it holds on our belief system. Someone was there to raise us, *or someone wasn't*. These experiences inescapably led us towards deeply ingrained beliefs which ultimately affect your destiny and the path you set forward for yourself. I believe your destiny is all up to you, that's just my personal belief but my point is to **not overlook nor discredit these other sources of influence as they've shaped and will continue to be a part of the shaping of your perception and furthermore your beliefs.**

&#x200B;

Lastly, we have the people you'd expect to have the least amount of influence in your life (and maybe they do) but let's put the strangers you meet maybe once and never again along with those people that you'd consider just acquaintances. Their beliefs displayed in a day to day interaction are the simplest and most naturally occurring evidence of what I began this post about. What you say, what you think, and what you do is all a reflection of your beliefs. You can't filter out people you have yet to meet (including even by chance) or in other circumstances where it may be required of you to work with them met or if you barely even know them but when the time comes, your beliefs will be revealed in whatever it is in the interaction that you shared, as will theirs. The beliefs which do not align will become evident while inversely confirming the others that they believe as well. 

&#x200B;

The more that other people share a belief that you do not, the more that it becomes an uphill battle to continue to uphold your own beliefs. Like walking upstream a river, you'll be facing resistance every step of the way because someone ""doesn't agree"" or they ""don't believe that"". Think of the bigger implications of this, not about petty shit- we're talking trying to accomplish something big in your life and many times people may be an obstacle whether it is of their intentional doing or not. We want to have enough foresight to see that shit and navigate right around it before it even becomes a problem. If you want to do something that most people never even attempt at pursuing, you're gonna face a lot of non-believers and skeptics. The truth is, if it is something you truly believe there is nothing anyone can say or do that will change that. 

&#x200B;

Ultimately, the idea is to build the strongest set of beliefs you can hold. These come from a plethora of iterations and experiences which have proven battle-hardened and are much like a code which is tested and perhaps refined each and every time. The better the code, the smoother it runs.

&#x200B;

If your set of beliefs seem to fail you at every turn then it's a perfect time to grind and sharpen those which will last you and drop the others which are of no service to you (negative self-talk, self-limiting beliefs, & so on). The better your belief system becomes the faster you grow, the more you learn, and the bigger the accomplishments you'll be able to have under your belt.",1647463047.0

**FIELD REPORT** (Cross-posted text)

I 25M feel very betrayed by my g/f 24F from the way we entered into our relationship and I feel deceived about how she has portrayed herself

I'm not the OP

&#x200B;

We met 3 years ago at a party of a mutual friend. Once we were introduced we ended up spending the entire rest of the party just sitting and talking to one another. It really felt like we were the only two people there and as the night ended she told me that she really enjoyed talking to me and asked me for my number. Which was a first for me.

&#x200B;

I awoke the next morning to a text from her telling me how much she enjoyed talking with me and wanted to know if I would be interested in getting together to talk some more. I agreed and that next weekend we met at a local book store/coffee house where we proceeded to spend 5 hours talking until the shop kicked us out because they were closing. Not once in either of the conversations did we talk about anything romantic or love or anything like that. It was everything from philosophy to economics to religion and everything in between. Once again she tells me she has had a great time and asks if we can do this again. We set a time for the next weekend and same exact thing happens again. This goes on for 3 more times and I am very confused as to what this is. Are we just friends getting together to talk? Is this going anywhere else? I had no idea.

&#x200B;

She sends me a text that week prior to meeting telling me that I am the easiest person she has ever talked to and that she feels totally comfortable and safe being with me.

&#x200B;

So finally at the end of the next day when she says she wants to do this again I just said that I was curious as to what she considered these times together as? I asked if we are just friends or was there a possibility of being more?

&#x200B;

She said that she really enjoyed our time together and would like to see where it goes. Next time we are together as we are talking I kind of reached out and took her hand and we held hands for the first time for several minutes.

&#x200B;

I tell her at the end of this night that next time I would like to do something different with her and took her to the movies. Things went well and during the movie I put my arm around her and she laid her head on my shoulder. As we parted that night I gathered up my courage and leaned in to give her a kiss goodnight. Her response was not what I expected. She actually withdrew from my attempt and I immediately apologized to her and felt like a total heel. She said that I didn't need to apologize but she was just a little shocked as she wasn't expecting it. I quickly apologized again and withdrew for the night embarrassed beyond belief.

&#x200B;

She texted me the very next day saying she was sorry about the night before, she really liked me and wants to move that direction in our relationship but she wanted to take things slow. I replied saying that I was willing to go at whatever speed she wanted and again apologized because I felt really bad.

&#x200B;

Now mind you while I said I was willing to go at her speed, and I was, but I was really confused by what ""taking it slow"" meant. We had been seeing each other once a week for hours at a time for over 2 months. But being very inexperienced in the relationship game (only had a g/f in high school and went out on dates in college but mostly as friends and nothing ever lasted) I just thought I would let her take the lead.

&#x200B;

We went out 2 more times and then at the beginning of our next date she actually greeted me with kiss. From there our relationship advanced at what I consider a normal pace. A year and a half later we were living together and IMO everything was going great. That is until two weeks ago she had to pick me up at my work because my car was in the shop. She pulled up and was sitting in the car and one of my co-workers who I'm friendly with came out with me as he was leaving at the same time. I introduced them from a distance but clearly within view of each other. They wave hello and we left.

&#x200B;

The next day I came back and he said he wanted to make sure there wasn't going to be a problem between the two of us. I asked him why would there be and he said ""she didn't say anything to you"". I said she did not and he said well it was a couple of years ago so she may not even remember him and then he proceeds to tell me that they matched up on tinder and would ""hook up"" with each other and it went on for a few months before be started dating his current girl friend. I told him that it might have been a different person and he then proceeds to show me her tinder profile. I've never used the site before so I wasn't sure how to look at anything but he said it does not look like she is active on there now and hasn't been for awhile. But the fact of the matter was that for sure it was her and to make matters worse, I didn't tell him this but the time frame that he was saying was also some of the same time we were together in the beginning. The times I was rebuked for leaning in for a kiss and quit possibly even after this.

&#x200B;

He could tell this was bothering me and he apologized but said that I needed to know that they were never ""dating"" or anything it was just getting together to have sex as though I was supposed to be okay with that. He didn't want to say much else but he said that I should know that he knows for a fact that he wasn't the only one.

&#x200B;

Needless to say this all upset me greatly but I didn't know what to do or how to handle this. It was eating away at me and I did something I probably shouldn't have done but we share an outlook calendar and have for over a year so that we can plan our events. While she was gone I looked at her laptop and found her outlook which was nothing more than what we shared. However I noticed she had a separate calendar and it was not password protected. I went back on her calendar, even though I knew it was wrong, and sure as shit there was his first name and yes for fact some of those dates were after we were already past the ""getting to know you"" stage. But wait, there's more.

&#x200B;

Not only was his name there but there were several other guys names. There were weeks where she had a different name on every day of the week and twice had two names on weekend days.

&#x200B;

What made me the sickest of all though was looking at the weeks where we were early on in our relationship when I had to basically be afraid to hold her hand that she was meeting with other guys that week and even one time earlier in the day when we met. How do I know this you might ask? My name was on there as well.

&#x200B;

Now it does appear that about 5 months after we started dating the names mostly stopped and by a year in there were no more names.

&#x200B;

But what really sucks is that one guy's name is on there more than others and this is a guy who she has brought to our house on more than one occasion and introduced us. She has never once told me that they were ever sexual partners. In fact that is what kind of pisses me off about all of this. Frankly if I didn't know any of this I would tell you she was a prude. Sex is very vanilla and I always have to initiate it.

&#x200B;

However she just told me not more than a month ago that she feels like I am her soulmate and she loves me with all of her heart.

&#x200B;

This is causing me a lot of pain to be honest. I don't think I can live with this. The fact that I had to wait for months to even kiss and hold hands while all along she was getting sex from a variety of people makes me feel like absolute shit. The fact that I honestly was beating myself up after trying for a kiss really pisses me off. Then there is a part of me that says I'm not good enough, sure she may enjoy my personality or whatever but obviously I am not attractive enough for her to want to be with me early on really bothers me.

&#x200B;

I mean it would be one thing if she did all of this before we met but there are names marked clearly after we were involved just before we moved in together. Including the guy I work with.

&#x200B;

I have yet to confront her. I don't know what I'm going to do or say. There is a very large part of me that just wants out of this. I feel like she is not the person she portrayed herself to be. Oh believe me she is a very judgmental person and has tons of opinions and comes across as holier than thou even though she is not religious per se.

&#x200B;

Has anyone else ever had to deal with this?

&#x200B;

tl:dr; g/f made me jump through hoops at the beginning of our relationship telling me we had to ""take it slow"" all the while having tinder dates with multiple guys that lasted nearly a year into our relationship and even to this day is not really sexual with me. I found all of this out from a co-worker who told me they hooked up well into out relationship although he didn't know I existed and he had proof.

After thinking about this a lot I decided that if everything was true I didn't believe I could live with it. From my point of view not only did it change the entire basically first year of our relationship it fundamentally changed who I thought she was. I mean we can all have different ways we react around people but there are some things you can't just be one way one day and one way another day.

&#x200B;

But after reading some of the replies to my first post I agreed with a couple of things. 1. Just because the names were there it doesn't necessarily mean she was sleeping with or even dating those guys. As was said my name was in there and we sure as hell weren't having sex during a lot of these times. 2. Leaving without at least giving her a chance to explain things seemed wrong as well.

&#x200B;

Which led to the dilemma I faced, how do I tell her I know about all of these names. As a reminder, I snooped. I certainly could just tell her about my co-worker but how would I know about all of the other names.

&#x200B;

So I just basically decided to tell her about the co-worker and see what happened from there.

&#x200B;

This was the most unpleasant conversation I've ever had. Because on top of everything the g/f I've had has been great, we've never fought or had even a hint of disagreement or betrayal. I love who I thought she was. So I couldn't just bail without at least talking about it.

&#x200B;

She acted like she didn't know my co-worker. She acted like she was shocked he would say this and said honestly she didn't remember him. At first I was buying everything she was selling because I wanted to and also because she was very convincing. However I showed her the tinder profile and she started to get a little defensive. She said yes, she had tinder at one time but hasn't been on it for years (which according to my co-worker was true).

&#x200B;

So I was going to drop it and just go on but at the last minute I said to her. He told me the dates you went out and how it crossed times with when you and I were together. To which she said he was lying because it ended well before we became a couple.

&#x200B;

That's when I knew she was lying. She had told me that she didn't recognize him but when confronted with timeline she now claimed to know him and said timeline was wrong.

&#x200B;

When I pointed out her logical flaw to her she became frustrated and started crying. My initial response was to comfort her but midway through doing that I decided that she might very well be doing this to manipulate me and said that while I was there for her I wanted to know the truth and this is where I sort of lied to her. I told her he provided me with in depth timeline and showed me dates on his calendar. She said she honestly did not know when, but she thought it was over before we became a couple.

&#x200B;

This is when I made my mistake of asking when did she consider us a couple.

&#x200B;

She said she considered us a couple when we moved in together. Let me remind everyone we were seeing each other for almost two years before we moved in together. So I asked her during that time frame if she had dated anyone else. She was emphatic that she didn't date anyone at all. So I know it was crude but I just came out and said ok maybe not date anyone but did you have sex with anyone. She didn't answer me and I knew my answer.

&#x200B;

By this time she is crying uncontrollably telling me how much she loved me, how everything was way in the past, etc. etc.

&#x200B;

I decided to give her a break before I confronted her because she legitimately was hyperventilating.

&#x200B;

Once she calmed down I just said I knew about the guy who she brought to our house as well. This one was obviously a subject she was dreading because she went from crying hysterically to pale as a ghost.

&#x200B;

At this point she starts trying to apologize and say's that none of the other guys have ever meant anything to her and that I am the love of her life.

&#x200B;

I told her that the only way I would even consider working through this would be for her to come clean 100% right there and then and i kind of let her know that I already know other things and would tell how I know if I have to.

&#x200B;

This was the one thing I now regret because she just flat out told me everything, things I never in a million years wanted to know. Including confirming that yes she met with tinder dates twice on days we met later in the evening. She said she did not consider us official and we hadn't even really said what we were doing was dating with those two times. Date wise she is correct from the standpoint that this was before we kissed.

&#x200B;

Anyway I told her I needed time to think about it and told her i was going to stay with a friend. She begged me not to go, she very legitimately was upset and said none of this was meant to hurt me. She didn't understand why I was so upset about the stuff from before we met but said she see's why I would be upset about things that happened after we met. I left to stay with a friend but I agreed to keep the line of communications open.

&#x200B;

She sent me a very long emotional text the next morning. Explaining how as a teenager she never respected herself and used sex to validate herself and that she had never understood what a real relationship was or what love was until she met me. It was very long and detailed but that was the gist of it.

&#x200B;

I responded that I thanked her for her honesty but I laid out how her making me wait and more to the point making me feel like a creep for just trying to reach out and kiss her while she was getting screwed by any number of guys was very hurtful to me and frankly had made me doubt myself as a man and absolutely destroyed any romantic notions I had of our relationship.

&#x200B;

She did not respond to my text so I could not decide if she was upset or mad at me. But a half hour later my friend tells me she is at the door and she is very emotional, did I want him to let her see me. I went to the door and she immediately begins crying harder than I've ever seen anyone cry. She couldn't even talk, she kept trying but it made no sense. I got her to sit down and she threw herself at me trying to hug me. After she calmed down a little she finally got out that she was so sorry, she never meant to hurt me. Eventually after quite some time she calmed down enough to talk and she let it be known that what I wrote to her was heartbreaking, she never even considered it that way. She tried to explain that she was so in love with me that she didn't want to mess it up with sex and wanted us to be what she thought we had become. I let her go on but eventually explained to her that while that may be her point of view it certainly was not mine. I just went ahead and explained that it made me feel unattractive and less desirable that guys who supposedly meant nothing to her.

&#x200B;

Well I went on for awhile myself but I'll spare you the details.

&#x200B;

I just told her that there was no way for me to go back to what we had because I do not view her as the same person anymore. That knowing that she willingly had sex with other people after she had sex with me was just a deal breaker. She jumped in and said that it never happened after we slept together, she said she would freely admit to sleeping with other guys up until we kissed but after that night she new she loved me and cut everything else out.

&#x200B;

I have no way of knowing obviously, of course I have no faith in what she said however I do have her calendar and it pretty much does show a rapid slow down right around that time.

&#x200B;

I told her I still need time and again she texted that night with a very emotional letter saying, acknowledging my feelings over this and told me that the fact she hurt me makes her feel worse than anything. That she would do anything to make this work. Swore that she has never and will never cheat on me since she fell in love with me.

&#x200B;

So I'm still here at my friends house. I still don't know for sure what I'm going to do. I do love her and I can tell she is not faking this at all, she is an emotional wreck. I've called her family to have them go check on her, just told them we were having a rough time and would prefer to not answer anything else at the time.

&#x200B;

I again want to stress this because I don't think it came across in my first post. Her personality does not show any of this at all. in fact she is quit judgmental about people who do what she did. She never said she was a virgin btw so let's not go that far. But she absolutely led me to believe she only believed in sex in the confines of a relationship. That is now a confirmed lie.

&#x200B;

I'm supposed to meet her Friday, I'm not sure if I will or won't.

&#x200B;

Sorry it's not a finalized update but I've gotten quit a few request asking what's going on

I'm sorry for making another post, I was going to tack this on my last one but for some reason my post keep getting locked and I haven't even been able to respond to people on the second one. I have been getting buried in chat request and private messages asking me for an update so instead of answer each one I am just going to post this here and hope it doesn't get deleted.

&#x200B;

Thursday later afternoon I met with a friend who knew of her but had never met her. I wanted someone with a complete fresh perspective and outside voice. In other words someone who didn't know her or had formed an opinion of her.

&#x200B;

I explained everything that I wrote in the first two posts and just asked his opinion. He said that he wasn't going to give an opinion because he and I were not alike but what he would do is ask me to consider some questions.

&#x200B;

Would I have pursued her if I knew she was actively having sex with multiple partners?

&#x200B;

Would I have willingly continued the relationship early on if I knew that she was coming on obvious dates with me but having sex with multiple partners?

&#x200B;

Knowing now what I didn't know then do I see her as the same person who I dated, fell in love with and moved in together?

&#x200B;

Did I see a future with her where I would have an unconditional trusting loving relationship with her?

&#x200B;

He had other questions as well but none were more or as important as these.

&#x200B;

I don't know why but these questions made it crystal clear what my thoughts were and what I had to do. It doesn't mean it was easy nor did I like it.

&#x200B;

On Friday I took the day off of work and two of my friends came with me and while she was at work I packed up everything that was mine from our apartment and moved it to storage. Fortunately I don't own that much and decided that anything we bought together I would leave at the apartment with her. Fortunately we are already out of our lease and were just renting month to month so there is no long term financial issue for me. But I did not want to be unfair so I went to my savings and drew out 6 months of what would have been my part of the rent.

&#x200B;

She got home from work at around 5:30 and when she came in she immediately saw my stuff was gone and she dropped her bag on the floor and sat on the couch and started crying.

&#x200B;

This was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life and I ended up crying almost as much as she did. I just explained to her that she did not deserve to be with someone who had any doubts about her or had anything but a total positive image of who she is.

&#x200B;

I told her that I had to work on myself because in talking with my friend and reading on here I found out that a lot of my ideas around sex and relationships are not in line with today's thinking and I know I have to somehow get past that.

&#x200B;

I am certain she will be far better off without me because at the end of the day I just can't be who she needs me to be. Wish I could, wish I could just view it as no big deal but I do.

&#x200B;

Anyway I stayed as long as it made sense to try and comfort her but at the end of the day I was not doing it so I left her curled up on the couch in tears.

&#x200B;

This certainly did not end how I thought or hoped it would but at the end of the day we both are very young and life is to short. She will easily find a new guy and I am going to work on myself and see if I can't grow from this.

&#x200B;

Also before I go I do want to respond to what several people had said about my co-worker who is the one who started all of this. Obviously I will never know his true motivation. He could just be a trouble maker as some have stated and I'll never know. However my belief is that he was afraid she said something and did not want there to be an issue between us at work. By both of their accounts he is the one who cut it off with her to date the girl he is with now. So while it could be jealousy or whatever I kind of doubt it. If he wanted to be with her I think he probably still could have been because he ended whatever their relationship was.

&#x200B;

Tl:dr: Friend asked me series of questions that clarified my entire thought process towards this. Ended things on Friday. Both of us are miserable but ultimately this will be better for her in the long run


**CONCLUSION**

Despite OP’s inexperience; his *process of working through* his circumstances, especially his emotions; really stands out. He didn’t attack his partner. He was critical of his own reactions. Then *proactively* sought out help. Special mention to OP’s friend. Those are the piercing questions *every man* should be asking. Casually not so much, but especially vetting for LTR’s. 

It’s always good to remind yourself. Not just that *it’s her turn;* but to remain critical of it.

My buddy got broken up with not long ago. Seemingly out of nowhere to him and it messed with him for a couple of weeks. It surprised me a little how she broke up with him, because he’s a real one and he knows his way around ladies etc. Most naturally red pilled person I know, still, as you will see in this post, he fucked up bad.

A month or so before he got broken up with, we were talking about relationships and ladies in general. I’m not so sure anymore how the convo started, but at one point I was preaching open relationships and its benefits (even though I am in a ‘closed’ LTR; I like playing the devil’s advocate). Anyway, he said that wasn’t for him, that if he was committed he was really committed and wanted a ‘ride or die’ type of thing. He also went on about how this girl was making him a better person, so I asked him why & what is his philosophy behind this attitude?

He went on to ramble about his dad (Mandatory backstory; His dad was an extremely successful athlete and developed a little gambling problem that almost cost him his career). His dad eventually met his mom who (according to my friend) helped him turn this negative cycle around and he became even more successful, also in business after his sport career. 

His argument being that the ‘right’ woman can really improve your life. At the time, I got what he said and there’s validity to it, but it still irked me the wrong way for some reason. I wasn’t sure why though and I had been drinking, so I let it slip.

Only this morning, after reading some OG posts from ECs yesterday, one from u/Heathcliff– about emotional investment especially, it finally dawned on me. 

We all know that a woman who is more emotionally invested than you will not leave you unless you tell her to. Now my buddy here, especially in hindsight, was obviously the more emotionally invested person, which became especially clear after seeing how the breakup fucked him up. The more important/interesting question is why? Of course, it had something to do with him thinking this girl was special^(TM), a mistake as old as time. 

But what is more fascinating to me, is why her being special was so significant to him and making him needy. You see, **it’s never just about the girl being special, it’s about what you believe that her being special will bring to you**. Essential distinction to make. It’s related to the story about his dad and the idea that the right woman can improve or even significantly change your life around. I realized that what irked me the wrong way about this, is that it’s a BP half-truth. On a surface level, it’s true; women can improve you and be an addition to your life. But if you take a closer look, you will always find the guy already had his shit for 98% together (no woman is turning the life of some bum around) and the woman in question just gave him the metaphorical push over the edge. The guy of course still has to put in all the work himself.

He fucked up by thinking he had found a ‘special^(TM)’ girl like his mom, who can drastically improve his life. You might realize somewhere in the back of your mind that your woman (if you got a good one) is improving you in xyz and without her, you’d be missing out. Objectively, can be true. **However, this must not become your attitude**. Your attitude must remain that you don’t need the bitch and you’ll be fine even with her gone. Which, you will be. 

Don't get me wrong, the right woman can have a very positive impact on our lives. But there is an inclination to get caught up in our feelings, view things disproportionately and assign too much significance to the (positive) impact a woman is having on our lives and before you know it, you think you are dependent on her and become needy & unattractive.

He had become dependent/fixated on the idea that finding the right(special) woman will improve him and his life and putting a burden of performance/unrealistic expectations on her and she, of course, ended up checking out.

Nietzsche thought of the feeling of being in love as inseparable from greed. 
We view others as commodities which when they tick certain boxes, we can then start this mutually beneficial transaction with them. We need to possess them and we fall in love, intoxicated by the feeling!  I want X from you, and I need to give you Y to get it. The entire SMP notion facilitates this human trading.

It’s only inevitable that any single relationship, or purchase, or trade, becomes boring after a while (desensitised of it marginal utility) and you either tolerate boredom or you try to flee by finding “true love”elsewhere. 

Looking for another high to forget about your problems and insecurities. When the positive effects of the love drug wear out, many try to convert the ones they love into slaves in an effort to ensure the prolonged protection from the wilderness, their insecurities and their weaknesses. Once you have a slave that complements you (your other half/ significant other) you don’t need to face your own weaknesses, you can safely hide.

This existential loneliness is a result of consciousness. Seeing yourself as an ego, seeing yourself as separate from everything else seeing nature as something to exploit for your own benefit. This alienation is bound to make you lonely and try to exploit others to alleviate the pain, just as one very often sees nature as something to exploit and not to live in harmony with.",1647253747.0

*“In the end, we self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages are little miracles of self-reference.” ―* Douglas Hofstadter, I Am a Strange Loop

**Life on the Edge of Entropy**

The second law of thermodynamics states, that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase. Entropy is a state of disorder or chaos.

To put this in plain English: If you wait long enough, everything eventually turns to noise.

On an infinite timeline, every atom in your body has an infinite chance to end up anywhere in the universe.

Everything eventually slides over the edge of entropy. Humans, animals, plants, objects - entire civilizations and galaxies.

Taking those horrible odds into account, it is amazing that anything exists at all.

What’s even more fascinating, is the fact that there is a clear distinction between you - who is alive - and a carcass. The latter will fall victim to entropy way faster than you.

Inside of you run billions upon billions of entropy-reduction processes, feeding on external energy and reducing the amount of chaos in your system.

Evolution has selected for every organism on this planet to enter into these types of self-replicating entropy-reduction loops.

You are the ancestor of a chemical reaction that refused to fizzle out on its own.

**As above, so below.**

The perceived equilibrium all life eventually finds with its surroundings is not static. It is a self-replicating process that repeats all day, every day.

Our bodies are self-replicating machines. Every aspect of our being is bred to enter into self-replicating loops. And our minds are no exceptions.

They are made of self-enforcing, self-replicating patterns. (Which is why we are amazing at recognizing patterns, even when there are none. Our entire reality is patterns upon patterns.)

Your mind reflexively creates self-replicating patterns to bring order to chaos, to reduce its entropy.

**Mental machinery** Have you ever wondered, how building a strong, robust body takes hard work and dedication - but how nobody ever had to *will* themselves *into* drug addiction?

Some people are simply unaffected by drugs. They take them, get high, and move on.

For *other* people, however, taking a drug for the first time turns out to be the missing part that completes a piece of mental machinery - which then will continue self-replicated for a long, long time.

The truth is this: Your mind assembles mental machinery *all the time*.

Most of the time, that machinery sputters out after a few weeks - like that one time you got really into stand-up paddling.

Other times, mental machinery gets disassembled when it no longer produces the outcomes it was originally built for - think college-socialists who move to gated communities, as soon as they cash their first fat pay-check.

But sometimes the mental machinery becomes self-replicating. It is there to stay. It becomes a part of you, your “identity”.

**The Driver‘s Seat is Vacant**

When we got to eat broccoli for the first time, we did not get to pick whether we like it or not. Our mind automatically sorted the experience for us, relative to our existing memories and mental machina. All we got was the end result of broccoli being „yucky“, and continuing to be yucky every time we had to try it.

We don‘t get to pick what mental processes persist. They randomly endure, firmly wedged into homeostasis between our inner and outer world.

Repeat this process a million times and, assuming your surroundings allow for it, you find yourself living as a pan-sexual NASCAR driver with a foot fetish.

Since any new experience is sorted by referencing what is already chugging along in our skull, even seemingly minor inputs can result in a major shift in attitude and personality down the line. And all of it is entirely chaotic.

The driver is not asleep at the wheel - he is in the back of the bus, high on Molly, getting blown by that inked-up chick that smells like cigarettes and cheap vanilla perfume.

**How to rage against the machine**

Most people’s destiny is entirely rooted in automatisms out of their control. They rage against machines external to them, unaware that their inner Machina is just as oppressive.

Assuming you are unhappy with the direction your life is taking, you likely wonder what you can do. Is it possible to actively change your mind?

Yes, you can. Theoretically, you can change your mind at will. If you had a clean slate, you could simply decide you like a certain person - or broccoli. However, this not only takes a lot of willpower - you need to learn how to get to clear your mind to get that clean slate. Otherwise, there are just loads and loads of contradictory goals rummaging around in your brain.

So let‘s park this one for a bit and start with some low-hanging fruit: Changing your external world.

As mentioned before, your mental Machina exists in homeostasis with your external world. Change the external world, some of it becomes obsolete, dysfunctional, and may even break down. This is rarely pleasant. Culture shock is a common example of this. Breakups are another.

If you want to change for the better, find out what about your surroundings feeds into the mental processes you want to rid yourself of.

Do you want to stop drinking? Stop hanging out with drinkers and going to bars. Sick of being disrespected? Ditch disrespectful people. Sick of toxic relationships? Break up.

Want to be more productive? Create a clean, functional workspace. Want to be more disciplined with the gym? Eliminate any obstacles between you and your workouts - move next to the gym, if you have to.

Initially, you will feel a sense of vertigo. You will feel home-sick and culture-shocked. You may even get worse for a little while.

This is your mind experiencing the breakdown of its components. When this happens, the mind scrambles for older creations that used to work in the past. \*Pulling up old files is easier than creating new ones. \* This is usually the point where broken-up couples get back together - they revert from their toxic personas to the sweethearts they used to be at the beginning of the relationship. Only to override it all over again.

Stay strong during the vertigo phase.

Only when referencing older mental models fails will your mind create new machinery. If your surroundings reinforce and validate these creations, they become permanent.

Trust the process, do the things you set out to do.

**How to change a mind**

If you managed to escape your toxic surroundings, you are ready for the next level: Consciously changing your mind.

Elite athletes are experts at this. They simply set a goal and decide they are capable of attaining it. There rarely is any doubt for them. They don‘t have to bullshit themselves into doing what is good for them.

To build up this mental skill, you need practice.

For a while, my favorite way to practice was sitting on the bus or the train and randomly deciding I like or dislike people.

I would look at and mentally compliment them for things that look good about them, trying to find grace in their movements and warmth in their expressions. I imagined good things happening to them and so on. A positive side-effect of this: The conscious effort mutes your inner-chatter, blocking out any self-doubts about what the other person might think about you. This skill turned out to be profoundly useful at work because it allowed me to instantly connect with people.

Sometimes I practiced the opposite: Deciding I dislike people - and then seeing if I can revert that dislike at will.

If you want to take this a notch further, you can even decide you love/hate doorknobs, furniture or certain foods.

However, being able to hate kitchen-counters at will is not really a useful skill. But deciding you are going to like your workout is.

People normally make the mistake of imagining how much they are going to like having a fit body or being admired for their skills. This is a mistake and a coping mechanism.

I at some point decided I am going to like the actual work-out-sessions. I decided exerting my body was a pleasant sensation.

At first, this is not going to work. You need some practice. But there is a very distinct sensation when this process starts working:

The colors in the room will become brighter and you will have more peripheral vision. This is because of your pupils widening in anticipation of pleasure.

If the new preferences you decided upon are in agreement with your internal and external world, they will stick and permanently replicate themselves.

But be careful, this may also work against you.

**Getting a clean slate**

Some people are going to have a harder time with implementing new mental routines than others. Those people are usually filled up with self-replicating, dysfunctional mental processes.

Writing new information is a lot harder for them.

The solution here is investing time into uprooting those processes, i.e. mindfulness meditation. Catching yourself in the act a few times (and maybe changing your external world in response) is usually enough to kill off a dysfunctional process, or at least mute it for a while.

If you can master this - changing your surroundings for the better, actively deciding on your emotional state, and killing off dysfunctional mental machinery with mindfulness - then your *entire life* will become a piece of pleasant, self-replicating machinery.",1647263533.0

*“Taste is first and foremost distaste, disgust and visceral intolerance of the taste of others.”* ― Pierre Bourdieu, Distinction

**Story-time: Habitual Assholes**

Back when I was still in the “piss-poor” stage of my life, I was making a living as a musician.

A lot of my gigs consisted of playing at rich people’s weddings. Usually, those people were of the “affluent” variety. They were pretty well off - think dentist-dynasties with rows of German super-cars parked in front of the venue.

However, they did not have the kind of money that multiplies all by itself. If they stopped working for a few years, all their wealth would disappear within less than a generation. They would not be able to maintain their lifestyle.

Hence, the need to constantly work reminded them of their place in life - which then created in them the need to remind *other people* of theirs.

This need manifested itself in two ways: Being shitty to other people, and showing off. Sometimes both at once.

One such part of showing off was having a band at your wedding. Not because you prefer live music over Spotify playlists - but because you simply *had to* have a band at weddings.

This usually meant I played a lot less time than I was booked for, leaving me free to people-watch and socialize.

Now there I was, eating copious amounts of free wedding cake that skinny trophy-wives were too afraid to touch. Observing tipsy semi-rich people being shitty and toxic to each other and the staff of the venue - but no one was ever shitty to me at those events. Not once.

This did not at all fit my usual experience in life, where I was usually shat on by whoever was higher on the hierarchy.

They were awful even to my band-mates - but not to me, the singer.

It took meeting a multi-millionaire, an *actual* rich person, to figure it out. Turns out, this guy had some of the most amazing people-reading skills I ever witnessed.

(Which, now that I think about it, was probably quite important in his position.)

“You aren’t one of them. But you are not one of the *others* either”, he said.

“You display nothing they can look down upon. You are not triggering their reflexes.”

I was wearing suit pants, a white shirt and suspenders - not cheap, ill-fitting suits like my band. Nothing about me was tipping them off.

""And what makes you awesome can not be bought with money."", he said - referring to my voice, my fit body, and my youthful looks.

“People are assholes out of habit, but it is not their default mode. If you don’t trigger that habit, they are usually perfectly polite.”

And then he added another nugget of wisdom:

“If you want to move up in the world, learn to move around them.”

**Like vapor condensing off the Lid**

In recent years I have resorted to labeling the aforementioned type of people “Lids”.

Because, much like the lid on a pot, they trap any rising steam - only to have it condense and run back down.

The “Caste of the Lid“ consists of any person who has a fleeting amount of power that needs to be constantly re-asserted. They may be of the affluent variety, but not necessarily. They can be people in upper management - or people in middle-management fraternizing with the higher-ups. Even people at low-level government offices can be Lids given the right set of circumstances.

A Lid is anyone whose power to say “no” may adversely affect your progress in life and who is incentivized to say “no” because it solidifies their position in the social hierarchy - or because it is just plain fun to them.

Examples: If you don’t dance to the tune of upper (and by proxy middle-)management - no promotion for you.

If you don’t have the right papers ready at the government’s office - come back in 2 weeks, when they are open again.

If nobody buys from your business, it may be dead in the ditch. If someone complains about your work as a waiter…

...you get the idea.

**Social Stealth: Walk softly, and carry a big dick**

If you are like me, and you come from a working-class background, you have three main social modes: Servant-mode, which you display at work and when talking to higher-ups, rough-talking buddy-mode for when you hang out with your peers, and asshole-mode for any time you need to establish dominance. None of this is going to cut it with the Lids.

Now, if you are *a lot* like me, and you also have a raging hate-boner for bullies - please, do yourself a favor and don’t go all Tyler Durden on them.

**Instead of picking fights - try being social-stealthy.**

Lids are naturally inclined to defend the status quo. Upward social mobility, along with declining property values, has caused them shivers of rightful wrath.

It is best not to trigger that reflex, not to tick off their disgust, and not sound their alarms.

Ditch what looks poor and unattractive about yourself, stop behaving like a service worker, and build up attractive qualities that can not be bought with money - i.e. display status with a good physique, charisma, social skills, and *quiet big dick energy*.

You may piss in a few soups, yes, but ultimately, you can not win this fight by being more alpha and flaunting your alpha-ness.  
Because *nothing* satisfies a Lid more than putting someone in their place, who, without the constraints of the societal strata, would be shoving a broom up their ass and ditch them in a field as a scare-crow.

The sad truth is this: If you want to move up in the world, you will have to deal and make deals with those people. And if you are unable to properly handle them, you are going to waste a lot time, money, dignity, and emotional energy.

Be social-stealthy, position yourself and pick your battles.

Remember: **You can not sell to the poor.**

And as long as you don‘t have access to the super-rich, you need to reliably extract money from the Lids without losing your sanity/dignity in the process. You need the Lids.

There are several ways to go about this - among them scamming, opening Starbucks next to a yoga studio, or starting a cult, but neither of those is my area of expertise.

Having a degree in a STEM field or a sought-after profession may instantly flip the power dynamic - but it is subject to the ebb and flow of the market. If a small number of professionals is cornering the market for a particular type of work, you can bet that they won‘t be holding all those chips for long.

**On that note: Working your way up does not work in 2022.**

Eating shit and working hard won‘t get you past the Lids. 

**It will make you a better, more hard-working, more efficient shit-eater.**

The Lids prefer to staff high paying jobs with one of their own. Again: They may vote for policies that enhance social upward mobility, but they don’t want it in *their* sphere of influence.

**How I worked my way up:**

My solution was working in sales. I work as a broker / high ticket closer.

Why? Because that way you meet a lot of people and there are always people buying and people selling. Your network keeps constantly expanding. Any prospect you brokered to may become a client in the future. You always have an abundance of people to talk to, never getting held back by any one single individual.

Also, you don‘t have to deal with any of the fulfillment, which is usually where people become shitty.

In that way, working in sales is a lot like show-business:

Get in, play the show, cue the fireworks, get out. 

&#x200B;

**The 7-hour rule**

Ironically, selling expensive goods and services is way easier than selling medium-priced or low-priced.

Why?

Because, as big buying decisions take longer, people will be inclined to spend more time with you to arrive at a said decision. And the more time they spend with you, the more they will begin to like you - if you can avoid giving them any reason not to, like triggering their disgust. We like what is familiar to us and we dislike the *other*.

People need about 7 hours with you to build trust. You can off-set this to a surrogate (like marketing material) to a certain degree - but the best way to build trust is to spend time together.

**Selling a 5.000$ dollar product takes almost as much energy as selling a 30.000$** \- but you have a much larger time frame to do the latter.

The high-end salespeople - that I know - are not much smoother than me. Yeah, they are all fucking smooth - but they mostly have access to higher-value products/services and higher-value clients. And they can be consistent over large time-frames, taking their clients to business lunches and hang-outs, inching their way to the deal.

The key to selling to Lids, or even working with them in any capacity, is rapidly disqualifying them. They are not rare, there is a lot of them. Ultimately, they are almost as exchangeable as the working class. You can burn through a lot of them before it catches up with you, especially in big markets and cities.

Cut off any bored window-shoppers who waste your time and any puppeteers commandeering you around.

Once you start doing that, you will be left with those who have a genuine problem that you can solve. (Like selling to/for them.) And some are even quite nice.

If you have managed to not trip off their sense of disgust, accepting your help will not feel like loss, defeat, or sub-ordination to them.

On that note: This is the reason customers are instinctively shitty to people in the service industry. They feel like they are at the mercy of people who disgust them: Without their waiters, they go hungry, without mechanics their car won‘t run - and they feel the instinctual need to be an asshole to re-establish the pecking order.

And that assholery almost always goes unchecked and unpunished. The customer is king. He may be an inbred, retarded and cruel psychopath - but who else is going to pay 7 dollars for a coffee?

**Things you can do right now to move up in the world**

1. Identify anyone in your life who fits the description of a lid: He has power over you, solidifies his position by saying no / being mean to you, can block access to opportunity.
2. Put all those people on a list ~~and murder them~~ and identify ways to circumvent those people in the future.

If your Lid is a middle-manager, find work-related ways to get in contact with higher-ups. Pitching a pet project, taking on key roles or siloing information are great ways to do so. Also, again, try to avoid setting off their disgust-reflex.

If you own a business and a lot of your customers/clients are Lids, find a way to screen for that during the first 30 minutes of talking to them. If you find they are Lids, charge them extra to either disqualify them or at least have some extra cash as reparations.

Eventually, you will notice how you are rarely around unpleasant people anymore, how you can have all your conversations in plain, honest English - and how all your discussions are about *how* to solve a problem and not *why* it is impossible.

Then you will have snuck past the Lids for good.

You have become social-stealthy.",1646873501.0
160,Society Has Programmed You To Be A Beta Buxx From A Young Age.,407,t7f7uv,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/t7f7uv/society_has_programmed_you_to_be_a_beta_buxx_from/,67,"As far back as I can remember, my mother always used to tell me, ""Son, become a doctor and you will get a good wife and have status."" That's all she used to tell me. Did she care about what I wanted? Nope. Indirectly she was telling me, ""Live for the people, so they can be impressed by your status and then find a gold digger who will only be impressed by my profession."" Yes. That's what she was telling me. 


And before TRP my thinking and mindset was only money, money and money. That I need a couple million before marriage for a so called ""good"" wife. And you know what? I was dumb. I never once thought that, she will only be with me for my profession and income. And, whatever I did prior discovering TRP in life, was for this imaginary ""unicorn"" that I was not even guaranteed with. As the other post said, the final phase of red pill is, You get to chill and don't give a fuck for good. And that's what we should all strive for. Society wants you to be a beta buxx. 


Society wants you to believe in the idea of marrying a former hoe, and turning her into a housewife and in the process becoming miserable. Marriage in the modern age can never work. It's an failed institution and the statistics don't lie. All these Trad cu-cks wouldn't tell you the misery they are in, you know why? Because once you're married legally, you're stuck as a man. She can deny and manipulate you with sèx, be disobedient towards you, and still take half of your shi and get away with everything. The state/laws give them the power to. That's how easy it is for women to play men in today's times.



 In the modern age, majority of women are emotionally broken/damaged, **and by you being the ""good"" husband to come and save the day, who doesn't understand female nature and how they work, and who was always told be ""nice"" to women will only get manipulated and be miserable**. She knows whatever you're doing, (all those roses/dinners and fake compliments) is to get access to what's between her legs, and she'll use that great power she has over you, and manipulate you in getting whatever she wants.



 **One must understand the greatest power any women has over you, is not her physical strength, neither her intellect, neither her character. It's just what's between her legs**. For example, imagine an 18 year old women who gets all the attention in the world. Random men become ""nice"" to her when they see her, and she has a huge # of guys just pleading to get with her, and doing whatever it takes to get one second of her time. Society makes everything ""easy"" for her and that's why as they say, women live life on ""easy mode"" in their younger years because society enables them to. When all this takes place, it doesn't take long for women to realize the great power of what they have between their legs. So then they use their weapon (their pussy) in getting what they want from men, and especially her husband by manipulating him with sèx. [Women in the modern age only marry beta providers. ](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/dating/marriage-rates-decline-reason-economically-attractive-men-jobs-income-a9098956.html?amp) 



**Women will only genuinely respect a guy from the heart which they cannot manipulate, and will marry a guy which they can manipulate.** The guy who doesn't get manipulated (who she really wants) has many options, and she knows that he will never be exclusive to her.



 **You see when a guy has options, he doesn't need to rely on one women for sèx. If one gives him a hard time, what does he do? He simply walks away, and goes to the others**. Women instinctively know, a guy with options can never be manipulated and their classic ""coochie game"" will never work on these guys. So, what do they do? They marry a guy who isn't that much sèxually wanted, (boring, safe option) which Society wants you to be, but still has sufficient resources to protect her and will stay loyal. And in return, she'll give him the occasional birthday BJ special, or she'll lay there as a dead fish just ""waiting"" for him to be done quick. **Why? Because this was the guy she married, who she wasn't sèxually attracted to. She will manipulate him with sèx and use it as a weapon, because she knows he doesn't have any options and will do everything for her, in ""hopes"" of bànging her.**


 **Most of us on this sub, are not the Tyrone to just ""pump and dump"" women. It's not in our nature, and it's not in us. Also, we aren't simp's to worship women. We are somewhere in the middle, who understand women very well and we value our self respects the most, so we can never be the beta buxx which society wants us to be.** So, when we see the rigged game what we do? We do our own thing. For some guys it's being on their purpose, and improving their lives for the better. For some it may picking up new hobbies and whatever etc. And, when you choose a simplistic lifestyle, no matter how much you have, happiness and inner peace is found in small things. We men need very little to find that ""inner peace."" But that doesn't mean you stop self improving. The day you stop self improving, is the day you die. 


In conclusion gentlemen, whatever society promised you is all a fantasy tale of the ""unicorn"" waiting out there somewhere. In the end, their is no unicorn waiting at the finish line, and if you marry, you're just another beta buxx nice guy who is saving a women, who has ridden all the Tyrones and gave them all the free sex, while you're just her long term ""safe"" option. And in the end, as we all know it's AWALT. Never forget this.",1646503801.0
161,InternetVersion - or Why Introversion Isn't an Excuse,55,t7hcsm,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/t7hcsm/internetversion_or_why_introversion_isnt_an_excuse/,17,"> Introversion: attitude-type characterized by orientation in life through subjective psychic contents.

> Extraversion (or extroversion): attitude-type characterized by concentration of interest on the external object.


[Carl Jung’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) original definitions are above. 

At some point, socially, these become the binary personality trait(s) in which people began to identify themselves. The test could be reduced to a simple, nonchalant question: ""on a Friday night, would you rather be out partying, or stay home reading a book? The core of the matter is: do you want to be alone or with people?""

Introversion is one of the oldest memetic identities appealing to the “special individual”, long before MBTI was popular on Internet. Because introversion wasn’t nuanced or special enough, the “best of both worlds” aka ambiverts emerged. I have also come across terms like Omniverts, introverted extroverts, and extroverted introverts - whatever that means.

It is manifestly obvious that individuals on one extreme of the spectrum or the other are, in fact, rare. The going out every weekend with 47 Instagram stories is about as infrequent as the basement hermit *in the long term* (they both still exist). Jung thought anyone who was purely one or the other should be classed as insane.

Jung believed everyone possessed the characteristics of each binary, with one being **more dominant than the other**. A single continuum or scale represented his interpretation. Ambiversion is when one falls more or less directly in the middle. The rationality behind this spectrum is understandable: if you are not with people, you are alone, and vice versa. It is binary, exclusive logic; you are either doing one or the other, you cannot be both or neither.

If you ask the Internet or a pop-psych magazine, it will tell you extroverts are those who “recharge their batteries” by being in social situations. Introverts do so by being alone, due to each becoming ""drained"" from the opposite situation. 

The Internet is “socialized” by an introverted majority. With a few social media exceptions, most chatrooms, forums, and websites are frequented by people with a proclivity to avoid IRL socializing. However, during their so-called “alone time”, (a majority of the time for an introvert) they are fixated on a screen. But...what are the so called ""terminally online"" often doing in those screen-time moments? 

**Using the internet to interact with others.**

If ambiverts are “the best of both worlds,” then Internetverts are the worst of both experiences. Neither really alone nor truly interacting with others, they live a life of artificial connection and imagined solitude. They possess neither an a deep connection to their inner world, nor do they bond with other people in a fully human way (the primary functions associated with intro/extroverts, respectively).

Internetverts often call themselves introverts because surfing the Web is a solitary activity, and they need to feel special. However, if one has a twitter account and relentlessly stalks comment sections, is that really solitary? Their desire for socialization is there, they have simply resigned themselves to cheap, safe alternatives. The online persona is easily moldable and unbodied; it can be whatever it pretends or LARPs to be. This process becomes the perfect form of escapism, satisfying the urge to socialize without needing to address the unconscious mind, or deal with the confrontation a real life discussion entails.

Thus, the previous quantitative means of measuring introversion and extroversion might not be practical anymore. Instead, a more insightful metric is the quality of the time we enjoy both alone and accompanied. If Jung were to comment, I believe he would say we are using these tools to ""avoid facing [our Shadow](https://artsofthought.com/2020/11/17/carl-jung-and-the-shadow-a-guide-to-the-dark-side-of-the-mind/)"". To simplify and explain, the Jungian Shadow, ""is a symbol that represents the hidden side of every human psyche. The Shadow is composed of hidden aspects of an individual’s personality that are deemed as “unacceptable,” and tucked away into the hidden parts of their mind.""

Most of what is hateable about society is actually the screaming Shadows of extra-special internetverts. Why does an [AWFL](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=AWFL) (fucking phenomenal acroynm) play White Savior in a ridiculous way? Could it be that their Shadow made them cross the street a few too many times when a [gang of ""yutes""](https://youtu.be/K6qGwmXZtsE?t=91) was on the same sidewalk? Could the experience of legitimate racism by a person of color cause them to later imagine it everywhere, like a boogeyman?

Even legitimate introverts will experience the human urge to be gregarious...but it is much easier to redirect that urge online. This subpar substitution, by nature and design, will make one crave it constantly to compensate. This system is also abused by extroverts. After the party, they will immediately go into more extroverted social media like Snapchat - extending the socialization by any means necessary and avoid truly being alone with their thoughts and feelings. However, these types don't tend to decide ""politics with strangers"" is the game they want to incessantly play. That is why I picked on intro/internetverts with this post, as the correlation is much stronger between internetverts and introverts than extroverts.

Internetverts dominate much of online conversation. Once this fact is cemented in your mind, the desire to consume rage porn goes away in favor of communication with non-internetverts. The escape from binary thinking and binary identification (whether intro/extroverted) is a key solution to the problem of internetversion. If you perceive the identity as complex, then overt simplification of women are X and Masculinity is Y goes away.

Repeating catchphrases like touch grass is fun and all, but the real change comes from developing stability around the self - away from labels. A strong self can communicate with other strong selves. That interaction is a wonderful thing, and I hope this encourages at least one person to do it.",1646509954.0
162,Reminder- Never make her your focus,420,t4rrce,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/t4rrce/reminder_never_make_her_your_focus/,121,"From another subreddit-

*Today my wife told me she wants to bang other dudes while I'm at work

Throwaway because I'm embarrassed.
For starters, I (29m) am deeply love my wife(27f) and she loves me more than anybody ever has before. Until today I have considered myself very lucky to fall in love with her, and felt like it was my biggest accomplishment in life, and have done everything I can for her. We never planned on getting married, but when she aged out of her parents' insurance, she was freaking out about not having healthcare. I didn't even hesitate and offered to marry her so she could get on my insurance. This made my weekly rate go up by five times compared to what I would pay for just myself. That hurt, but my priority number one had been her. She had a late start on college, and she's only a handful of classes in. She's been taking just one or two classes a semester and wants to get a 7 year degree (that would take 14-28 years at the rate she is going). I thought about it and decided it would be better for her to take three or four classes a semester, and I would pay for the classes myself. But in order to afford that, I had to take a an overnight lead position at work, and get as much overtime as I possibly could. So I've been working my ass off. I'm making more money, but I can't even spend any of it on myself. Since my wife is so preoccupied with school, she could only work 20-25 hrs a week at a lowly paying restaurant job. Because of this, she can barely make rent and her own bills. So I've been footing the grocery and medical bills, and saving every dollar I can for her schooling. I don't even eat out any more. It hurts to see so much of my money go, but it was always worth it feeling like I was supporting my wife. This has come at a cost of us not seeing each other most nights, but we agreed it was a sacrifice we had to make to have a better future together. It has been rough, but we have been making the most of every single minute we have after she gets off work, and before I leave. Every experience we've had together feels like a cute little date. We try to have sex every day, minus the one she has to work a double on. Some times even twice a day. Not a crazy amount of sex, but I think a solid amount. Regardless, she feels very lonely at night.
Anyway, today we have a conversation that goes something like this; Her: I love you so much, I wouldn't even mind if you hooked up with other women, so long as you let me know Me: Hmmm you've told me this before, why do you say that? Her: I just think our love is so strong, it wouldn't even be phased by that. And if it's something you want to do, I wouldn't be upset. Me: That's really nice! But I would rather share you in a threesome!
We both talked about the possibility of a threesome before, and both agreed if one of us wanted have one, the other would agree to do it. Though I think the idea of a threesome is hot, I never asked for one, because she is great, sex with her is great, I don't feel like our love life really needs that kind of spice. And to be honest, I think I would get jealous.
She goes on to say: That would be fun! But it doesn't have to be a threesome, you can honestly hook up with other girls on your own and that would be fine.
Then it starts to dawn on me...
Me: Wait a minute, are you trying to get my permission to hook up with other guys? Her: Well I've been so lonely and horny lately, I think it would really help me while you're away.
I was heartbroken to hear this. The only reason I'm away at night is so I could financially support her and her costly dreams. I started tearing up, and felt so hurt.
Me: So I put everything I have into working and saving for you, working nights, which I hate to do, and you want to punish me for that... by cucking me??? Her: No! No! I'm sorry for saying any of that. That was very selfish of me. Me: Don't be sorry, you're only being honest.
At this point, tears are rolling down my cheeks, and I feel so small; not like much of a man at all. I'm not mad at her, as a matter of fact, I respect her for being so bravely honest, but it hurts to know she wants to be with other guys, when all I want to do is be with her. She started to feel guilty, and began to apologize like crazy, even saying she fucked up by even bringing it up. I can't even look at her, because I know that would make me break down and sob uncontrollably. When I'm sad or mad, I get very passive aggressive, and as she kept trying to apologize, asking what she could do to make it right, I just kept giving her short answers. ""You did nothing wrong"" ""it's my fault for not being enough."" Eventually I excused myself to the bathroom, and cried there until it was time for me to go to work. I avoided her on the way out, and had the most depressing drive to work.
It's been eating away at me the whole shift. I've been living for her. I slave away at work as much as they will let me for her. I spend every minute outside of sleeping and working with her. I buy everything she can't for her. I express my love for her every chance I get. I thought I was being a good husband, and today, I felt like what I'm doing for her ain't shit. I am so devastated that the solution she came up with for her loneliness, is to be dicked by another guy while I'm out earning money for her dreams. Again, I'm not mad at her, but now I know she doesn't see me the same way that I see her. I get lonely being away from her too, but I would never want to cure that by being balls deep in another woman. My reality is shattered, I feel so inadequate, and like I will never be enough for her. She has apologized and wants to make things right, but I don't know if they could ever be right again. Even if we get through this, I'm always going to be wondering if she's hooking up with other guys and just not telling me about it, since the one time she even brought up the idea, I took it like a crybaby bitch. I'm not looking for any advice on the matter, I just really needed to get this off my chest somehow, but I am far too embarrassed to bring it up to anyone I know.
TLDR; I've been working nights to save more money for my wife's schooling. She got lonely, and now wants to bang other dudes while I'm gone. Now I'm sad, sad, sadder than sad.*

My heart goes out to this dude.
Never commit fully, boys. Bitches come and go. Enjoy the grind and know women for what they really are.",1646195635.0
163,"What Do You Want, vs What Do You Think You Deserve?",50,t4mh88,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/t4mh88/what_do_you_want_vs_what_do_you_think_you_deserve/,10,"Here’s an exercise I want you to do right now. Ask yourself this question:

**What do I** ***want***?

Come up with all the goals you want to work on, all the things you want to achieve, the person you want to become. Tell me the things you’d give anything to have, even if you think they’re years away (or maybe altogether impossible).

Then I want you to ask yourself this question:

**What do I think I** ***deserve***?

Often you’ll find there’s a huge discrepancy between what you want, and what you think you actually deserve. Sometimes there’s a disconnect.

Maybe you feel like the things you want are way too far off; like you’re at the bottom of the mountain, unsure how the hell you’ll ever get to the top. Well, the answer to that is simple – one step at a time. That old cliché holds true; the journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step. Stop looking so far ahead, stop obsessing about how far you still have to go, and just do what’s right in front of you: take it one single day at a time.

Other times you feel like you simply aren’t good enough to have the things you want; like your goals are things only “cool” people get to have, or guys who are “good enough” or “worthy”. Sometimes you even feel completely [hopeless](https://killyourinnerloser.com/hopeless-and-helpless/), convinced there’s no possible way you’ll ever make it.

It doesn’t really matter why there’s a disconnect; all that matters is you recognise it and be aware of the fact you feel like you don’t deserve your goals. Because otherwise you’ll likely end up self-sabotaging, not going all-in, being too afraid of failure and not doing whatever it takes to win.

And believe me, I’ve been there myself. I spent the longest time self-sabotaging, not doing whatever it took to succeed, because I was convinced I didn’t “deserve” to get laid. I ended up taking 5 months off from self-improvement/getting laid and just sat around depressed and miserable, making the excuse of “I have to fix a health issue” that really wasn’t that big a deal. I did that because I was scared, I was terrified that I didn’t deserve to reach my goals.

I did the same thing with my business, spending the first 2 years making practically no money and having to work a full-time job at the same time, all because I was convinced I didn’t ever “deserve” to be at it full-time.

That disconnect between “what I want” and “what I deserve” isn’t something you need to beat yourself up over. Often the cure is to just be aware of it, do everything you can to make sure you don’t self-sabotage, and then push forward towards your goals in spite of the disconnect. Almost everything I ever achieved was in spite of the fact I really didn’t think I deserved it. In fact, I’m pretty much always full of doubt, but I still manage to achieve my goals. Just because you don’t believe you deserve your goals, doesn’t mean you’re correct.

So go back and ask yourself those two questions. *“What do I want? What do I think I deserve?”* If there’s a disconnect, admit it and start being aware of it. Beat it by sharing it here. Often just the fact you’re aware of the disconnect is enough to stop you self-sabotaging.

I’ll leave you with something tangentially-related I saw in a thread the other day: *“When you get to the finish line you won’t give a shit how long it took you. You’ll just be happy to be there.”*",1646179799.0

This article got me thinking: it is quite natural for guys to want to work harder when they are trying to impress the ladies (conspicuous consumption; how effective that is in getting long-term sustainable attention from the opposite sex is another matter) or if they have a family and want to support it. The above tends to be the Blue Pill worldview but it is still followed by many guys, hence the relevancy.

But what if guys realize that the realistic possibility of attracting a decent long-term mate is just not there - either the guy is not attractive enough and becomes an incel, or the guy does not find a woman worthy of long-term commitment and goes MGTOW - how does that affect that individuals desire to work hard and produce until he is 67? 

Logically speaking, if you realize that you will have no dependents on you, and you are currently earning enough to sustain yourself, your hobbies and to save up for a pension a little bit - why not retire a few decades earlier, then? Due to the singledom status and giving up on women/not having children, the material need is much lower than otherwise, so the need to work until you're practically dead is just not there. Why not just kick back and relax? 

Have you noticed single unmarried guys with no kids that have never been divorced doing that? How realistic is it, in your opinion? Maybe you are living such life?",1646142798.0
165,The character-personality duality and how we hold ourselves back from spinning (better) plates,168,t2y6y1,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/t2y6y1/the_characterpersonality_duality_and_how_we_hold/,16,"***Disclaimer***: *this post assumes you have a basic level of financial independence, a sense of fashion and you look after your body (grooming and lifting).*

&#x200B;

**Summary**

Personality and character, the most underestimated aspects of our SMV. A rich personality means we can express ourselves along the entire spectrum of energy, emotion, dominance etc. It manifests itself entirely on a primal level and it is where human connection happens. Our character determines how free we are to act independent of where we are on a primal level. There are massive differences (originating from the brain structure) between personality and character, yet their relationship is vital to build our mind, a mental hygiene and eventually a richer life.

&#x200B;

**Body**

**Introduction**

Our SMV is pretty much entirely determined by our genetics (looks, height, d\*ck size), our earned attributes (muscles, money, status) and our learned attributes (personality, character, social intelligence). Incels tend to primarily focus on their genetic misfortune, mainstream boys religiously attempt to earn their way into the pussy, quickly turning into assholes crusading against all those who skip the line through developing an actual personality. Provider game has its place, but it’s overrated when spinning plates is what you’re after. Time and time again I see jacked guys in the club, high on their inflated self image but always *trying* to look cool, luring eyes around the room and plastic smiles waiting for the alcohol to give them a personality. Put in another way: looks, money, status are mostly just an opener, but nothing more. If we can’t hold a simple conversation, if we can’t be playful, sexual, if our energy is always low, stuck in a negative mind, only focused on getting laid, then our personality is entirely underdeveloped, plain and boring. Whatever plates we’ll be able to spin, it’s doubtful there will be any of actual quality.

&#x200B;

**A rich personality**

The first thing or two everyone notices about strangers in the street, in the gym or in the store is their awkwardness, their shifting avoiding eyes, their bent over posture, their plastic smile, their insecure voice, their trying to be cool and tough and indifferent, their imagined self-importance… In other words, their personality. We communicate with everyone around us continuously, we are able to like or dislike people from miles away. Everything we do - every gesture, every flex, every step, every look - our personality oozes out of every muscle we squeeze.

Our *personality* is entirely determined by our primal brain and limbic system. The most important dimensions of our personality when it comes to spinning plates are:

* Energy (low, high)
* Emotion (negative, positive)
* Dominance (following, leading)
* Empathy (compassion, antipathy, apathy)
* Focus (process-oriented, goal-oriented)

The size, depth and complexity of our personality then is the **range** of these dimensions we span. For example, our ability to tell a story with low *and* high energy, our ability to feel what someone else feels (compassion), emotionally disagree with it (antipathy) or to be indifferent towards it (apathy). Our capacity for sexual energy (without feeling emotionally embarrassed). Our ability to play our part in the male-female dominance polarity. Our ability to focus and enjoy the moment while at the same time leading her towards our bedroom. A rich personality means to possess the ability to move along the entire spectrum of every dimension instead of being stuck at any one side.

Important:

1. Human connection and attraction manifests itself only on a personality level.
2. This entire system of our brain has been around far longer than the development of logic, reason, and language (neocortex). The latter has therefore little to no part in the mating game. Of course the source of much beta confusion over “what to say to a girl” and why being smart won’t get you laid.

&#x200B;

**A strong character**

It’s safe to say “friendship circle game” is the most human adapt way of meeting sexual partners. For billions of years, our male and female ancestors ate, slept and traveled together for long periods of time, providing ample room to meet and select lovers or providers. That room of weeks to get acquainted with a stranger is in our world reduced to mere minutes. It is so obscure that more than 99% of men today living in metropolitan areas simply have no clue how to meet strangers other than through work or already established friends. It is only a meager few who have taken their fate into their own hands, and understood that their primal instincts can be retrained. With the logical knowledge that there simply is no scarcity of women around them, and a character to navigate through the short term discomfort, they leverage the well-established route of experience to reshape the primitive personality they’ve been given.

Our character is determined by the neocortex. We know what is good for us in the long run. We know instantly which choice is born from weakness, and which one from strength. Where our emotions can flip with a cup of coffee or the acknowledgment of a girl, our compass of strength points in the same direction until we die.

The *strength of our character* then - our ability to follow our character - is determined by how free we are to act independent of where we are on an emotional, energetic, empathic… level (where we are in our personality space). In other words, how much we can trust ourselves to actually do something (hit the gym, approach a girl) regardless of how we feel, our current focus, etc.

*A strong character is what gives us* ***control*** *over our personality, and can ultimately* ***shape*** *it.*

For example: do I always drift towards negative (antipathy) thoughts about others? Am I unable to become playful (process-focused, positive light emotions) after an exhausting day in the office? Do I just hope or wait to feel good, to feel motivated? These are classic symptoms of a weak character, of being unable to follow our inner compass of strength in those moments that it is needed the most.

**Self-pity** is experienced when we strongly want to do something but seem unable to commit ourselves to do it. We feel helpless, stuck. Character is therefore the opposite of self-pity. The latter often goes together with either a narrow one sided undeveloped personality, or an extremely unstable one.

Again, attraction is not manifested on this level. To have the character to run a marathon is not going to get you laid. The personality (and physique) you build with that character will. Also, extremely unstable (but rich) personalities are unfortunately often very attractive both to males and females, and it is only on a logical level that people warn “not to get involved”.

&#x200B;

**The dichotomy**

Often our personality and character are not aligned, which creates a dichotomy. We struggle with ourselves, we experience conflicting impulses and desires. We want to talk to a girl, but fear ridicule or rejection. We know lifting those weights will make us better, but we have to drag ourselves out of that couch to get ready and drive to the gym anyway. This dichotomy can range from a simple inconvenience to completely paralyzing us, but its nature is always the same.

The *relationship* between our character and personality, the relationship we have with ourselves, is key in developing both a rich personality and a strong character. If I have a dominant negative mind, chances are I’m unable to allow myself to fail, to look stupid, to be awkward. If somehow I did manage to try something new, I would beat myself up over it and quit the moment things go sideways. But to internalize something, in other words, to ingrain something you read or know rationally into your personality, requires a robotic awkward phase. You may remember the first time you did a barbell bench press or squat. It takes time and exposure to build all the small stabilizer muscles and muscle memory. Developing a healthy relationship with ourselves means being the first to laugh (not mock), to be able to put ourselves into perspective, and eventually motivate ourselves even more through failure.

&#x200B;

**Examples on the influence of (and lack of) personality and character on your game**

* You talk to a girl, solely goal-focused on getting laid. You are unable to be genuinely playful, enjoy the process and the emotional connection. You come across as too pushy, too needy.
* You are stuck in a high energy, positive emotion personality. Your voice is always too high, you’re talking too much. You think everything has to be funny. When she says something semi-serious, you laugh, she laughs awkwardly. No emotional connection. No meaningful rapport. She leaves.
* Personality entirely relying on leading. Risky thing to say in this sub but this is a strong character who forces his personality to be one dimensional. We’ve all sat at a table with that one guy who couldn’t give the word to someone else, always wants to be number one, always wants to call the shots, or is too aggressively playful (military style). Mostly girls just vanish. Being a leader of men also means knowing when to take a step back and redistribute attention.
* You try to talk to a girl in the street or in a club, she brushes past you, giving you a demeaning or creeped-out look. You’re sad (compassioned with her) or become resentful (antipathy response). You feel like shit, low energy, and you’re unable to be apathetic towards others when it matters. You go home and masturbate (zero character or ability to bounce back to another mind set).
* You can pretty much freely express your personality verbally and non-verbally along many dimensions. Many girls come and go. Your personality does not transform based on what she is looking for (healthy male-female polarity). You can open up about some shit going on in your life without becoming a needy fuck. You playfully build and break rapport. You’re in control of the sexual tension and don’t release it awkwardly by entertaining her. You can escalate physically because that’s what feels right in the moment. You have a personality that isn’t afraid to show itself and doesn’t mirror the one it’s looking at. Congratulations, you’re spinning a plate you actually want to spin.

&#x200B;

**How to develop personality and character**

Of course first understand which dimensions of your personality are underdeveloped and whether you have a predominantly weak or strong character. Mostly you can figure out for yourself what it takes to train those aspects. The basic idea will always be to “lean into your edge”. The following are my top compound exercises for the mind:

1. **Approach and talk to girls.** Preferably on the street (no reliance on alcohol). Exposure is the one true way. Set yourself a daily or weekly approach target. Measure progress as you do in the gym.
2. **Lift.** Lifting has many benefits, among which stimulating the right chemicals in your brain, feeling your limits, experiencing the spectrum of energy, dominance, focus, and building a strong relationship with yourself. Recommended to have a consistent gym schedule (follow a program and stick to it).
3. **Travel.** And I don’t mean the Instagram hotel exotic far-away destinations. Travel with a tent in your own country. It’s relatively cheap and builds strong independence of mind. Helps you stretch your weakest personality traits ingrained by our comfort society. Helps you put looks, money and status in perspective.

You may be disappointed to see these three above as you’ve *known* them for many years now. But personalities are not built on knowledge. All these exercises require you to overcome discomfort and do it anyway. Therefore they’re ideal for building a stronger character. There’s no magical quick fix pill to it, nor does it take wild, exotic mind-blowing rituals. If you have difficulty connecting with people (and girls specifically), I can only encourage you to go out and observe the effects of these exercises on your mind.

As training a muscular body inspires physical hygiene, training a rich personality inspires a mental one. The latter has come to me rather effortlessly as boundaries on my own bullshit, and that of others. The handful of guys I know who consistently approach girls, lift and make time to travel have this in common, as well as building powerful connections and moistening panties wherever they go.",1645996950.0

Hooked up with this ‘plate’ (now I consider that was just a label, functionally it was closer to a relationship) whilst maintaining a main chick through last term (2mos) of uni. RP aware for about 4 years now, lost my V card at 13 through looks despite being as ASD as they come. I arrogantly and lazily thought I wouldn’t catch feelings though sleeping with the plate basically every night, not seeing the harm in letting her stay and letting her make pancakes each morning. Only felt the full force of them once she went and wasn’t coming back - stupidly (and knowingly stupidly) messaged her to talk about it with a small goddamn essay (the pain had become intolerable in that moment, the drinking with friends almost certainly making that worse). Big lesson in how to maintain frame after breakups there - avoid things (substances or actions) which will take a hammer to said frame. 

Maintained frame well through term with classic effect, her messaging me to initiate every day, submission, blank cheque in bed, all the good stuff. Lose it over the vacation and with the extended break at the start she calls it off over ‘workload’. My guess is her 3 year ex came back into the picture as a photo of them got restored just before I got blocked. She denies this more furiously than anything else; all the more reason for it to be true. 

We both have University sport commitments today, get back and meet in a club, I’m entering just as she’s leaving. Gives me the same bs lines despite almost immediately going for physical contact and then dipping. Could have dismissed the lies in stronger terms in review but was difficult to focus on that in the moment given the feeling of seeing her for the first time in 3 months. Excuse? Maybe, still true though. I’m still trying to derive lessons from this beyond don’t think you’re above the rules and frame is everything.

But above all, you men who maintain frame and go no contact with more invested, hats off to you. If you’re engaged, married, or god forbid have kids and still manage to resist that impulse to reach out, rationalise and solve in an attempt to soothe the pain, I don’t know how you do it and you should know it’s an incredible act of resolve. If that helps lift your clouds a little today, mission accomplished.

Oh well, another date tomorrow, and three more through the coming week. Main chick is fine, will be good to see her in a relationship with better frame.

167,36 Questions that Lead to Love,123,t1f34p,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/t1f34p/36_questions_that_lead_to_love/,39,"TLDR: Is it wise to play the 36 questions game with a first date? 

What’s up boys. I have been pretty successful recently setting up a couple first dates for this weekend and this upcoming week.

There is a tool that I wish to get your opinions on. It is called the 36 questions that lead to love. Some of you may know what they are, others may not. For those of you who don’t know.

The so-called 36 questions to fall in love are a set of questions developed in the 1990s by psychologists Arthur Aron, Ph.D., Elaine Aron, Ph.D., and other researchers to see if two strangers can develop an intimate connection just from asking each other a series of increasingly personal questions. The experiment became massively popular after the New York Times Modern Love column published an essay by Mandy Len Catron in 2015 about her experience trying the questions with an acquaintance whom she went on to marry.

The questions come in 3 sets and they are pretty intimate and personal questions. An example of set one :

Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?

Would you like to be famous? In what way?

Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why?

What would constitute a ""perfect"" day for you?

When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?

If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want?

Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?

Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common.

For what in your life do you feel most grateful?

If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?

Take four minutes and tell your partner your life story in as much detail as possible.

If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?


As you can see these questions can really make a person open. My question to all of you is would you consider doing this question experiment or game with a girl on a first date. Years ago I did it with an ex on a third date I believe and me and her ended up “falling in love” a few months later

That’s my experience with it and I am debating on whether or not to use it again.

168,Picking Up A Dancer,89,t0tl5c,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/t0tl5c/picking_up_a_dancer/,75,"Took home a lovely woman from the bar last night.

She opted for an awkward seat in my peripheral vision. Taking off her jacket, I grab a gander, realizing she is a ""yes.""

A couple minutes go by of feeling her eyes on me but not trying to get caught looking. She sneezes, I say bless you. After her thankyou, I ask her with a grin, ""Drinking alone tonight?""

""Looks like you're doing the same."" So why don't you come grab this seat next to me so neither of us have to drink alone on a Wednesday night.

I just start picking at her life, letting her do the majority of the talking. Throwing in bit of relevant information here and there. Letting silence hang over us when the conversation died. Light touching and teasing through out.

The two guys I was waiting for show up after 45 minutes of banter. When she got up to powder her nose, I lean over to my boy, ""Listen, I don't remember her name. When she gets back introduce yourself and ask her name.""



He throws a light shot at my lack of manners, then I steam roll, introducing her to everyone else who trickled in with our crew of eight. We're throwing darts, so I invite her back. Intentionally sitting away from her at first.

Ended up sitting on a stool behind her. She was spinning around, told me ""you're too close."" As my legs prevented her from making a full revolution. Started bouncing her clockwise to counter clockwise but she wasn't having it.

She moved her seat so I started spinning her faster, eventually too fast to the point she fell off into my lap, cuddling up for a minute.

Night goes on, my crew slowly grew then took off in pairs. I taught her how to shake for shots. She told me she loved my scarf. So I put it around her neck.

After awhile I ask for it back, when she refused, I grabbed the ends, pulling her in for a kiss. She came close but shut me down.

Throwing in some quip about being a tease, she informs me ""it's my job, I'm a dancer after all.""

Now some guys might have felt had but I let her keep my scarf. We grab a seat at the bar with some other folks I knew. Her legs are constantly on my seat, mine on hers. We're both escalating kino.

Eventually I go for it again, except this time wrapping the scarf once around her neck, applying a bit of a choke and we start making out at the bar for fifteen seconds.

After that it's over, she's on my lap. Constantly touching me the rest of the night. We closed down the bar, I walk her to her car. Kiss her and ask are we going to your place or mine?

Mine it is. She talked a bit of shit walking into my bedroom because I don't have a bed, I sleep in a hammock.  Once in it tho, she fell in love with the uniqueness.

In the morning she couldn't get enough of me. We discussed the fact she was looking at me before she even sat down.

She agreed. 

We discussed the fact she knew I was going to fuck her the minute I said bless you, making the decision it was happening that night when she realized I wasn't alone, only waiting on people.

Wish I'd have pushed faster as there was no need for me to close the bar down to take her home.",1645759470.0

170,Should You Cold Approach or Use Tinder?,91,sz5o2r,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/sz5o2r/should_you_cold_approach_or_use_tinder/,70,"I've seen this this question a lot – should I hit on girls in person, or use Tinder/Hinge?

Answer will usually be both – learn to get good at BOTH, and then see which one you prefer. Or you’ll likely find you like both methods.

If you’re currently only doing one or the other, if you start doing both, you’ll massively open up your potential dating pool. A lot of girls aren’t on Tinder – you’ll only meet them in person. And a lot of girls aren’t interested in hooking up with random strangers on the street they don’t even know – they want to vett you on Tinder first.

So use both.

As for types of girls – some guys find they get hotter girls in person. I hear that a lot. Me personally I get hotter girls on Tinder – because my pics are extremely sexual (I have BDSM pics). If your pics aren’t decent yet on Tinder, you’ll likely get hotter girls in person. And if you get really decent pics, you might find you get hotter girls on there.

But again, do both. If you don’t get many matches on Tinder, don’t quit – [improve your pics](https://killyourinnerloser.com/tinder-guide/), a little at a time.

Some guys hate on Tinder/online dating – thinking you’re “not a real man” if you do it. Don't agree, obviously, but I do get where they’re coming from, even if they’re clumsy and childlike in their expression.

There was a really long period of time where I was convinced getting laid online was the “coward’s way”, and real men hit on girls out on the street. I really would have felt like a pussy, or like I was cheating, if I got laid online and neglected learning to get good at talking to chicks on the street.

Once I got laid a bit from cold approach (not a lot – 9 times in total), I felt like I’d satisfied my ego enough and proven to myself I could do it. Then I started focusing on what I really wanted (having lots of sex and exploring my sexual bucketlist) – online was the best way to do that.

Again – that’s why I recommend you learn to get good at both. If you’re terrified of talking to girls in person, run towards that fear and overcome it. Conquering your fears makes you feel like a man.

As for some more differences between the two:

* Online dating once you get good at it, requires NO effort to get laid. It’s easy mode.
* But there’s an initial investment period with online dating – gotta learn how to take great pics, learn how Tinder works, etc
* In person makes you feel like more of a man – because you’re legitimately doing something 99.99% of other guys cannot do.
* I recommend every guy learns how to get laid in person – even if you ultimately end up doing what I’ve done and move to solely online dating and Tinder/Hinge.
* For the last couple of years I’ve been super happy doing Tinder/Hinge only – when you’re having 3somes, the occasional 4some, and banging basically TOO MANY new girls with zero effort from Tinder, I don’t personally get much benefit from talking to girls in person anymore.
* But for newbies and anyone who hasn’t done in person, go get good at that.
* There’s also carry-over from getting good at cold approach; it’ll make you a more confident man overall, you’ll be better at dates (even with Tinder girls), you’ll be more ballsy and more able to pull the trigger.
* Tinder you can be more hookup-focused; I literally show girls in my Tinder photos and bio that I’m looking for BDSM. So I can bang them within 15 minutes of meeting them and do wild kinky BDSM shit with them – something you aren’t going to do as quickly with cold approach.
* In that regard, Tinder is the best place to explore your sexual kinks and get more sexual experience overall.
* Can still do all that shit with a cold approach girl; there’s just less up-front screening, which usually means a little more effort before you get to the BDSM part. Eg maybe you have to hangout for an hour or two on a first date before you go back and do wild kinky filthy shit.

\-

Cold approach and online dating are both absolutely solid ways to get laid, find a girlfriend, get more sexual experience and hookup with some cuties.

So go out there and do both.",1645583156.0
171,"The power and importance of the word ""No""",247,syn3iy,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/syn3iy/the_power_and_importance_of_the_word_no/,20,"The most important word in gaming is the word “no.” You must occasionally say no to women, and ensure they do not say no to you. 

In his classic book “How to Win Friends and Influence People,” Dale Carnegie pointed out that the word “no” is more than just a word, it is an emotional reaction. According to Carnegie, when a person says “no” the following happens: 

*The entire organism—glandular, nervous, muscular—gathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is, usually in minute but sometimes in observable degree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on guard against acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person says “Yes,” none of the withdrawal activities takes place. The organism is in a forward - moving, accepting, open attitude.* 

For this reason, Carnegie recommends that salesmen only ask questions they know the customer will say “yes” to. By putting the person in a “yes” mood, they make the person more likely to buy the product. 

The same principle holds true in game. Do not ask her for anything or escalate the interaction until you feel like she is going to say “yes.” For example, do not invite her to go to another bar with you or invite her back to your house until you feel like she has emotionally invested enough in you to want to go home with you. Every time she says no, the less emotionally invested she will feel and the more likely she will be to say no again. As Carnegie pointed out, “Get a student to say ‘No’ at the beginning, or a customer, child, husband, or wife, and it takes the wisdom and the patience of angels to transform that bristling negative into an affirmative.”

There is another important reason to ensure she does not say no. With respect to the power dynamic, the alpha gives orders and the beta takes orders, which means the alpha says no and the beta does not say no. Therefore, if she starts saying “no” to you, her subconscious mind stops seeing you as the alpha. Generally speaking, if a woman says no to you more than 2 or 3 times in a row, for any reason, she is drifting away and you should maybe even end the interaction. 

When and for what reason you say no is not that important – what matters more is that she feels the EMOTION of you saying no and that she feels, on a subconscious level, you are not following her orders. Sometimes I say no to innocuous, silly things just to generate the right subconscious emotion. And because the power of “no” exists purely in the realm of subconscious emotions, you cannot let her conscious mind know that you are intentionally saying “no.” She must feel that your “nos” are natural and genuine. And of course, sometimes you will be forced to say “yes” just as a practical matter – that’s ok – you can make up for it by saying “no” to other things.

172,"The Classic ""Theory"" of Alpha F's, Beta Buxx Explained In Depth, With Studies. And Why ""Attracting"" Women With Your Money, Is The Worst Possible Thing You Can Do.",350,sx5pkf,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/sx5pkf/the_classic_theory_of_alpha_fs_beta_buxx/,81,"To start this off, I have known a lot of men who have chosen their careers solely on the base to attract women. Majority of these guys aren't what you call a ""Chad"". They're average looking as majority of men. And when a man is average in looks, he instinctively knows he just can't attract women solely based on how he looks. So, what does he do? He tries to acquire more wealth, and status, in hopes to make women attracted to him, so he can make up for his lack of ""chad-ness."" But in the long run it never works, because she wasn't physically attracted to him in the first place. She was only with him because he was that long term ""safe option."" 


According to this study, [women find 80% of men unattractive.](https://blog.timesunion.com/kristi/2016/02/22/about-80-percent-of-men-unattractive-women-say/) 80% is a huge number. And I bet, majority of you have heard about the 20/80 rule, where 20 percent of guys, get 80% of the women and this study proves it. 


With the invention of the internet, women now have more options than ever on tap. The world has become very fast paced and technologically advanced, and it's not the 1800s anymore where you live on a farm, and marry some girl in your town who you knew all your life because of having very limited options. With the advent of the internet and the amount of attention men give women on it, even a very obese women will have her dms flooded. When a women gets constant attention and sees the ""Chad's"" on social media, she will inflate her value to something which she's not and think she's entitled to the ""best."" And, this is majority of women as study's show.


Remember the term, ""Alpha fûçks, beta buxx?"" If I was to simplify all these pills into one sentence, the conclusion of it all would be that one simple statement. According to many studies, [I link one here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2009.00570.x)



>whereas men prefer youth and physical attractiveness in their partners, women give more weight to partners’ earning potential and commitment to a relationship. Evolutionary research does suggest that these sex differences in mating preferences tend to diminish or even disappear when short-term mating contexts are primed. 


 When it comes to short term mating, women do not base him off, of his long term ability to ""protect"" her. Think of the jocks/chads back in school. Those guys were laying the most pipe and were the ""players."" Were they rich? Not necessarily. They had 10/10 genetics combined and due to this, women were attracted to them. 


 [Women want men who are wanted by other women.](https://www.maxim.com/maxim-man/men-who-have-girlfriends-are-hotter-2018-1/) Why? Because when women know other women want him, her 🐱 will go like, ""What does he have, that other women want him so much?"" Women love the chase, and because these guys give her the tingles, she can never get enough of it.  But those ""relationships"" last short term, because these guys have so many options, they never needed to ""commit"" exclusively to one women. They were getting pussy left and right. Women want ""chad"" or the ""bad boy"" in the short run. In summary, by the time women want an ""economically attractive man"" is because the ""physically attractive men"" won't settle with them. So the economically attractive man is the ""second best"" and ""safe option"" simply put. This is it all simplified in one sentence.



The gist of the ""chad theory"" which is proven by many studies is, women will not make rules for the guy that she really wants. For example, you have women saying they want a 100k wedding, 20k ring and a high 6 figure earner and this and that. But... Even these women instinctively know, all the rules which she has made, she will break all of them for a **guy that she really wants**. [Women make rules for betas and break rules for alphas.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886920301537?via%3Dihub) And you might be thinking, who's the guy she really wants? Think of Christian Grey in the ""50 Shades of Grey."" A ""chad"" who has status, all the money in world, and knows how to dominate and put her in her place in bed. Or, think of Christian Bale in the ""American Psycho."" A mysterious, ""hawt"" very cunning guy, who knows exactly what to say and how to get her in bed begging for him, and has many girls after him which make women want him even more, and he always remains aloof and stoic as a stone. And he's a true psychopath.



 This is the man all women secretly dream to have, and there are only a very few percentage of them. Behind their fake mask of feminism, lies such perverted fantasies that they don't say because they know, they would be seen as Hypocrites. And studies [prove women love psychotic men.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-019-00213-0)



Then you have the ""nice guys finish last theory"" which is also proved by many studies. [Here's one.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407518790103) And this is where a good portion of men fall into. Because they aren't ""chad"", they will somehow cope their way and try to become wealthy and acquire status to attract women. They think, because they are a doctor making 200k and having status, they will get quality potentials, but guess what? When you call yourself a doctor, in a women's eyes you're a ""lifelong comfortable income"" safe option. 



The men who get pùssy, will get it either way, if they have money or not. I have known many broke ""Chad's"" slaying right and left. Heck a place where I worked as a waiter, there was a ""chad"" dishwasher, who was slaying all the hot waitresses. When there's a guy who women really want, she doesn't look at his financial status, job, or whatever, even if he's broke and is a simple ""dishwasher.""



When she makes the rules for you, whether it's going out on expensive dinners which you pay for, wanting you to pay for a huge wedding, and this and that, remember this is something to be ashamed about. You're a ""beta buxx"" in her eyes. The guy who makes her pùssy wet, she will get down on her knees for him in no time, and ""break"" all the rules which she had made. Studies prove this time and time, yet, men can't handle it. Next time when someone calls any of these pills a ""theory"", remember to show them the studies. All these pills aren't theories, rather, their science and there are all the studies done in the world, to prove them correct. We the ""redpillers"" know this ""sCiEnCe"" more better than anyone else.


Society has programed men to be raised up as the ""safe option with money"" when it comes to attracting women. Many of these guys just study, study and study, and have no life, and think by getting a good job will give them the dream marriage. Wanna know something harsh? The guys who get women, will get them either way. What makes her pussy wet in the short term, vs what she wants in the long term (financial and emotional security) are two totally different things. And she can't settle with ""chad"" (who makes her pussy wet in the short term) because he has too many options, and she instinctively knows he will be unreliable. So, she settles for a sucker like you who thinks, ""My money will make her so attracted to me, and I will have a good sex life and all that.""


But guess what? Your sex life will be like of dèadbedrooms. She wasn't attracted to you physically, she only wanted you for your money. And majority of these marriages end up in divorce, [with 85% of women calling it quits. ](https://archive.is/VBF1v)


**Just remember, physical attraction is number one.** No matter on the contrary what fèmìnists say of how, they want a guy with good ""pErSoNaLiTy or nIcEnEsS"" is all nonsense. If you really take fèmìnists seriously, then I'm sorry, you're a joke. If they were truly ""fèmìnists"" [majority of them wouldn't have forced sèx or ra-pè fantasies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224490609552336) Taking fèminísts seriously is equivalent to taking sleepy/dimentia Joe as the President of this country. It's pathetic and unrealistic.


The guy who makes that pussy tingle, she will not make him go through all the hoops and hurdles to obtain that pussy, even though he doesn't have money or ""status."" She will signal him, and because he knows how to read those signals, he will be fucking her in no time. While beta billy? He had to make the list and go through all the hoops and hurdles that she had set up for him, only for her to manipulate him with sex and little does he know, he's only her ""safe good guy long term option.""


In conclusion, unplug yourself from the blue pìll fantasy matrix, research and read the studies, and don't be her ""safe option with money"" who will be manipulated by her with sex, and will be low-key miserable. Look around, the pills are everywhere in the real world. You're just too blind to see it. Have some self respect, honour and dignity, and be wise. Women are like a side Remember ""Don't pay attention to what women say, pay attention to what they do."" And, oh, never fucking marry. 

That's all.

173,Pretentious pillars of modern feminism,151,swudyy,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/swudyy/pretentious_pillars_of_modern_feminism/,25,"**About this essay**: This essay attempts to discuss the theories (or dogmas) on which the modern feminist narrative(or movement) rests, the fundamentals which provide this movement its goals if they can be called “goals”. This essay also challenges the validity and truthfulness of the same while providing examples that suggest that the hypotheses on which the movement is based are wrong. Statistical and scientific evidence has been provided from credible sources if found(references are at the bottom).

*I hope you get some value from this. If you think that there are better versions of this post, please skip it and add the link to that in the comments.*

## Dogmas that shaped the movement

The beliefs or theories that shaped the modern feminist movement are to be trusted and accepted as truth. Anyone questioning the authenticity of it or requesting proofs of the said theory are branded as “enemies of a progressive society”. These theories or dogmas are so powerful that they had significant real-life consequences and had negatively affected numerous people. Here are some of the fundamental ones which gave birth to a lot more theories that were unopposed that pushed the modern feminist movement forward.

1. **Men and women are the same**: The only place where this phrase can be said truly is, “men and women are same in the eyes of the law of the land”. It means that they have the same fundamental rights, have the same fundamental duties towards the land, and will face similar consequences when they break the law. It also means that there should be “equality in opportunity based on competence and merit”, but the last part often gets lost in translation. (In today’s west, women have more rights than a man.)  
Men are women are not the same biochemically and that manifests in their psychological and physiological behaviors as well. For instance, men and women react differently to the same situations, their bodies react differently to the same substances. For example, when stressed, the prefrontal cortex of men gets activated and in the case of women, it is the limbic system (Verma, n.d.). Another example could be the short and long-term impact of alcohol on their bodies, how either gender perceives sex, or susceptibility of dysregulation of hormones as they age. In each of those categories and many more, men and women are different and it does affect their physical lives, even though the post-modernists would like to believe otherwise.  
This dogma has given birth to numerous other similar lies that have proceeded to ruin the very fabric of society. Men who questioned this were misinterpreted vastly. One crucial thing it had done was it put men and women on the same race track. It had a lot of positive outcomes and the negative outcomes are often ignored; an analysis of that deserves an essay of its own. For instance, transgender athletes dominate women’s sports and break records. Of course, the absolute failures of this dogma were blamed on men, for example, men are shamed for not wanting to marry the particular type of women(single mothers, hyper-successful women, women who are older and looking to settle down) by being labeled as “insecure” and “not a real man”.
2. **Women, in history, had a terrible time as compared to men**: This conclusion is reached by giving more importance to the suffering of women and attributing that to men. On the contrary, the suffering of the man was attributed to a “different time”. For instance, most of the factory workers, construction workers, miners, repairmen, soldiers, firemen, police officers were(and still are) men and they have sacrificed 10 hours a day for 30 years of their life to build the current world we live in. This is just considered a man’s duty. However, a woman living in a household, reasonably safe and secure, is considered as a slave of her man because she was “stuck” at home taking care of the children and cooking meals.  
Another reason this dogma exists is that modern feminists compare the sufferings of both the sexes in the past and (obviously) are more sympathetic to women, primarily to victimize themselves(through those women who have *actually* suffered) and gain whatever they could by accusing the society of misogyny.  
For a significant amount of time in history, most *people* were slaves and had next to zero rights. They were born and died in chains. Only a tiny percentage of people enjoyed everything, but there were still diseases, wars, and famines. Until very recently, the world was very unsafe and dangerous for a multitude of reasons. Men dealt with the problems outside, women supported men by playing their part. It should also be noted that men in history died young and plenty. The struggles of both genders were(and still are) different because apart from a few things men and women are very different.
3. **Gender (roles) is a social construct**: This axiom that shaped the modern feminist movement was the final nail on the coffin. All of the things that existed about the nature and roles of men and women in society were turned upside down by implying that the society itself actively suppressed the potential for women to forge their independent identity.  
Characteristics of people create culture and culture creates a society. The characteristics of people are really dependent on the individual and their behavior, which is directed by our biochemistry. All of it was to be disregarded because of a dogma suggested by a bunch of arts graduates who already believed that it was the society that was suppressing them in their quest to attain glory.  
“But women are repelled by the society when they want to grow”. It is the same for men as well. It is not that men are born and doors just keep opening for us. Rejection is a fundamental part of a man’s daily life. Competitors, ill-wishers, and life, in general, will definitely come on the way as obstacles between anyone and their goal. It doesn’t mean that society is conspiring against you by crafting rules to obstruct you. For instance, men are made fun of for their appearance but most sob stories about body shaming come from women. An act that is blamed on men even though women do it much more.

*The three axioms that have been described above are interrelated. One supports the other two and anyone who asks about the authenticity of one could be answered with a version of other dogmas. There might be more, but I believe that these three were the primary ones that gave birth to other ones. I am looking forward to receiving more fundamental theories that could be directing this “revolution”. A lot of drastic changes are introduced into society as a result of that and it affected the dating world as well.*

*In the unfortunate event where you find yourself in a situation where you encounter someone who is a firm believer of the above theories and can’t tell them off, just ask them on what basis they have reached that conclusion. More often than not the best thing they can say is, “this is how society is supposed to be anyway”, which is a whole different discussion altogether.* 

## Aim of the modern feminism movement

In the age where most of the college students in the west are women (*Erudera College News* 2021) and the number of female students in different colleges across the world is drastically increasing by the year and the proportion of male students are in the decline, the number of protesters who take it to the streets to fight for women have been alarmingly increasing.

Not only that, the number of women who are CEOs, entrepreneurs, thought leaders, professors, politicians are continuing to increase (“8.2% of Fortune 500 CEOs are Women, According to the 2021 Women CEOs in America Report” 2021) with most, if not all, organizations(public and private) facilitating the process of ascension of women in various ways. It might also be argued that the assistance by the government and a lot of NGOs might not be as effective as they have been advertised, it is way better than zero.

This begs the question, “What the modern feminists are fighting for?” What is the grave injustice that the society(or men) is unleashing on them that they are screaming their hearts out on social media and have been marching on the streets for it? Is there any truth to it, or is it all just a sham? Why are they “demanding” things from the patriarchal system if they are all independent, empowered women who refuse to get handouts from anyone, let alone a man?

A woman can get educated in any field they want, reasonable speaking, as it depends on their financial conditions, availability, raw intellect, and discipline. They can also get jobs in any field they want, provided they are competent enough. They are not questioned or told what to do even with a good motive since doing so in the west(and elsewhere) has resulted in men getting branded as “misogynists” for “mansplaining”. It is also to be noticed that women have all the reproductive power in the west, can absolutely ruin a man’s life without laying a finger on him, blatantly lie about her past, be rewarded about her promiscuity, and be celebrated.

Even with all of this newfound freedom of choice, still, majority of difficult jobs are done by men. Military, fire department, special forces, construction, mining, manufacturing, factory workers, researchers in the STEM field, etc., are predominantly managed and operated by men. Women, when given the choice of jobs only choose jobs that they can do in the confines of an air-conditioned room. Of course, modern feminists deem this as “smart” because who would like to work in those conditions and fair play to that, but it still begs the question, “What are modern feminists fighting for”?

*I know that a lot of women in many areas of the world are leading miserable lives with little to no access to education, sanitation, and opportunities to build their independent identities. Unfortunately, modern feminists can’t be bothered with them. They are more concerned with why most of the positions of power(and overwhelming responsibilities) have been occupied by men and why society is not accepting them even though they are only contributing chaos to it. Women who face real issues, like child marriage, lack of proper medical access, are on their own and if they are lucky they are helped by the men in their own families. Most women in India, for example, are open about how much their father had to sacrifice to get them through college. Modern feminists, on the other hand, are focused on something entirely sinister.*

## Wrapping up

Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung had proposed a great way to understand what could be motivating someone to do something. “If you cannot understand why someone did something, look at the consequences—and infer the motivation.”

So what are the consequences of the modern feminist movement?

* **The commodification of sex**: The idea that sex or making love is a way of letting your partner know that you care about them by giving them pleasure and comfort is long lost in the West and is getting worse by the minute. Modern women are firmly believing that they are “giving sex” or “giving access” to a man for which he should bend over backward to fulfill all of her desires. Even in modern relationships, sex has now become a currency, a commodity that females exchange in return for things that seem valuable to them.  
The idea that a man should be “grateful” that he is getting intimacy from his partner is asinine, however, also normalized at the same time. This can be characterized by lots of women becoming “content creators” on websites like OnlyFans and justifying their actions because they are at least getting something out of it (Lim 2022).
* **The number of single mothers**: Almost a quarter (23%) of children in the US are being raised in single-parent households (Kramer 2019). It is also to be noted that 86% of those households are female-led which is unsurprising considering the bias of the Western judiciary in these matters (Zuckerman 2020). Furthermore, the impact of the same on the growth of children in various fields is devastating. Multiple sources have cited that children who grew up in single-parent households are more likely to perform poorly at schools, break the law, and abuse substances. Based on the trends presented in the two sources, the numbers will continue to increase and will eventually decrease as men are walking out of marriage and fatherhood.
* **Plummeting marriage rates**: According to a report from Morgan Stanley, by 2030 45% of working-age women will be single, which was 41% in 2018. Of course, being the publicly left-leaning financial organization Morgan Stanley is, the report is presented in a positive light (“MS\_Print Design\_North America Insight English” 2019). The impact of the same on society has skipped the minds of the authors of the paper. It is also worth noting that the paper relies on ill-formed notions like the gender pay gap and glorifies it as a positive by merely focussing on the economic side of it.   
This paper is also guilty of presenting data in a format that forces people in general and women in particular that being single is the path to happiness as it helps you further your career. Whereas it is true that women devoid of committed relationships grow their careers fast, it is also true that hyper-successful women are left with few options in the dating market for a multitude of reasons, leading to an unsatisfying life.  
Of course, beliefs perpetrating from false statements like, “men are afraid of successful women” make women believe that it is the reason for that. However, women cease to understand that more money makes more doors close for them, and for men, it is the opposite, simply because women choose mates across and above their social hierarchy.

*There are many things in this essay that deserves more concurrent discussion. However, due to my limited intellect and time, I was able to write whatever you have read. Thank you for your time and I hope you gained some value out of it. Please share your observations from life in the comments to enrich this post.*

Now you may say, women want ""chad"" only. Yes, but he doesn't stay around so that's why they end up marrying the ""safe option with money"" who they'll never be truly attracted to. 


First of all, men must acknowledge that in the modern age, there are more women going to school and getting ""educated"" in something than ever, and then they go on to make the national average. [There are more women in post secondary than men.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.1358656) While, most men keep and multiply their wealth, women still only get wealthy by 2 things. That is either through marrying a wealthy man and then divorcing, or they inherit wealth from their father's. [Source 1](https://nypost.com/2019/02/21/marriage-is-still-the-main-way-for-women-to-get-rich-study/), [Source 2.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/21/a-womans-best-route-to-the-top-1-percent-is-to-marry-rich.html) Also, studies show, [women hold more debt](https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/credit-card-debt-is-a-bigger-problem-for-women-vs-men) and are more irresponsible with their money, compared with men. Also, [women hold 2/3 of all student debt.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/13/american-women-hold-two-thirds-of-all-student-debt-heres-why.html)



When a man and woman is making the same, **a woman is biologically programmed to go for a guy who is making more than her, and who is more higher of status, especially, when it comes to choosing a long term partner**. For the short term, they'll screw the guy who makes her 🐱 tingle, and she won't look at his finances/status etc. But for the long term? His finances and his status matter's the most, as studies show. 


 Ironically, when a lot of men and women are making the national average, women then will only go for the men who are in the top 10% money wise. Hence, the 80/20, 90/10 rule come into play. That 80% of women, go for the top 20% of men etc. What you must understand is, biologically, women only care about their survival and the survival of their offspring. [They will choose a man that ensures her and her offsprings survival](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/sexual-selection-13255240/) because women instinctively know, they're too weak to operate alone. 

A smart woman knows, a patriarchal society will benefit and protect her in many ways, no matter on the contrary what their obese fèminíst ""kweens"" say. Feminist ""kweens"" will say that, **women are ""strong, free and independent and don't need men"" but deep down, they know they need men.** If all these men who work at oil fields, construction and who do all the ""dirty labor jobs"" were to stop working for a day, society would collapse.


If women did not need men, then the #1 reason of decline in marriage wouldn't be ""lack"" of economically attractive men. **Women instinctively know, they were created physically and mentally weak and since the cavemen days, they have latched on to whatever high value male they could find, that would ensure their survival and the survival of their offspring.** When the invading tribe warriors came to invade, women latched on the most powerful man they could find that would ""protect"" them, and in return, she provided him sex and children. This was just the way it worked, since the beginning of time. But these days, **women sleep only with the men that they're sexually attracted to, while they only marry someone that is resourceful because the very sèxually attractive guy doesn't stay around.** The study basically proves that, women are gold diggers LOL when it comes to marriage. 


**But every man must understand, rich men don't make her wet.** Meaning, make her sexually attracted towards you. When a women see's any rich or resourceful guy, in her eyes, it's (Yess lifelong comfortable income guy). **By you driving the best car for the validation of women, showing off your wealth and what not, is making yourself look like a fool with a badge that says, ""I'm a beta provider, pick me.""** Of course, why wouldn't any women pick you? You love getting used, and women love using and extracting resources from you, while she will be giving herself away for free to the Alphas. 


**A woman wants a mix of many qualities in a man. She wants him to be a rich Alpha, that will put in her place, while being a ""gentleman"" on the street so ""people"" can say, ""look at that happy couple!""** But little do the beta provider men know, back in her college/university years, she was giving herself away for free to the Chad's/Alpha's. All the Tyrones/Enrico's/Pookies degraded her for free in many ways possible, and now, you have to pay for her because she only looks at your ""financial status"" for marriage.


  Alpha's/Chad's get what they want from a woman, without having to provide anything. They simply don't care. They will pump and dump, while a woman knows that this guy will be unreliable, she will still stay with him in order to ""change"" him. But, he'll never change. Alpha's never stick around, because they have many options. **Women are biologically attracted to unreliable men, because they give her that emotional rollercoaster.** You really think that, after she has experienced an Alpha, she will be happy with a lifelong comfortable income Dr Kareem, who is boring and very predictable? Nope. She will be drier than the Sahara Desert for him and will eventually manipulate him with sex, and use it as a weapon.



 **Women have 2 great needs, which can only be fulfilled by 2 types of men. Their need for sex, and their need for financial security and emotional support.** The need for sex can only be fulfilled by an Alpha, but he's emotionally unavailable, while their need for security can be fulfilled by a beta. (I don't mean to disrespect them as most of them, are actually good hearted and kind men, but for the sake of giving example, I'm calling them 'beta') The beta because, he doesn't have many options and will always be loyal to her, and she knows she can win him over easily and manipulate him. While for an Alpha? **Women will compete to be exclusive to him but little do they know, because he has so many options, he will never stick around. And then, these women get heartbroken and become emotionally broken women. Aka Alpha widowed.** 



Anyways. All men must remember in the modern age, marriage = you're a beta and the statistics show this itself. She will make all the rules for the guy who she wants to marry, while she will break the rules for a guy who she just wants to F. Marriage is a joke in the West. Women can never truly be attracted to their beta buxx hubbies. While she's having sex with him, (if he gets any, other than for procreation) you know what gets her off? Thinking about her past sexathons with the guys who degraded her in all ways possible, and she loved it! While her current husband thinks she's ""pleased"" with him with his 2 stroke special, because he has no experience with women. Brutal for these guys. 


In conclusion, all men must remember, if you marry in the West in the modern age, you're seen as beta in her eyes. She's not attracted to you at all. **She's only attracted to the lifelong comfortable income you have (Not me saying, literally, it's the statistics) and because you're a stable/reliable guy.** She doesn't get wet for you, like how she got wet for her exes. But you? You still think she ""loves"" you, until oh, well, more than 50% of marriages end up in divorce while women initiate 80-90% of divorces.

 And, again, going back to the title of the post, women base their marriage/long term partner off by his income only, but not anything else.**


Tldr; In summary, by the time women want an ""economically attractive man"" is because the ""physically attractive men"" won't settle with them. So the economically attractive man is the ""second best"" and ""safe option"" simply put.",1645027980.0
175,Grow Up or Stay a Child,289,ssg8s8,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ssg8s8/grow_up_or_stay_a_child/,46,"# The Difference Between Boys and Men
Children do two things that separate them from adults. They will always, without exception, exhibit a lack of responsibility for their actions. Also, they will almost never hold themselves personally accountable for the consequences of their actions. Boys will lie, project, blame-shift, deny, gaslight, portray themselves as victims, even do nothing- you name it, all in the name of avoiding ownership of themselves and their choices.

Men, not adult boys, but men, take responsibility for their actions and hold themselves accountable when they realize they've done wrong. Men  do not put their burdens on others to handle, they don't rationalize bad choices, and they don't make strawmen to distract from their failures. They own themselves and take failure as an opportunity to be better than they were.

It is up to parents to instill these values in their children so they can grow up. Where they fail, it is up to those that were failed to finish what their parents started. To grow up.

# Signs of Still Being a Child
Do you like to pretend that things other than yourself are to blame for your circumstances?  Do you make black-and-white comparisons to rationalize your failures? Do you expect others to take care of things for you instead of doing them yourself? Do you attach yourself to ideas to avoid using your brain? Do you find yourself attached to people who validate you? Are you codependent? Do you get angry at the people who hold you accountable? Do you cling to the comfort of not having to be responsible?

If so, you may still be a child.

Men actively seek to root out these weaknesses in their lives. Children avoid it, because they don't want to be responsible. They want others to hold their hand and do the hard work of being responsible for them. They don't want to be their best, they want others to give them what being their best could get them.

Some ""children"" are more grown up than most ""adults."" They take an active role in their improvement and growth- unlike the adult children of our current age. If you don't do that, you may still be a child.

# Growing Up
Did you get hurt badly as a kid? Your parents beat you? Were you sexually assaulted? Were you neglected? Do you have mental disorders or physical handicaps that make your life more difficult? You have an addiction or poor impulse control? Were the women in your life abusive? Been taken advantage of? Betrayed?

So what.

Stop leaning on your past to justify your childhood antics. Take the step into real adulthood by accepting things and moving forward. If you need a therapist, get one. If you need to learn something to get better, learn it. Stop rationalizing it, stop putting your issues at the feet of others, stop justifying your brokenness. The worst thing about adult children is that they justify harming and hurting others with their brokenness. Men don't justify that harm, they actively seek to prevent it.

The only person who can fix you is you.

Grow up.

# Easy Outs to Stay a Child
A lot of boys here like to blame society and women for their lot in life. You hear things like ""women only love men for what they can provide."" Sounds an awful lot like an excuse to not put in the work required to be someone worth loving- and to double up, like an excuse to avoid the work of finding good women in your life. You want to stay in that mindset? Go right ahead, see how far being a child gets you.

""Men can't be emotionally vulnerable."" That sounds an awful lot like an excuse to avoid putting in the work required to handle your issues. Nobody who isn't paid to listen to you whine and bitch about how bad you've got it isn't your therapist. You need that, find a therapist. Laying your emotional baggage at the feet of another man, woman, or God forbid, another child, is garbage. They aren't your therapist and nor should they be.

""Society treats men as expendable."" Okay, so what? You're expendable. Does that mean that you deserve to be catered to and have other people fix your problems? Sounds childish to me. You want others to give you that purpose? To treat you as the expendable creature you believe yourself to be? Go ahead. Nobody can make you make the grown up choice of making yourself who you want to be.

Whatever problem you have, the only person who can make things better for you is you. And that requires one thing- for you to grow up.

# Be a Man
Take ownership of yourself. You need a different environment to thrive? Make one. You need help working with your problems? Get it. But don't get upset with others if they say no or dump you, it's not their responsibility to help you. It's your responsibility to help yourself. Complaining about your situation is something children do. Men do something about it.

Your parents may have failed to make you a man. Not their problem. That's your problem. Grow up. Someone may have done something terrible to you. That's not someone else's problem. It's yours. Grow up.

This may sound harsh; it is. Did anyone deserve to be victimized and traumatized? Of course not. But that's what happened and that's the way it is. Own it. Fix it. You can have the sympathy of your fellows, but that doesn't get you to where you need to be. Grow up.

Do it for yourself.

That may be the one thing everyone deserves. To grow up. But like all things deserved, you only get it if you work for it.

176,Cherchez La Femme – Look For The Woman,208,ssdbni,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ssdbni/cherchez_la_femme_look_for_the_woman/,39,"**Cherchez La Femme**

*“ Cherchez la femme, pardieu! Cherchez la femme!”*

-“The Mohicans of Paris” by Alexandre Dumas.

The French have a wonderful expression: *“Cherchez la femme!”*  It translates as *“Look for the woman.”*  How many times have you known a guy who suddenly starts acting out of character?  How many times is there some new woman in his life when that happens?

Those Frenchies were on to something.

*“Steve never comes out with us anymore.”*

*“Cherchez la femme.”*

*“Tom has quit drinking and has started going to church.”*

*“Cherchez la femme.”*

*“I’m always broke these days.”*

*“Cherchez la femme.”*

In English we would use a far less couth saying: *“His girlfriend is leading him around by the dick.”*  Less poetic, but just as accurate.  


**Beautiful Women Can Make You Do Things You Don’t Want To Do.**

When a woman is particularly beautiful – or when she is your only source of pussy – you may find yourself doing things you don’t want to do, spending money you don’t want to spend, and caving into demands that you don’t want to cave in to.  

Compromise is one thing; appeasement is not.

How does your Uncle Vaz handle such situations?  He dumps the girl.  

Women who hint too strongly or openly about “gifts”?  Dumped.

Women who try to nag me into doing things I have no interest in?  Dumped.

Women who try to strip mine my wallet?  Dumped, hard, at maximum velocity.

And so on.  This becomes much easier to do the more abundance, or at least abundance mentality, that you have.  And when you do, you will feel a weight lifted from you.

What is going on my tombstone? **“If you were maintaining sexual relationships with multiple women, none of this would be a problem.”**

I once broke up with a woman who went on to become a Playboy Playmate because we were making each other crazy.  More specifically because she was making *me* crazy with her ridiculous demands and I was making her more so because she wasn't used to guys pushing back on her crazy, which I did, hard.  She had a habit of threatening to leave if I didn’t comply.

So I called her bluff.


**Calling Her Bluff**

Call her bluff, *but* you have to be ready to walk, which in this case, I was.  There was just so much chaos.

Her: *“Well I will just go back home then!”*

Me: *“Ok.  Maybe you should.”*

She never saw this coming and immediately switched into crisis mode because replacing me wasn’t going to be easy.  She started peppering me with questions about my likes and dislikes, if only to fill the silence.  The second or third one was, for some unknown reason, about whether I liked golf or not.  I have no idea why, other than she was flailing around.  I mean, golf is fine for those who like it, but that does not include me.  

I replied, with a chuckle, *“Have you ever seen golf clubs at my house?  Have you ever heard me mention golf once in conversation?  You don’t really know me at all, do you?”*

Anyway, she was visiting for another day or so, and in order to preserve the peace, I waited to dump her, and then I did.  

Her: *""Guys don't break up with me!""*

Me: *""I just did.""*

Also Me: *""You can’t be happy with things.  I’ve seen how upset that you get.  And it’s making me crazy, too.  Why keep torturing each other.""*

The Coup de Grace: *""We’re both good matches, just not for each other.""*

^ This (sometimes) takes the sting of rejection out of, well, rejection.


Subsequently, she tried to get back together with me, I think for the sole purpose of pulling off a ""revenge breakup"", but I declined.  Sure, I probably could have fucked her again, but I have to at least *like* the girl as a person and she had burned that out of me.  She made sure that I knew she became a Playmate, and texted me to tell me, in a backhanded way, that she was engaged - a *""Look what you missed out on!""* move.  She later dumped that fiancé, got another one, dumped him, and moved on again, as I understand it.  She's also on either her 2nd or 3 set of implants.   Wherever she is, I hope she is doing well, but I suspect she is as unhappy as ever.


**Takeaways**

-Do not do things you do not want to do, especially as a result of coercion

-Having more than one option for getting pussy will make your life easier in so many ways. 

-Call her bluff, but be ready to walk

178,How to Take the Lead Without Being Controlling,139,spoxe1,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/spoxe1/how_to_take_the_lead_without_being_controlling/,10," I've heard the question: “How do I differentiate between taking the lead and being masculine… vs being too controlling?” Or put more simply, “How can I take the lead without turning into a control freak?”

Easy – by taking the lead and asking for her input, before making the final decision. You’re the captain of the ship, but she’s your first mate.

It looks like this:

1) Take the lead by initiating the conversation.

2) Ask for her input, listen to it and take it into consideration.

3) Make the final decision.

An example:

You: “I’m hungry, let’s go get some food. How’s pizza?”

Her: “That sounds really good, I’d love pizza.”

You: “Cool, let’s go.”

In this example, she’s completely happy to go along with your plans (most of the time, most girls are happy to go with the flow) – but you still gave her a chance to give a bit of input. You asked her, “How’s pizza?” If she really didn’t want pizza, you gave her a chance to tell you, and you would have picked something else. But you still took the lead by offering pizza in the first place.

So, you took the lead – while still asking for her input. That’s all you ever have to do in order to not be controlling – just ask for a bit of input.

Compare that to an example of being too controlling:

You: “I’m hungry. We’re going to go get pizza.”

Her: “Oh, ok.”

In this example, you obviously haven’t even offered her a choice. You’ve told her what you’re both going to do. Sometimes chicks dig that – especially in the bedroom. But if you do it all the time, and never give her a chance to give some input, that’s when you stray over into controlling territory.

It’s also possible to go too far in the other direction, and ask for too much input, whilst also not even bothering to take the lead. An example:

You: “I’m hungry. What do you think we should eat?”

Her: “I don’t know. What do you feel like?”

You: “I don’t know, what do you feel like?”

Her: “I’m happy to eat anything, so let’s pick whatever you like.”

You: “No I’m happy to go anywhere as well, so tell me what you want.”

Her: “Umm…”

Yeah. Shit. I’ve seen so many guys do this – they won’t even bother trying to take the lead, and they basically dump it on the girl, expecting her to make all the decisions. 99% of girls don’t find your complete lack of direction very attractive.

So hit that middle ground – [take the lead](https://theinnerwinnershow.com/150) and offer a plan/solution, ask for her input on it, then make your final decision.

For bigger decisions (eg decisions that are more important than just where you’re going to eat dinner), I like to explain the rationale behind my final decision. Particularly if my final decision is different to what she said she wants. I’ll talk it through with her, show her where I’m coming from, make it clear to her I took her input on board, and explain why I’ve chosen a different decision. If you want someone to go with your idea rather than their own, explaining the rationale behind your decision is the only way to get them on board so they’re not resentful.

I also like explaining my thought process to people for the reason that it helps me think through why I’ve made a particular decision so I’m more sure about it. And it’s a brilliant teaching moment, especially if you’re dating younger or more shy/less assertive girls. A lot of them literally don’t have the tools to easily make decisions yet; I like to teach them those tools, give them little techniques on being more assertive.

A lot of times a girl will give me her input and it’s immediately clear if we went with her suggestion, it’d be a bad idea. In those cases, I’ll take a bit of time to explain why her suggestion wouldn’t work, and then I’ll give her a chance to come up with a better decision with me. Or, I’ll pick a better decision, and again explain my rationale and thought process behind it so she doesn’t feel like I’m just rejecting her idea and steamrolling over the top of her.

If all this sounds like a lot of work, don’t stress – a lot of this stuff only applies once you’ve been seeing a girl for a while. Early on, particularly on the first couple of dates, most girls will be fully ok with you taking the lead and making almost all of the decisions – as long as you make a token gesture to get her input. Again, even just a casual, “Does that sound good?” is perfect. As in, “Let’s grab a drink at 6pm at \[this bar\]. Does that sound good?”

As I said earlier, I’ve also seen some guys over-worry about “being controlling”, and go too far in the other direction, and end up not taking the lead at all. Remember, as the man it’s your “job” to take the lead, so to speak. 99% of women don’t like taking the lead; they prefer you to do it.

After you’ve had sex with a girl, you then want to continue taking the lead. When you next want to meet up with her, it’s up to you to send the message saying, “Hey cutie, free tomorrow night at 6pm?” and then inviting her over to your place to bang again. You should always be the one planning dates/sex/hangouts – of course, allowing her the room to give her input if she wants to. And let’s be clear, you should be steering things towards what you want – whether that’s a fuckbuddy situation, a relationship, whatever. 99.9% of girls want a man who leads; they’re very happy following a guy who (appears to) know what he wants. As long as you ask for a bit of input along the way, most girls are very happy to go with what you want to do, 95% of the time.

And don’t feel like you always have to know exactly what you want. It’s ok to be unsure sometimes. I don’t always know exactly what I want. In those cases, you can still lead by initiating the conversation and asking for her input. The very act of initiating the conversation is taking the lead. An example: “Hey I’ve been thinking we should try something new and fun in the bedroom. What’s some things you’ve always wanted to try?” 

So again, taking the lead doesn’t mean you’re controlling. Taking the lead doesn’t mean you never ask for input. I ask for input all the time, especially with my girlfriend (someone I’ve been seeing for a few years now). The longer you date a girl, the more you’ll start to ask for her input; the more you’ll respect her input.

Girls will love you for being masculine enough to take the lead, but also considerate/decent enough to always give them an opportunity to tell you if they really don’t like your plan. You’re going to find just by allowing them the chance to give input if they want to, 99% of the time they’ll just say, “I’m happy with your plan, let’s do it”. The fact you keep the door open to her input is what makes her trust your judgement and what makes her more likely to just defer to whatever you suggest.

So:

Take the lead.

Ask for her input, take it into consideration.

Make the final decision.",1644549620.0

In addition to being a strong predictor of women’s infidelity, women’s number of lifetime sexual partners has a strong positive association with relationship instability, relationship dissatisfaction, including marital and sexual dissatisfaction, and the likelihood of divorce. [Busby, Willoughby, & Carroll (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1111/pere.12009) set out to determine whether the number of sexual partners was associated with poor relationship outcomes while controlling for relationship length, education, race, income, age, and religiosity.

[Rhoades and Stanley (2014)](http://nationalmarriageproject.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NMP-BeforeIDoReport-Final.pdf) found that the more sexual partners a woman had had before marriage, the less happy she reported her marriage to be ([excerpt](https://archive.md/FdLsd)). Particularly alarming was a graph they sent to the Washington Post, indicating that <25% of women with 10+ partners reported higher quality marriages compared to >40% of women with <10 partners ([graph](https://archive.md/EvBYN/d093dbfc1eea588883fa7825e0fdadbc3e724e6f.png)).

Using CDC’s NSFG data collected in 2002, 2006-2010, and 2011-2013, [Wolfinger (2016)](https://archive.md/Mj4eo) found that women with 10 or more partners were the most likely to divorce, with the highest 5-year year divorce rates (33% compared to [~20%](https://archive.md/MV3Qx) for women in general) ([screenshot](https://archive.md/auPtQ)). In a longitudinal study, [Jackson et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2018-200230) found that women with 10 or more partners were over fourteen times likelier to be divorced or separated than women with one partner and over twice as likely to be divorced or separated than women with 2 to 4 partners ([excerpt](https://archive.md/141ib)). Using regression analysis, [Kelly and Conley (1987)](https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.52.1.27) found that prenuptial variables like the wife’s premarital sexual activities are a major predictor of marital satisfaction, with women who divorced early in life having more premarital romantic and sexual experience than the stably married women ([excerpt](https://archive.md/XfJIm)). [Penke and Asendorpf (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.95.5.1113) confirmed the prediction that women who had more experience with short-term relationships in the past were more likely to have multiple sexual partners and unstable relationships in the future ([excerpt](https://archive.md/mS37I)).  [Cohen and Manning (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.04.011) affirmed that women who had sex with someone besides their husband had a higher risk of marital dissolution—women who had multiple premarital partners aside from their husband had significantly higher odds of marital dissolution ([excerpt](https://archive.md/0nIKr)).

> Those with a more unrestricted sociosexuality — meaning those who were more inclined towards casual sex — tended to begin their marriages less satisfied and remain less satisfied over time. And people with more unrestricted partners tended to experience steeper declines in satisfaction, which in turn predicted marital dissolution.

> “When people couple up, they (and their partners) enter into relationships with their own personal relationship histories — if those histories include a cast of previous ‘no-strings-attached’ sexual partners and/or acceptance toward casual sex, then staying in a satisfying, long-term relationship (such as marriage) may be more difficult,” French told PsyPost.

[Essock-Vitale and McGuire (1985)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0162-3095(85\)90027-5) found that women who reported having sex with other men while married had significantly more sexual partners (24.5 vs. 3.9) than women who reported no extramarital affairs ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/RTnooIN.jpg)). [Whisman and Snyder (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1037/0893-3200.21.2.147) surveyed nearly five thousand married women and determined that the probability of sexual infidelity increases with the number of lifetime sexual partners, with as high as a 13% increase in the annual prevalence of infidelity per additional lifetime sexual partner ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/ZhxoqNv.jpg)). However, [Treas and Giesen (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00048.x) estimated only a 1% increase in the net odds of infidelity for each additional sex partner between the ages of 18 and first marital union ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/poSLp4U.jpg)). In their study of how premarital sexual behaviors affect post-marital adjustment, [Athanasiou and Sarkin (1974)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01541486) found that respondents who reported extensive premarital sexual experience generally reported extensive extramarital activity, with the number of premarital partners showing positive associations with the number of extramarital partners, the desire to engage in mate-swapping activities, and lower marital satisfaction ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/gtTOhE9.jpg)). [Forste and Tanfer (1996)](https://doi.org/10.2307/353375) examined sexual exclusivity among dating, cohabiting, and married women, and found that unmarried women with 4+ partners were 8.5 times more likely to have a secondary sex partner than a woman with no previous sex partners, and married women with 4+ partners were 20x more likely to have secondary partners ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/naqmXdN.jpg)). It should be noted that this category is wildly skewed by women with a double digit number of partners, who are significantly more likely to stray.

One’s number of lifetime sexual partners wasn’t just highly correlated with marital infidelity but with relational infidelity as well. [Feldman and Cauffman (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0903_1) found in their study of adolescents that sexual permissiveness promotes sexual activity with a larger number of partners, which, in turn, increases the chance that sexual betrayal will occur ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/R84WjSe.jpg)). In their study of infidelity in heterosexual dating couples, [Barta and Kiene (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0265407505052440) found that individuals reporting a past history of infidelity tended that have a greater number of sexual partners than those without a history of infidelity ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/HGwCCNb.jpg)). [Maddox-Shaw et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2012.666816) affirmed that the number of prior sex partners predicted future extradyadic sexual activity, or sex with others while in a relationship, in unmarried heterosexual couples ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/VBq0su1.jpg)). [Hughes and Gallup (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1090-5138(02\)00149-6) found that promiscuity (measured in number of sexual partners) is a good predictor of infidelity in women, with promiscuity among females accounting for almost twice as much [variance](https://archive.ph/5Skz7) in infidelity (r^2 = .45) as it did for males (r^2 = .25) ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/2vklWn1.jpg)).

[Pinto and Arantes (2017)](https://doi.org/10.30958/ajss.4-4-3) found that sexual promiscuity doesn’t just have a high correlation with sexual infidelity (r = .595), but that it also has a high correlation with emotional infidelity (r = .676)([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/qEPttQz.jpg)). In their study of female twin pairs, [Cherkas et al. (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1375/twin.7.6.649) affirmed the high correlation between women’s promiscuity and infidelity but also discovered that the genetic correlation between the two traits was .47, so nearly half the genes impacting infidelity also affect number of sexual partners ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/0GNvYK0.jpg)). Summarizing the current state of research on the prediction of infidelity, [Fincham and May (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2016.03.008) listed a greater number of sexual partners in their list of demographic factors found to facilitate infidelity, writing that permissive attitudes toward sex, a greater willingness to have casual sex and to engage in sex without closeness, commitment or love (i.e., a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation) are also reliably related to infidelity ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/vCvZmQR.jpg)). [Bailey et al. (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.78.3.537) wrote that approximately half of women who scored in the top 20% of [sociosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociosexuality) reported having cheated on a steady partner, a ten-fold increase to women who scored on the bottom 20% ([excerpt](https://i.imgur.com/bEfXZLO.jpg)), though this is likely an underestimate as women tend to underreport their sexual indiscretions. 

Running values from the General Social Survey, [McQuivey (2019)](https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-road-to-infidelity-passes-through-multiple-sexual-partners) found that people who reported four or fewer lifetime sexual partners, the rate of infidelity in the current marriage dropped to 11%, while for those who had five or more sexual partners the number was nearly double (21%) ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/scosEXa.jpg)). Relationship consultant, author, PhD, licensed marriage and family therapist, [Dr. Athena Staik (2019)](https://archive.is/bPRPy) placed a “history of promiscuity” as number two in her list of “10 Predictors of Infidelity and Gender Differences” on [Psych Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych_Central) (popular news site for mental health professionals), writing:

> Contrary to the myth, partners who’ve had many partners have a harder, not easier, time remaining monogamous. They are significantly more at risk of straying than those with little or no prior sexual experience

[Taylor Kubota (2015)](https://archive.md/7wOAo) of Men’s Journal got into touch with sex researcher and adjunct professor of human sexuality at NYU [Zhana Vrangalova Ph.D.](https://archive.md/6mhGj) to learn the expert consensus for her article “What the Number of Sexual Partners Says About You”:

> According to many experts, it matters — and can say a fair amount about your sexual needs and even who you are. Here, with the help of sex researcher and adjunct professor of human sexuality at NYU Zhana Vrangalova, is an examination of what experts have found the number means for men and women… As it relates to sexual history later in life, promiscuity is linked to a higher likelihood of cheating in long-term, serious relationships. Vrangalova thinks the reason may be that many promiscuous people aren’t really built for monogamy.

181,Why Mate Guarding is a subconscious turn off,164,smtwki,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/smtwki/why_mate_guarding_is_a_subconscious_turn_off/,159,"Now, you will see here multiple reasons why mate guarding is a turn off for women (it shows neediness, lack of abundance etc etc). But I would like to discuss one research I found regarding Ejaculate quality. 

Basically this is the published research paper

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4176016/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4176016/)  


which you can read if you want to, but I think the abstract explains it best

"" In species where females mate with multiple males, the sperm from these males must compete to fertilise available ova. Sexual selection from sperm competition is expected to favor opposing adaptations in males that function either in the avoidance of sperm competition (by guarding females from rival males) or in the engagement in sperm competition (by increased expenditure on the ejaculate). The extent to which males may adjust the relative use of these opposing tactics has been relatively neglected. Where males can successfully avoid sperm competition from rivals, one might expect a decrease in their expenditure on tactics for the engagement in sperm competition and vice versa. In this study, we examine the relationship between mate guarding and ejaculate quality using humans as an empirical model. We found that men who performed fewer mate guarding behaviors produced higher quality ejaculates, having a greater concentration of sperm, a higher percentage of motile sperm and sperm that swam faster and less erratically. These effects were found independent of lifestyle factors or factors related to male quality. Our findings suggest that male expenditure on mate guarding and on the ejaculate may represent alternative routes to paternity assurance in humans. ""

So, males that do not partake in mate guarding, have better semen.   
Besides all the wheel spinning subconscious tactics, here's something engrained in our biology. And probably in women's biology too. Their primate brains already know this. Our primate brains already know this. 

  
To rephrase the above, here's proof that if you Mate Guard, you are seen as weak.",1644250467.0
182,Final phase of redpill in my opinion: You get to chill and don't give a fuck for good,541,slzhvn,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/slzhvn/final_phase_of_redpill_in_my_opinion_you_get_to/,78,"I think it's over 5 years since I learned about redpill.

In that period I was really depressed and angry at the world. Because I was poor, I tried to fit in, I was in love but she didn't love me back, and all that bullshit we've all been through.

I started going to the gym, I started working and making money, I was grinding everyday and I was reading as much of the redpill knowledge as I could. Over and over again. Sometimes I scored a hot chicked, sometimes I got rejected by an ugly chick. I tought I was on the top of the world once, with a beautiful girlfriend and a good job, had to leave a job I loved (you can find the story in my posts) and broke up soon after. Started to fill the void in me with work. Didn't go to gym anymore, started again, quit again. I've spent huge sums of money trying to look richer than I was, driving a camaro or a lexus, living in a rented penthouse, going to expensive clubs or restaurants, living the high life paycheck to paycheck even though I didn't want to admit I had a problem. Got to the best physical shape of my life then to the worst. Was rich and poor. Was excited about life and depressed.

What can I say, it was a journey full of ups and downs in every area of my life. At one point I was living under the motto ""self improvement is masturbation, now self destruction..."" (you know what I mean) and even though I thought I was feeling good, I wasn't, trust me.

But why was that?

Well, although when I was younger I didn't want to admit, everything I did, I did to impress others. I wanted to live a dream life not for me, but to impress others. I didn't do the things that I wanted, but the things that I thought will bring me the biggest prestige in front of others and will create in their head the image I wanted.

Even though I was able to pull girls and one night stands I wanted a stable hot girlfriend because that is something that society views as a sign of success, and this lead me to big mistakes during my journey. Whenever I found a potential girl to feel that role, even though no longer was I capable of that blind love you see in movies, I wanted someone to fill the role of the trophy girlfriend in my life if you could say that, and I made noobie mistakes in the redpill game, just because I didn't want to mess the opportunity to create that perfect image of myself in front of society. Oh how dumb I was.

Even though I was making a lot of money considering the country I live in, I was simply burning through them to sustain a lifestyle that was too expensive. Didn't went in any big debts, but didn't save either. Probably this is my greatest regret, because with those money that I threw away on partying, with some good investing choices, I could have been pretty good by now.

But thanks God I had a revelation. I was at a party, and I realised I wasn't actually having fun, I was just seeing it as time wasted, I didn't enjoyed most of the company and I realised that I don't really enjoy that kind of fun. Drinking overpriced alcohol in industrial quantities was not my kind of fun anymore. Having a coffee with a good friend while discussing a business idea or talking about life in general brought me more joy than meaningless expensive party. Especially since I realised the highlights of that party were pretty much the moments I would post a story on instagram to show off my life style then checking the people who saw the story from time to time, just to get joy from seeing someone who did bad to me in the past seeing how well I'm doing now. That's what I thought. It was bullshit. Nobody gives a fuck about you. Maybe for a second they will throw a curse word in your direction but that's it.

&#x200B;

I'm no longer doing stuff like that. I no longer want to impress people. I've realised life is too short to do things you don't enjoy 100%.

&#x200B;

I no longer go to gym to become buffed up to impress chicks. I go for my health (and having this in mind I'm actually more motivated to go, because when the only reason you are hitting the gym is to increase your SMV, then on the first rejection your motivation will drop).

 I no longer pay a big rent for a penthouse, I bought a nice apartment with everything I need instead ( which actually looks a lot nicer since I furnished it as I pleased and take less of my time to keep nice and clean). 

I no longer have the lexus, which I bought just because (in my mind) it showed I'm a serious successful young man. I sold it, most of the money I used for a good investment (won't go into details, but it will return x3 in two years, it was a hell of a good tip), and what was left I used to buy a used car (but still quiet nice) that I drive to work everyday. I still have a passion for cars and I plan to buy a car for my joy without giving a fuck about the brand prestige (when I consider that I have some money to put into that because right now I'm focusing on saving up and investing).

I no longer wear my expensive wardrobe and take over an hour to decide what to wear and prepare in the morning. I dress to feel good with what comes in handy at the moment. That's it.

I no longer wear my rolex everyday and I said I wouldn't wear it daily until I could buy one with 25% of my monthly income..

I no longer spend a lot of times on dating apps going out with chicks that think they are better than they are just because there are 1000 guys asking them out. Instead, if I see a cute girl at my coffee place, I start talking to her and ask for her number, or at the library, or wherever the fuck I am, if I wish so. You would be surprised how natural a conversation can come in real life when you haven't been vetted online before, and I enjoy this a lot more. 

I'm no longer a try hard, and I'm the happiest I've ever been. I spend my money wisely, I go to dates from time to time, pull a girl now and then when I'm into the mood to fuck something. I reduced my circle of friends to the ones I truly enjoy spending time with. I no longer go to any social event just to show off on the internet. Actually, I'm no longer so active on the social media at all. I just don't give a fuck. My main goal is no longer impressing others, but retiring early and living a peaceful live.

That should be the end goal of redpill, retiring early, living a peaceful life and doing the things you truly love, not the things that everybody wishes to do so you can show off that you live the life they wished. Just my two cent.

The earlier you realise this the better you will be. Partying and fucking one new girl everynight is not the goal. Your happiness is, if that means your happiness, go for it, if not, don't follow the social norm of happiness.

As I said, right now I'm happy, sipping from a bottle of wine that I didn't post on instagram, writing a post on redpill before I return to writing on my book, listening to some music, after I spent some quality time with my family who I've neglected in the last years. Tomorrow I'll be ready to go to my office which I love, working at something that I like in a fun environment, then maybe I'll hit a gym, or go for a coffee, or read a book. 

Life's good and I don't give a fuck about what other think.

So to sum it up:

1. Don't give a fuck about what people think and don't try to impress others.
2. Don't spend most of your time and energy on trying to fuck as many girls as possible. Don't make a woman your goal. They are just there, a passing entertainment for young men.
3. Gym and exercising should be about you and your health, not about creating an image of you that will impress others.
4. And as always: I've been a poor man, and I've been a rich man, and I choose rich everytime. Work on your career and spend your money wisely.

Cheers brothers and keep on going!",1644161793.0
183,The Moment of Panic is the Moment of Opportunity,142,sm5mmc,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/sm5mmc/the_moment_of_panic_is_the_moment_of_opportunity/,41,"**The Moment of Panic**


The Moment of Panic arrives when you get fired/laid off.  Or when your LTR dumps you and walks out the door with 100% of your pussy supply.  The Moment of Panic is when you *think* you're fucked.

Except you’re not fucked.  Read on, younglings.

**The Moment of Panic is really the Moment of Opportunity.**

The Moment of Panic is really your chance to re-invent yourself.  Years ago, I was 5 years into my first *REAL* job in CorporateLand.  I had outgrown the position, the company and the city I was living it.  We were getting acquired by another, larger firm, and usually that means a 20% workforce reduction, because those “synergies” and “savings” have to come from somewhere.  

So I volunteered to get cut, as part of the RIF (Reduction in Force, for you n00bs, it’s Corporate Speak for getting laid off).  

Why?  Well first, based on time in grade, and also because they offered an “additional severance” for people who they didn’t want to leave before sale and thus decrease the value of the company (which thankfully included me), I would be getting nearly 2 years of salary if I was there on the last day.  

So I volunteered, even though you weren’t actually *permitted* to volunteer.  I did anyway.  I offered to flip the lights off on the last day.  Why?  In addition to the money, I did not have a wife or kids or a mortgage, my lease was month-to-month, and I knew I could simply go re-invent myself somewhere else.  

Somewhere *better*.  

And that’s what I did. 

As you progress as a man, you will outgrow jobs, and you will outgrow relationships.  We have a tendency to stay in comfortable situations.  I am a bit guilty of that myself, in my current gig, but I also re-shaped it in ways that would not usually be permitted, but, well, I’m *special*.  Until I’m not.  And that time is arriving.  


**The Importance of Optionality.**

The difference between me and you, younglings, for now, is that I don’t panic.  Someday, you will not either, provided that you play your cards right.  This is why we tell you to get on your grind and stay on your grind.  This is why you should develop multiple streams of income and then thicken the streams.  

A man who has options is a man who cannot be fucked with.

*“Everybody go: Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn*
*You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend.”*

-“Rapper’s Delight” by the Sugar Hill Gang.


It’s also why I am a fan of dating/plating multiple women, so no *ONE* woman is going to decide if you’re going to fuck tonight.  If a girl leaves, she’s not walking out the door with 100% of your pussy supply, and that gives you optionality, and therefore clarity, all the time.  It makes YOU the “chooser.”  It keeps the Balance of Power shifted in your favor. 

At the end of the day, the more options you have in life, and with girls, the less you can be fucked with.  You won’t have to put up with your boss’ shit if you can cross the street and get another job for the same or better pay.  You won’t have to put up with one girl’s awful nagging if you can go find another girl who sucks dick as good (or is willing to learn) and who isn’t a complete pain in the ass.  

Lack of Abundance or at least scarcity mentality, is a great way to make yourself crazy, and desperation for pussy Turns.Women.Off.  No pussy beggar ever pussy-begged his way out of a dry spell.  It's miserable, and, in it's most extreme form is how guys wind up as the back half of a murder-suicide.  So [Build yourself into the Prize](https://archive.is/ZM7zX) and work on that Abundance Mentality.

So when things get asymmetric, don’t panic, slow down, take stock of where you are and plan your path forward to a better future.  


**Takeaways:**

-Don’t panic.

-Change is an opportunity to reinvent yourself.

-Develop multiple streams of income and then thicken the streams.

184,"Some Great Eye Opening Quotes From, ""The Manipulated Man."" A Book Which Was Written By A Woman.",316,sjujdp,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/sjujdp/some_great_eye_opening_quotes_from_the/,71,"Tl;dr: If you don't have the time to read all the quotes now, save this post and read it later. 


Note that the book ""The Manipulated Man"" was written in 1971 by a german woman. 


 The knowledge and info was always out there, but society and people (mainstream) have been  brainwashed and manipulated to such an extent that, they would never acknowledge the truth written in this book. I think it's a must-read for every man as it'll lead to a lot of eureka moments and break the shackles that you're chained in due to indoctrination by people who were fooled themselves. 



One of the biggest issues is, that humans' ego has become so overinflated during the last couple of centuries that they deny any kind of evidence that does not fit in their world view. They do not understand themselves. Why would they? There's no need, living a comfortable live with no evolutionary pressure to think outside the box. They talk the talk, but don't walk the walk. You've probably seen it hundreds of times: People say one thing, and do another. (Actions >>>> Words) That's especially the case for women who pretend to know exactly what they want. Truth is, they don't. Even on Reddit, it's all just hypocritical nonsense, virtue signalling everywhere. They'll call you names, bully you, check your post history and cherry pick some comment of yours to justify their apparent superiority simply because you believe in something else. 



We've got facts, books, studies, life experience etc to provide proof for our point of view, they don't. Aside from that, it's not even our job to convince someone to change. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. Whatever they may say - it doesn't matter because we reap the benefits from facing the truth while they'll end up hurting themselves a dozen times first before realizing that we're right. **Anyways, quotes start from here. Enjoy.**





 ""It is quite incredible that men, whose desire for knowledge is unbounded in every other field, are really totally blind to these facts, that they are incapable of seeing women as they really are: with nothing else to offer but a vagina, two breasts, and some punch cards programmed with idle, stereotyped chatter; that they are nothing more than conglomerations of matter, lumps of stuffed human skin pretending to be thinking human beings."" ​





 ""If only man would stop for one moment in his heedless rush toward progress and think about this state of affairs, he would inevitably realize that his efforts to give woman a sense of mental stimulation have been totally in vain. It is true that woman gets progressively more elegant, more well-groomed, more “cultured,” but her demands on life will always be material, never intellectual."" ​ 





""Men seem incapable of realizing that women entirely lack ambition, desire for knowledge, and need to prove themselves, all things which, to him, are a matter of course. They allow men to live in a world apart because they do not want to join them. Why should they? The sort of independence men have means nothing to women, because women don't feel dependent. They are not even embarrassed by the intellectual superiority of men because they have no ambition in that direction.""





 ​ ""She takes care that man is directly trained for a particular purpose: he must work and put the fruits of his labor at her disposal. Woman has had this aim in her view throughout the upbringing of her child, and she engenders in him a series of conditioned reflexes which cause him to produce everything to satisfy her material needs. She does this by manipulating him from his first year of life. Consequently, by the time his education is complete, man will judge his own value to be woman's estimation of his usefulness. He will be happy only when he has won her praise and produced something of value to her. One might well say that woman becomes a kind of value scale. At a given moment, a man can refer back to it and judge the value or futility of his actions. If he spends any time on something which has no value in terms of this chart, football, for example, he will do his best to compensate quickly for this minus point by increasing his activity on the plus side of the scale – which explains why women do not object too strongly to football or other types of spectator sports""





 ​ Yet man is only a tiny cog in a gigantic business machine, he himself being in effect exploited at every turn. When he drives others, he drives himself most of all. His orders are really orders from above, passed on by him. If the men at the top occasionally take time to praise him, it is not in order to make him happy – it is only to spur him on, to stimulate him to greater effort. For man, who was brought up to be proud and honorable, every working day is merely an endless series of humiliations. He shows enthusiasm for products he finds useless, he laughs at jokes he finds tasteless, he expresses opinions which are not his own. Not for a moment is he allowed to forget that the merest oversight may mean demotion, that one slip of the tongue may spell the end of his career. ​ 


""Women, on the other hand, need children to justify their laziness, stupidity, and lack of responsibility. Both sexes exploit the child, therefore, for their own ends. Although the whole world is full of half-starved orphans, every couple produces its own brood. Man must have a reason to be enslaved when, later on, his sexual powers have declined, and this reason must also explain his enslavement to a particular woman. This is simple. She is, after all, the mother of his children. Since woman is the excuse for his subjugation, he can have only one at a time (in every industrial society, man is monotheistic – i.e., monogamous); more than one god (woman) would make him insecure, lead him to question his own identity, and throw him back into the state of freedom he is constantly trying to escape. Questions such as this do not interest woman. As she does not think abstractly, the problems of existential anxiety do not touch her. She has no need for a deity to give meaning to her life. All she needs is an excuse for making one particular man work for her long after he ceases to want to go to bed with her.""






 ​ ""This may suggest that women decide in favor of a home and family simply because they love children. But women are not capable of the unconditional love a child should have. This can easily be proved. Women only care for their own children, never those of others. A woman will accept a child who is not her flesh and blood only when she is physically incapable of having her own (and this only after everything has been tried – including artificial insemination by an unknown donor). Although orphanages throughout the world are full of appealing, needy children, and although the newspapers and TV report daily on the number of little Africans, Indians, or South Americans who are starving to death, a woman would rather give a stray dog or cat a home than a deserted child. And yet she pretends to love children.""





 ​ ""Once a human being is free, if it happens to be rather stupid (and women are stupid) it will be quite happy with its freedom and try to retain it. As the unintelligent human being is incapable of abstract thought, it will never feel the need to leave its familiar terrain and consequently will never fear that its very existence might be threatened. It is not afraid of death because it cannot imagine it. There is no need to find a meaning or reason for life: its desires are fulfilled in its own personal comforts, and these provide reason enough for living. Even the need for religion is comparatively unknown to a person of low intelligence and, if it does arise, it is very easily satisfied. A stupid person has an infinite capacity for self-adoration. If a woman chooses to believe in God, it is for one reason only: she wants to go to heaven. And what, after all, is the dear Lord but yet another man who will arrange things for her? The situation of the intelligent person, i.e., a man, is very different. At first he welcomes his newfound freedom with a sense of relief, drunk with the vision and perspective of life before him. But the moment he puts this freedom to the test, that is, as soon as he wants to commit a given act which might send him in a given direction, he gets scared: since he is capable of abstract thought, he knows that each of his acts has a series of possible consequences, not all of which can be predicted. If he decides to act of his own free will, the responsibility will be his alone."" ​ 







""No, one can hardly assume men do all this for pleasure and without feeling a desire for change. They do it because they have been manipulated into doing it: their whole life is nothing but a series of conditioned reflexes, a series of animal acts. A man who is no longer able to perform these acts, whose earning capacity is lessened, is considered a failure. He stands to lose everything – wife, family, home, his whole purpose in life – all things in fact which give him security. Of course one might say that a man who has lost his capacity for earning money is automatically freed from his burden and should be glad about this happy ending – but freedom is the last thing he wants. He functions, as we shall see, according to the principle of pleasure in non-freedom. To be sentenced to life-long freedom is a worse fate than life-long slavery."" ​ 






""Women live an animal existence. They like eating, drinking, sleeping – even sex, providing there is nothing to do and no real effort is required of them. Unlike a man, a woman will rarely make an effort to get her partner into bed. If, however, he is already there, and she hasn't planned to set her hair or undertake some other form of large-scale beauty repair, and there is no TV program she wants to see, she will not be averse to making love, provided he is prepared to be the active partner. But even the euphemisms “active” for the male partner and “passive” for the female do not conceal the fact that woman allows man to serve her in bed just as he does in every other sphere of her life. Even though intercourse may give a man pleasure in the long run, it is nothing more than a service to a woman, in which the man is the better lover, arousing desire more skillfully, quickly, and making it last longer.""





 ​ ""An only child affords no benefits, only disadvantages. The woman never seems as unprotected and tied to her home as she should be. Apart from that, something might happen to the child, possibly when the mother is past child-bearing age. Then she would have no excuse left for having things made comfortable for her, and her husband would have no reason to go on working for her alone. Also, an only child has no playmate, and the mother would have to play with him; if there is anything a woman loathes, it is having to play with children. Children are curious about absolutely everything, but a woman has no interests at all except the few idiotic forms of entertainment offered by her house and her own body. With the best will in the world, it is difficult for a mother to enter into the adventurous world of a child. She may have a small repertoire of insipid stock phrases to amuse a toddler (“look who's coming now”), but by the age of two a child has started to think for himself and woman is left behind. The cliché about the common interests of father and son (father cannot stop playing with his son's model railway) cannot be applied to mother and son, or even to mother and daughter. If a woman makes an effort and spends half an hour playing with her child (more might stunt its mental development), she tells the whole world, as if it were a great achievement, which of course it is, in terms of self-denial."" ​ 




""Several children, on the other hand, can be trained by emotional blackmail. As they are all dependent on their mother's approval, she has only to show a slight preference for one and the others will do anything she tells them to. Every child lives in constant fear that its mother will “withdraw” her love and give it to someone else. And if this fear does not create affection between siblings (as if woman would care!), it at least increases their competitiveness and performance. Even later, when the children have long since grown up, they will still vie with each other for their mother's respect. The sons satisfy their ambitions in their work, the daughters in the amassing of property."" ​




 ""A man could, of course, condition his sexual needs as easily as a woman, provided his training started at a very early age. Sufficient proof of this are the monks, the majority of whom survive without sexual satisfaction (nobody will seriously maintain that they are all eunuchs). But instead of learning to suppress his needs, a man will allow them to be encouraged whenever possible – by women, of course, since their interests are mainly directed toward man's libido."" ​




 ""A woman does not want to stay at home just to rest (what has she, after all, to rest from?) – but she is addicted to pleasure, and she needs time for her pleasures. And what are they? Baking cakes, ironing the laundry, making clothes, cleaning windows, curling her hair, painting her toenails, and sometimes even – and we will come to this later – doing a little shorthand and typing. And just to make sure that no one recognizes the fact that for her all this is pleasure, she calls these pleasures “housework.” She is only indulging in orgies of “personal hygiene” to please her partner. And if one of her silly little pleasures is to sit at a desk in an outer office, translating ready-made thoughts (ready-made since they are provided by professional men) into a visual medium, well, let her call it “stimulating mental work.”""




 ​ ""Not even psychologists can grasp it, although they spend their lives studying the female mind. Being men, they must find it more interesting than their own. But it would never occur to them for a minute that woman's so-called psyche is unfathomable merely because of the absence of intelligence; that feminine work appears unattractive to the male only because he is incapable of imagining the required degree of stupidity necessary to be able to enjoy it."" ​ 




""Most men will never admit the depth of their wives' stupidity. They agree that women are not terribly clever, but grant them “intuition” or instinct instead. And they like to call this a feminine instinct as opposed to that of an animal. Unfortunately, this famous feminine instinct is really nothing but a euphemism for statistical probability. Women interfere and give opinions about everything, and, since they are so stupid, they don't realize that they are making fools of themselves. According to the law of averages, their forecasts will be correct now and again. In any case, most of their predictions are negative or vague. Banalities such as: “It can only end in disaster,” or “I'd steer clear of that, if I were you,” or “Your so-called friends will only let you down in the end” are meaningless. Anyone would be safe making such generalizations. And if, occasionally, women do see more clearly than men, it is only because their feelings, unlike those of men, are never involved.""






 ​ ""Women’s stupidity is so overwhelming that anyone who comes into contact with it will become, in a way, infected by it. That this is not obvious is solely because everybody has been exposed to it from birth and, as a result, has become inured to it. In previous years men either ignored it or believed it to be a typically feminine characteristic which harmed no one. But with the increase in leisure and money to spend, woman's need for entertainment has grown. Consequently, her imbecility is spreading into public life as well, reflected not just in vases, bedroom pictures, brocade curtains, cocktail parties, and Sunday sermons. The mass media have become more involved in it. Women's programs are gaining ground in radio and television. And even respectable newspapers print society gossip, crime features, and fashion news, horoscopes, and cooking recipes. And women's magazines become every day more numerous and sumptuous on the stands. Step by step, not only the private sphere of men but all of public life has become infected by this stupidity."" ​

185,Honest Openers Are The Best Openers--What To Say When You Approach Women,170,sj679s,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/sj679s/honest_openers_are_the_best_openerswhat_to_say/,21,"I've learned that the best openers are the most simple and honest openers.  I like using situational lines or just telling women  why I approached them.  If you try to get too creative, you may fumble over your words or come off like you're trying to hard.

A major problem is men think too much when they talk to women.  Being stuck in your head doesn't allow your game to flow freely.  This is why men like going to the bar to talk to women.  They can be honest and flow freely with their words and blame it on the alcohol.  Doing it sober is a bit of a challenge.

Let's say you're at a department store buying a shirt.  You see a cute customer across from you.  As you look over to her you can say,

""You like?"", as you hold the shirt up to your chest.

This is a good situational opener because it's relevant to what's happening.  You don't have to think too hard and it's just two clever words.

If you see an attractive woman sitting around doing nothing and you have no good reason for being in front of her but only to talk to her, I would go tell her why I approached her.

Let's say a woman was wearing a sexy long, form-fitting dress.  You thought she looked hot and you wanted to talk to her.

""I was just passing by and I just wanted to say you look good in that dress.  It looks very sexy, but classy.  What's your name?""

I already know what some of you are gonna say,

""You sound like you're thirsty"" or ""That's harassment""

Don't confuse compliments and showing interest with thirst.  The only way it would be considered harassment is if she tells you she's not interested and you keep bothering her.

I would stay away from trying to say something cool and just keep it simple.  A well-timed line in the right situation will make you  sound effortlessly cool.

I don't suggest you say this on the job, but this is one of my favorite scenes on the movie, The Ugly Truth (Clip: [https://youtu.be/cyJaaTgj-ro](https://youtu.be/cyJaaTgj-ro))

""You can't say that!  That's a fucking movie!""

It's not about what he said, but how quick he was on his feet when he told her that.  When you start to become bold, solid, and confident with women, if you say something like that to a woman, it may have her giggling.

**Good Practice:** Before you go up and talk to a woman, what is she doing?  What is she wearing?  What's happening around her?  This allows you to use the situation as an opener.  If you see her and just want to go for it, what made you want to talk to her?  Was it her legs?  Her round butt?  Her pretty face?  Just tell her what made you approach her.  You'll be surprised at how much of a positive response you'll get the better you get.

I haven't written anything that has scandalized the bluepills in a bit, so here goes.  This is actually a tangent from another post I am currently writing about men and the ""Burden of Performance.""  Enjoy.

There are 15 good years to be a woman.  From about 16 when guys start to notice her, to about 30, when she hears the Conductor bellow: *“WALL^SPLAT! STATION!!! EVERYBODY OFF!!!”*  

And then what? 

Well, women can still be attractive, post-Wall^SPLAT! but it’s not going to be like when they are 20.  Now, the *¡Feministas!* are going to point to exceptions, like Charlize Theron, who has definitely NOT seen her Last Fuckable Day, but is [“shockingly available”](https://archive.is/cuiL7). 

Except it’s not shocking at all.  Why?  Well, first, she’s post-Wall^SPLAT! And, at 46, she’s not going to give you kids.  She has a couple of adopted kids, including a boy she dresses as a girl because he told her he was a girl once when he was four.  A woman I know says, *“When my oldest son was 5 he told me he was a bird.  I didn’t glue feathers to him, feed him worms and make him sleep on a bed of twigs.”*  So yeah CT is wacko.

But her primary difficulty is she used to be an Apex Female.

Used to be.

She’s tall (5’10”), definitely a beauty, and she’s loaded from her modeling and acting career.  Women date across and up dominance hierarchies, so who is she going to want?  A man who would meet her standards can date…anybody.  And will likely be dating 2x23 year olds and not a single mom of 46.  It is how it is.  

This isn’t helping her: *""I feel like I'm in a place in my life where you gotta come with a lot of game. Not the kind of game that we think of, the kind of game that's like, my life is really good, so you better be able to bring that and maybe better, ‘cause I just won't accept anything less.""*

And let’s have a moment of silence for her prospects.

It could be worse.  She could be Sharon Stone.  The Femme Fatale of *“Basic Instinct”* - which includes a [leg-crossing scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoSxTkT80bo) that nearly forced Wayne Knight to stroke out during filming – [got kicked off of Bumble](https://archive.is/wIjob) because nobody believed that the real Sharon Stone would have to be on Bumble.  But that’s what happens to formerly hot women who fuck up their dating lives and wind up on the “Discard Pile of Life”.

If Charlize Theron and Sharon Stone can’t find a man, what hope is there for the “average” 50 year old broad?

Well not much if you ask Yann Moix:

*[“I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of. The body of a 25-year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of 50 is not extraordinary at all”](https://archive.is/EGQd7)*

-French Novelist Yann Moix, presumably right before the *¡Feministas!* came for him with torches and pitchforks.

He added that women his own age are “invisible” to him.  Moix is a year younger than me, and I understand what he means.  
How can Moix say such outrageous shit?  Well, Moix has written a dozen or so novels and directed 3 films.  His novels have won prizes.  He had taken the “Burden of Performance” to the top of the mountain.  Whomever he is fucking I’m sure she (or they) are hot and young.

Incidentally, some women are more realistic about this: *[“And before we as women absolve ourselves from the older man-younger woman paradigm, let's not forget that for every older guy there’s a younger woman who will be happy to date them.”](https://archive.is/2dVVU)* – Marguerite Kelly

Neither Moix or Kelly are lying: [Men of any age prefer women in their early 20s](https://archive.is/1cXCv).  I certainly do.  Younger women have, on average, better bodies, they generally have youthful energy, they believe everything you tell them, they don’t bitch and they are never ‘too tired’ for fun.  What’s not to like?

I suppose the older ladies can take solace in Feminism, which was invented as a cope for post-Wall^SPLAT! – it’s a trade union for ugly women.  They would be better advised to lock down a good guy when they are at peak-beauty, but many of them tarry too long.

**The Paradox of the Wall^SPLAT!**

The odd (to us) thing is, when women approach the Wall^SPLAT! they will often complain that *""THERE ARE NO GOOD MEN LEFT!""*  

That's simply not true.

The problem they have is that *""There are no good men left to me, given my decreasing SMV and my increasing demands.""*  Their demands go up because, unlike a woman at 22, a woman at 32 cannot afford to make a mistake.  Her SMV is decreasing by the minute and she needs to [leave the casino](https://archive.is/5cAL9) NOW.

Women approaching the Wall^SPLAT! *act* like they are ""Giffen Goods"" - low income, non-luxury goods with few ready substitutes, whose price *rises* as demand *increases*.  The difficulty for women in the Epiphany Phase is, they are not Giffen Goods, because there are ready substitutes (younger women) and those substitutes are higher quality (younger women have a more time left in their period of youth and fertility).

N.B.  Such women likely think they are Veblen Goods - high quality luxury goods whose price increases as demand increases because they are well-made, exclusive and ""high status"", such as yachts, designer jewelry, supercars, but that is too laughable to be useful as an example.  If that were the case, then they wouldn't be whining about the lack of demand for them among ""good men"", rather they would be drowning in attention from such men.  


**Women Are Born With Everything And Die With Nothing; Men Are Born With Nothing But Die With Everything.**

So where does that leave men?   

In the catbird seat.  If you spend your younger years wisely, staying on your grind, making yourself into the Prize^TM and building your empire.

*“Women are Human Beings; Men are Human Doings.”*

-Dr. Warren Farrell


“Men are here to DO shit. Women are here to make more men.” – Based Napoleon, only he said it in French. (Quote approximate.)


*“I’ll figure something out.”*

-Men, Everywhere.  


**Men Have Plans; Women Plan on Men Having a Plan.**

So I know a woman socially, who remarked to me (and others present) once at a cocktail party, that she enjoyed asking men what their plan was for a “Zombie Apocalypse”.  *“They all have one,”* she said, *“And they love telling you about it.”*

Everyone had a good chuckle, and then I said, *“You live in a state with natural disasters, right?  Earthquakes, wildfires, mudslides, that sort of thing?”*

Her: *“Yes.”*

Me: *“And I bet you expect your husband to ‘have a plan’, for you and the kids, if something like that happens where you live, right?”*

Her: *“Yes, of course.”*

Me: *“That plan is going to be a lot like his ‘Zombie Apocalypse’ Plan only with less shooting the shuffling dead in the head.”*

She became a bit more thoughtful after that.


**Women’s Value Is Intrinsic; Men’s Value Is Extrinsic**

Men DO; Women ARE.  What is a woman *expected* to do?  Be a CEO?  BAHAHAHAHAHA!  Maybe she CAN be, but what if she fails?  Well, just don’t do stupid, illegal shit and go to jail, like Elizabeth Holmes is going to.  Lizzie just preemptively had a kid because she’s going to be spending the majority of the rest of her kid-having years in prison.  She also dropped the Steve Jobs impersonation and the frog-like voice and talks more like a breathless young girl now.  

Ah, that’s it.  Women have kids.  Or don’t.  They are hot, or they are not.  And if they are hot *enough* they can simply [bail on their own life and set up shop in someone else’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxnWl-78poE).  It’s no mistake that attractive women often marry rich men.  And then what?  Squeeze out a couple of kids, maybe do some light housekeeping and cooking?  Good for her.  

I listened to an interview with one of the authors of a book titled ‘Smart Girls Marry Money’ or similar.  She is, IIRC, some sort of high-achieving double-ivy league grad.  She told of visiting her hometown and meeting up with their girlfriends, who are basically the “Real Housewives of Podunk”.  She expected them to be all impressed with her, and maybe they were, but they had all married men who could provide and so she related how they had lunch, with wine, and got hot stone massages and such, and she wound up thinking, *“Wait, I’m supposed to be the ‘smart one’.  These women have fun lives!”*

And if you are a man?  You had better have an education or a trade or learn how to be an entrepreneur or something, because your good looks aren’t going to bring the cashola in.  Men need to show up, get on their grind, say on their grind and make themselves INTO something.  That’s why we teach you about self-improvement.

Think about the last time you were on a team of guys.  Maybe a work team, maybe you were in the military, maybe you were on a sport team.  What matters?  Everything – race, age, whatever - drops out pretty quickly and it becomes about who brings what talent that they can contribute to the team.  Men, with regard to other men, don’t care about who they are, they care about skill and character.  They care if the other guys on the team can do their job, and if they can be counted, even under pressure.  This is why men razz each other, particularly younger guys.  To see how they handle adversity.  

Years ago, I would play basketball on a city court.  There was a thing where black guys (and it was mostly black guys) wouldn’t bother to guard the white guys until you showed you could play.  I saw this and positioned myself near the hoop, on the baseline, calling for the ball with my right hand, away from the traffic in the key.  Our point guard lobbed me the ball but it sailed waaaay over my head, and out of bounds.  As I turned to jog up court he hit his chest and said, *“Yo’, my bad.”*  I replied, *“What are you doing?  Shaving points?”*  He laughed as did some other guys.  He had accepted responsibility, and I had let him off the hook.   I had never met the guy before that day, but that’s the moment we became teammates.   


**“I’ll figure something out.”**

*“I’ll figure something out.”*  You’ve heard men say this – you may even have said it  yourself – after a setback.  You may not have any idea what you are going to do, just that you will “figure something out.”  This statement is the first step in fighting back against adversity – and other men will recognize this and respect it.  It is the first step of every comeback story.

[You need to learn to face adversity, and be resilient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNQhuFL6CWg).  If you get knocked down 7 times, you’d better get back up 8 times.  If you fail, nobody is going to feel sorry for you.  Society does not have empathy for men.  Succeed, and you can be a hero.  Fail, and you didn’t have the “Right Stuff.”  Fire is the test of steel, and adversity is the test of strong men.  The man on top of the mountain didn’t *FALL* there.  Yours is the Hard Road, the Difficult Road.  It will seem that all the world is against you.  But hard roads often lead to beautiful places. (Hat Tip: Zig Ziglar).

Don’t worry, younglings, you will get used to it.  And you will come to savor it.  I would much rather rely on myself than someone else.  I know me; they could be a fucking loser.  I’d rather bet on me.


**The Future Is(n’t) Female.**

No disrespect to the ladies here, but when Hillary Clinton announced, through that grinning rictus of a mouth, that “The Future is Female” I laughed out loud.  So long as the Burden of Performance is male, the future is male also.  Wherever there is a dirty, dangerous job to be done, there is a man doing it.  

The *¡Feministas!*, in using that language, have said the quiet part out loud.  To the *¡Feministas!*, Feminism isn’t F=M, it’s meant to be F>M.  They don’t understand power, other than in male terms. (Hat Tip: /u/Whisper)   They don’t know how to create it.  Thus they tell us that *“Men!  You have to give up some of your power, so we can be equal!”*  If we were really “equal” shouldn’t they know how to make their own power?  Of course, but they don’t.  So instead, they tell us *“We are Strong and Independent!  Now, men!  Solve all of our problems!”*  

The Patriarchy exists and will continue to exist, and its biggest allies will be feminine women.  Why?  Nobody loves themselves some Patriarchy as much as attractive feminine women.  Because women *benefit* from the Patriarchy more than anyone.   Why? Because the Sun of the Patriarchy shines on all.  In male hierarchies, everyone, high and low, has a place.  In female hierarchies, not so: the weapon of choice in female hierarchies is exclusion and ostracism.  In terms borrowed from H.G. Wells, they are the Eloi, and we are the Morlocks.

**Takeaways:**

-Take responsibility for yourself.

-Adversity will shape you and make you stronger, or it will break you.  

-Building your own strength is the path to self-reliance.

-That man on top of the mountain?  He didn’t fucking *FALL* there.

Having previously written **[Why ‘Assholes’ Get Laid, And You Don’t](https://archive.is/nso5T)** I will now expound on why you want to be the Asshole, and not the No Play Getting Nice Guy and/or White Knight.

Very often, a guy who is an “asshole” is simply someone who puts his own wants and desires first.  How so?  

That guy who won’t stay around and be Stacy’s emotional tampon?  


Asshole.


The guy who makes a move and drops girls who only want to waste his time?

Asshole.


The guy who gets on his grind, stays on his grind and doesn’t prioritize women?


Asshole.


The guy who doesn’t wait around in the FriendZone, doing the “Boyfriend Audition” waiting for Stacy to “realize” that they were “meant to be together”?


Asshole.


Who doesn’t immediately give up commitment to some bar slut who fucked him once?


Asshole.


Who strides up and vaporizes Joe Fedora’s “Nice Guy” game inside of 10 seconds?


Asshole.


**Why ‘Nice Guy’ Game Sucks**


You know who dissembles, and deflects and apologizes?  White Knights and Nice Guys.  Being a “Nice Guy” is an alternative pussy-getting strategy that doesn’t work.  Yet, for some reason, it seems to have a crack public relations team promoting it. (hat tip: Zoad).  

So why do guys’ do it?

Because it’s easy and safe.

Nice guy’s don’t have to fear rejection.  Nice guys don’t have to take risks.  Nice guys can keep the fantasy of their **[Disney Girl]( https://archive.is/xlVcS)** alive.  Nice Guys can stay in their comfy little soft-focus Purgatory, hoping that this year – *THIS YEAR!* – Will be the year that Stacy ‘gets it’ and finally puts that tenth “Nice Guy” stamp on his card and finally - *FINALLY!!* - gives him all the sex he deserves!

Yeah, that’s not how that works.  If it did, TRP would all about lifting so that you can carry her books and how to French braid her hair.  

Also, Nice Guy Game can get *DESTROYED* by an asshole in under 10 seconds.  How?

Asshole starts chatting up a hottie.  Joe Fedora the Nice Guy comes over do defend “his” woman.  He attempts to intervene, and the Asshole says, to the girl, *""Oh, is this your {air quotes} BOY-FRIEND?""* She giggles demurely, looks down and says 'no' and then the Asshole watches the Nice Guy’s testicles shrivel up into little hamster balls and then vanish in a puff of dust because all the 'work' he put in on 'his girl' just got vaporized.

Then the Asshole takes her back to his place and lays pipe, while the Nice Guy goes home and cries himself to sleep.  Because Nice Guys sleep alone.


**You Can Complain That Girls Dig Assholes, or You Can Be The Asshole Girls Dig.**


The right way to do it is to keep the vibe “mildly subversive.”  Tease her a bit.  You know how when you lean back on a stool’s back legs and you almost fall but you catch yourself?  You want her to feel that way all the time when she’s around you.  Like she’s not sure where she stands with you.

Teasing mean “light” teasing in fun.  Not this:

TRP: *“Girls like to be teased.”*

Sperg [to girl]:  *“YOU’RE A FAT MORON!”*

TRP: */facepalm*


Never go full asshole, unless you are in a “Total War” scenario.   Your goal is to be more like a sexist jerkboi.  If she says *“No guy has ever talked to me the way that you do!”* then you’re doing it right.

*GASP!!*  *“Uncle Vaz, did you say sexist!”*

Yes,  younglings, I did.  Why? Because women prefer sexist men.  [Even feminists](https://archive.is/F8Clb).

Do you ever see some Outlaw Biker crying in his beer about how his girlfriend left him for a “Nice Guy”?  Nope.  

The James Bond films, are, btw, a Master Class in [Amused Mastery]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpGFESbLMKU&t=16s), with a slightly asshole-y edge.  JB will def smack a ho.


When I get caught flat-footed on a question or shit-test, I go with whatever the most sexist thing I can think of:

*“Girls should be felt and not heard.”*  <= Always a favorite.


*“It’s lucky you’re so pretty.”*  <= Right after she does something dumb.


*“You clearly need ‘Adult Supervision’.”* <= Right after she makes a stupid suggestion.


*“You know that bratty girls get spanked, right?”*  <= plays into my hands.  Literally.


Why?  Because it WORKS. 
 

Her Brain:    :(

Her Pussy:   :))))))))


Besides, sometimes it’s just fun to **[Nuke the Hamster](https://archive.is/PXYP4)**.

Or to tell a girl that **[you only want her for sex](https://archive.is/P7S99)**.


**Possession of the Ass is 9/10th of the Law**


Her body – particularly her ass – belongs to you.  Why?  Well first it was literally developed for your pleasure.  That's why they have those long, lovely legs and those hourglass figures.  Because we dig it. 
 
But why her ass particularly?  Because he who controls the ass, controls the relationship.  Possession of the Ass is 9/10th of the Law.  Check out Tom Brady.  The G.O.A.T. knows what your Uncle Vaz knows.  Whenever he is on a red carpet with Gisele there is a lot of [Hand on Ass](https://archive.is/Jc0Ib) action.  Not just [one time](https://archive.is/emnfm), but [all the times](https://archive.is/Rn3w0).

If you want to hold the car door for her, fine…smack her on the butt while she’s getting inside.  


**Takeaways:**

•	Put yourself first.  

•	Take what you want, and pay for it.

•	Possession of the Ass is 9/10th of the Law.

•	Don’t’ complain that girls dig jerks, be the jerk that they did.

•	Nice Guys sleep alone.

*“One of the hardest things to do in life is to let go of people who aren’t ready to love you.”*


The above is often mis-attributed to Sir Anthony Hopkins, a 2x Oscar Winner for Best Actor, but not known as an essayist, but was actually penned by Brianna Wiest.  She wrote it as part of a sob-sister piece.  


I use it as a break-up line.  

It is sort of the grown-up version of my university break-up line, *“It’s not fair to me, it’s no fair to you and it’s not fair to the person who could really love you.”*  But there is some utility to it for you, younglings.  As you make your way through the world, 


So as you develop in your red-pill journey, and start improving and the quality of totty around you rises, you have to be careful about Chasing Stacy.  


*“But wait, Uncle Vaz,”* you say, *“Isn’t the point of all this self-improvement to GET Stacy?”*


No, and if you thought so, go punch yourself in the dick 10 times.  The point of self-improvement is so that you can live the life you want and not be some bloated, depressed, unhappy loser.  Often, a beneficial side-effect is, the quality of vagine you will be plunging rises.  The temptation is to go after *EVERY* Stacy, and that’s not feasible.  Your time and resources are finite.  Do not waste time on girls who are never going to fuck you, even if they *SEEM* like they might.


**The “Fuck, YEAH!” Girl.**


What you really want is the *“Fuck YEAH!”* girl.  The girl who is down for what you want, so if you say, *“Hey, let’s stay in tonight,”* her response will be *“Fuck, YEAH we are staying in.  Now sit back in that chair and unbuckle your belt so I can do something nice for you, Daddy.”*


That can be a Stacy, ofc, but won’t necessarily be.  But the *“Fuck YEAH!”* girl will be fucking *enthusiastic* and that’s better than a Stacy who isn’t there.  


What do I mean?  So in my rotation there are two Certified Stacies who are also “Fuck YEAH!”* girls.  Whatever idea I have is the Best Idea They Have Ever Heard.   I hear from them probably 5 days out of the week, and always them reaching out to me.  Another “Fuck YEAH” girl is on a program of sending me nudes every day, but she’s not quiet a Stacy.  Cute as a button, but not my type, but def fun to rail out.  


They all want my attention daily, check in regularly and never EVER leave me on read.  That’s the type you WANT.  


**Look Out For Number One**


As I said, your time and resources are limited.  Do not waste them on attention whores and validation addicts.  On the Discord the other day, one of the lads was asking for advice on how to move certain girls from text to IRL.  There are some girls who are just going to Waste Your Time.  You have to figure out when to continue to fish and when to cut bait, and if progress is not being made, you need to know when to move on.  


He continued that that he understood, but the “problem” is that the girls who run a bit hot and cold on him are hotter girls.  


That’s the difficulty.  Hot girls on apps are going to have MEGA options and if they’re not into you, but want to keep you around as “back-up” or for (online only) validation, then that doesn’t do you any good and in fact wastes your time, time you could be spending on your grind, or having fun or fucking other girls.  


There’s a girl I just cut loose who I have known for a bit, communicates with me regularly-ish, and such, but has a career that involves a lot of travel, so, as enthusiastic as she is (or *seems*) it’s difficult as fuck to get her to commit to plans.  


Ofc, she’s Hot As Fuck (her career?  Bikini and Fitness Model), and yeah, sometimes she’s going to be off in the Maldives or Mauritius on a shoot while I’m in NYC or SoCal.  But she’s always upfront with me.


Until she wasn’t.  


Two things happened recently that made me cut her loose.  First, she deceived me about her whereabouts one week – she was on a ski vacation on France – and then got non-committal about the week between Christmas and New Year because she “might visit her family” that week, which ofc she didn’t, but we didn’t hook up that week either.  She didn’t actually overtly lie about France, but she made sure not to tell me.  


So that led me to calling her and saying, *“Holly?  It’s Vaz.  So one of the hardest things to do in life is….”*  


I’m 100% sure she’s not heartbroken, nor am I.  I could have been number 2 on her list or number 22.  It doesn’t matter.  What matters is, I wasn’t Number One.  So I could keep wasting time on her, or I could cut her loose, and I chose to lighten my load. Good news for the guys below me is that they all moved up a notch.  Bad news?  They aren’t Number 1 either.


Deemphasize people who do not respect your time, or who just aren’t that into you.  


So how to get a girl off of an app and into your bed?


Look, three things can happen and two of them are bad.


A.	You get ghosted.


B.	You continue to trade messages, but nothing happens.


C.	You meet her IRL.



To get her to C, I would recommend Wr1tten’s patented line: *“Nobody fell in love over text.”*  I would add that the *“But I want to get to KNOW you first!”* move she might make is bullshit.  It’s 1000x easier and better to get to know someone by meeting them rather than exchanging novels over text.  If she won’t meet you, she wants to keep you interested but will ALWAYS be trying to find someone to upgrade to.  You don’t need that kind of drama in your life.  Exchange a few messages and then move her into real life.  If she isn’t down, then move her to the trash bin.


**Takeaways:**

- YOUR time is valuable.  Do not waste it on girls who only want attention.  They need to be cut from the team.

- If you aren’t *Numero Uno*, then it doesn’t matter what you are.  

- If she’s not ready to meet you IRL after a few messages, it’s time to move on.

- Isolate, escalate, penetrate. Cant’ do that over text.

His Mode One philosophy is all about being ""upfront and straightforward"" with women.  Keep in mind that, just like the Red Pill, Mode One is not for every man.  Hell, direct game itself is not for every man.  Being that you're upfront with women, you are gonna get a lot of women reject you because they know what you're about.  I say that not as a negative, but as a positive.

*Let's say I approach a woman in a bold, solid, and confident manner.  I let her know that I am interested in a casual sex relationship with her.  She rejects me and tells me she's more of a relationship girl.  I give a soft rebuttal of, ""yeah, but good dick is hard to find"" and give her my number just in case she changes her mind.  I got rejected, but she may have a ""moment of horniness"" in between relationships.  She gives me a call and jogs my memory on how she has my number.  I set a date for us to hook up and I get the pussy.  Let's say she enjoys the dick.  She enjoys my time with her and I enjoy fucking her.*

Being indirect or lying to women about your intent can fuck up your relationships with women just because you want a higher success rate with women.

*Let's say I approach the same woman and lie to her that I am also a relationship guy.  I wine and dine her, I take her out on dates, and one day I get the ass.  After I get the ass, I dump her because all I wanted to do was fuck and not be in a relationship.  She hates my guts and takes it out on every other man she gets with.*

Do you realize that most men struggle with women because there was another man you've never met, never even knew existed who fucked this woman over.  Then she gets with you and takes it out on you.  When you use direct game, you are letting women know what you're about and she can either take you or leave you, but there is no hard feelings.  The ones who get angry is because they have their own issues with duplicity.

The way I look at cold approaching is sharpening my skills to be bold, solid, and more confident with my game and find women who like me.

That last part is important because a lot of men are trying to get every woman in front of them to like them to increase their lay count with less approaches.  I'm a little different.  I would rather approach 100 women to find one woman who has genuine desire for me vs. try and get a woman to like me by bending to her standards.

My mentality is if she rejects me, it's practice to make my game stronger.  If she genuinely likes me, part of it was due to my game being stronger with all the practice from those other approaches.  So if I approach 100 women and 99 women reject me, woman #100 will get the better version because I had so much practice talking to women.  Yeah rejection sucks, but it's better to find a woman who likes you than trying to get women to like you by trying to impress her or be someone you're not.

The average man hates rejection, but if you treat it like practice for your game, you will notice that your success rate with women will increase each passing year.

191,The Marriage Manifesto: How To Keep The Power In LTRs and Marriage,313,seys6x,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/seys6x/the_marriage_manifesto_how_to_keep_the_power_in/,109,"Good afternoon RP. Alright, so today we are going to cover a controversial topic and that is LTRs and marriages. I know a lot of dudes on here are adamantly against these types of relationships, but the reality is a lot of dudes on here want to be loved and cherished by a woman. It is simply a relevant topic that should be open for discussion in the manosphere because men as a whole still have a desire to have a family, and as a man who is married and has a family, it is incredibly fulfilling. I want the same things for you if you want them.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to have a wife and kids, and IT IS something you can attain and keep. Understand though that today’s culture makes it a lot more difficult than it used to be. So I will recommend to anybody reading this, DO THE WORK FIRST. Take 6-7 years of practicing and self-improvement to get to a place where you can read women’s attraction levels like it is second nature and be good at plating and having abundance.

LTRs ARE RP ON HARD MODE - Do not try and do LTRs if you’re new to RP. Period. You will set your progress back years by doing so. You will get run over. You will run head first into shit tests that are beyond your level of experience. You will get dumped and you will get mad at yourself for not understanding what happened even though you’ve read the content. If you’re new to this, anything under 6 years of game, focus on plating and dating and upping your lay count. Many men get into LTRs without ever fucking more than 4-5 chicks and they’re forever slaves to the one pussy they have in their lives. It is imperative that you have lots wild sex with women before you settle down with one. If you’ve never had that, you have no business dating long term or being married.

CHOOSING - Having a choice is absolutely essential to finding a woman you are compatible enough with to have attraction that doesn’t die out. Any chick you decide to get into a LTR with should be a plate who is head and shoulders above the rest and consistently in your life for a very long time. They should take good care of you, know your likes and dislikes, and be able to read you without you having to say anything.

They should say they want to be exclusive with you and still be fine when you say you aren’t interested. And they should be okay knowing you’re fucking other women (don’t rub it in their face though). And most importantly, she should embody EXACTLY what you want in a woman. Again, head and shoulders above the rest to the point where she gives you NO REASON NOT TO BE EXCLUSIVE WITH HER. She outfucks all your other plates, you have a better time with her, she’s the hottest, she spoils you more than they do, etc. It needs to be a woman like that that you consider becoming exclusive with. To find a woman like that, you have to be really fucking good with women and that takes years of practice and internalizing all of this stuff.

POWER – The difference between spinning plates and exclusivity is your level of exposure. Spinning plates gives us the advantage because it gives us choice. Plate starts acting up and no longer fun to be around? Cool, 6 other chicks I am talking to would love to take her place.  When becoming exclusive, THAT DYNAMIC DOES NOT CHANGE. Women don’t mind sharing alpha dudes, and whether you’ve been exclusive with a chick for 3 days or 10 years, that reality should never change in the context of your relationship.

Women want men that other women want to fuck. You should always be a man other women want to fuck, especially when in an LTR or a marriage. A lot of men get divorced because they stop taking care of themselves and sacrifice their manhood as the stakes of the relationship (having kids, being married a long time, etc.) increase. Understand, WOMEN DO NOT WANT TO BE MARRIED TO PUSSIES. Period. They fucking hate it and they hate the weak men they are married to.

YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO KEEP BECOMING MORE ATTRACTIVE AS THE RELATIONSHIP PROGRESSES OVER THE YEARS. YOU SHOULD BE EVEN MORE CONFIDENT, DOMINANT, AND PHYSICALLY FIT 8 YEARS INTO THE MARRIAGE THEN YOU WERE WHEN YOU FIRST HOOKED UP WITH YOUR GIRL. You should be going out with your friends a few nights a week and leaving her wondering what you’re up to. You should still be talking to women and gauging their attraction levels. If you’re smart, you’ll marry a bi chick who is down to have threesomes and you bring other women home to play with. Which leads into the next section…

PUNISHMENT – Understand, LTRs and especially marriage is Red Pill on Hard Mode. With kids, it’s even crazier. With that, it is insanely rewarding to be loved by my wife and kids. I wouldn’t trade 1000 plates for the experience of raising my 5 kids. But I only get to enjoy it because I am a fucking maniac. My wife gives me no ground to be a pussy. Which means that I am an absolute savage with her and she loves me for it. The idea of PUNISHMENT in terms of an LTR is interesting. Because as you get more and more comfortable together, you find these insane boundary pushing levels of power spark as a result of the tests you run into.

Women want you to put them in their place, period. And they will push further and further if you don’t keep them in check with some hard ass finality. Do not ever, EVER let a chick take your balls from you, or there will be more hell to pay. That means being a man of your word when you rise to the challenge. To the point of doing some grossly unnecessary shit to show you’re not the dude to fuck with. Say, for example, you’re on your way to a date and she starts complaining about the restaurant you’re going to. You can cut that interaction off by saying “Well if you’ve got a problem with it, we can just go back home.” If she starts to escalate the situation even more, simply turn at the next street, drive back home, leave her there, and go out and eat at the restaurant by yourself. In the moment it will seem crazy to do some shit like that and she will likely talk shit to you all the way home. But when she is sitting at home by herself, she will know she is with a man of his word, and most importantly, YOU AIN’T A FUCKING PUSSY.

Another thing that can help with this is learning how to Dom in a BDSM sense. You’d be shocked at the amount of women who crave consensual physical abuse and will bend over backwards for men who are good at it. If you’ve never taken a journey down that road, it is a lot fun and will definitely help to shape the power dynamic in your relationship.  A big part of that is being physically intimidating so if you’re a scrawny dude or a fatty, do yourself a favor and stop being those things as quickly as possible.

WHEN IT FALLS APART - Understand this. If you are genuinely an alpha male and maintain that dynamic with your woman, she will not leave you. She may test you and threaten to, but a woman will NEVER LEAVE HER ALPHA. Not truly. If you’re in a relationship long enough there will be a time where you WILL get complacent and your woman sensing no change will try to drop a nuke on you. She will say she is leaving and taking the kids, or give you divorce papers, etc. Again, if you’re an alpha, she WON’T BE ABLE TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU. You are like a drug for her. A few days will go by and if you’ve read my breakup article, you’ll have followed it to a T and just been silent and waiting for the inevitable call or text as your unbreakable spirit will redefine what strength is to her. And in the end, she will love you harder for it.

Final Thoughts - A lot of guys are probably thinking that all of this sounds miserable but for me, it is everything. My wife’s energy is a reflection of mine, so if I’m getting shit, it’s because I’m being shit. I don’t like being complacent, I don’t like being weak. I want to face those challenges because being a man is all about rising to the occasion. My family brings out the wolf in me. I have to be big and bad for them as well as for myself. If not, my people could end up hurting and there are no greater stakes that will drive a man to greatness than the idea of failing the people that he loves. Men have an obligation to do things even if they aren’t easy when it is worth it. Having kids and raising them is the epitome of the human experience and if you throw that away because women are a little shittier today than they were 50 years ago, I’ll just call it like I see it and say you’re being a fucking pussy. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. That saying has been a defining part of my life and it’s why my journey doing this shit has paid off. I endured a lot of pain, failure, anger, frustration, and disgust, all to say fuck it, I’m going to get what I want out of life even if it kills me. Life has a way of rewarding men who get after it like that. Just my two cents.

I’ll probably expand on this article later down the road, but hopefully this provides insight for all stages interested in finding love and keeping a family together.",1643398614.0
192,Here's a whole mess of relevant quotes from Patrice O'Neal's Black Phillip Show. [Repost],376,se4pnp,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/se4pnp/heres_a_whole_mess_of_relevant_quotes_from/,50,"
Was talking to a guy in the DMs about Patrice, found a stellar post with his quotes had been removed. Had to repost and add in some footnotes, translations, clarifications etc.  Maybe it is reddit who are the real racists for suppressing a black man's wisdom. 

&#x200B;

Last few days, seen a noticeable increase in quality. You guys know who you are...keep it up.

My and Vas' back were getting kinda tired from the heavy lifting, will need some more Romanian deadlifts or back extensions I reckon. That said, still got a fair few posts cooking in my oven (alongside some members of a certain long nosed tribe), so stay tuned. 

Without further adieu: 

&#x200B;

**""You got to understand, this is not her fault. What women do when they pressure you to marry them is not their fault. That’s what the fuck they do. So you have to dismiss what she wants, dismiss that whole thing where she wants to get married, because that’s what she wants to do anyway. But them saying they want to get married is like me saying I want to eat or wake up and look at something. That’s what that marriage thing is to them. What you have to do is reestablish your shit. One thing you have to do is you have to be able to take an “L”. Not afraid to take a loss to get your point across. So when she gives you that marriage ultimatum, if you look like you’re sweating, and you’re blinking, and you’re nervous about her leaving, she will take advantage of that.""**

When pizza is good, its good. When its bad, its still pretty good. Sex is **not** like pizza boys. Check the price tag before engaging. Starfish sex no bueno. Sex after she's disrespected you no bueno. That's just telling her she can do whatever she wants and you'll forgive it for 2 minutes of romp time. Sometimes you got to lose the battle to win the war. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Stop having negotiations with women. Stop trying to give her things to make her happy so that she lets you go out to fuckin hunt and let you go out to drink. You have to say “look sweetie, this is how it is” and you have to be ready for her to walk out of your life.""**

**""One thing women need from you that if you don’t give them they fuckin flap around like a fish out of water, is emotions. If she goes “I gotta get married! And I don’t want you to go hunting!” You go “Oh sweetie we’re not gonna get married for a while, I don’t know when. And I’m going hunting right now. I’ll see you later. You don’t have to be here if you don’t want” And kiss her on the check and be really cold because now her emotions have to eat on themselves.""**

**""She’s not walking out of your life unless you’re crushed. They never walk out if you’re indifferent on the couch. If you go “goodbye, nice talking to you, I love you but you have to live your life” That bitch will not take a step. Trust me.""**

Give them an inch, they will take a mile. The only way to keep her is to cede no ground, counter intuitive, I know, but that's how it is. (A lot of game and red pill can simply be described as this and just doing the opposite of what initially comes to mind). 

Sometimes, the best move is to just kiss her on the forehead and say ""this is the way it is now."" 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""(Advice given in response to a caller who says his wife only fucks him once a year) Nothing helps a marriage more than cheating. Nothing makes it easier. When you’re cheating there’s nothing she could say that would upset you after you get home. You have to say to yourself “you can’t love a woman, like a woman loves you. You can’t give energy to her the same way she gives energy to you. You can’t go booby-bear, you can’t hold her hand because she’s holding yours. It’s a distance thing. Stay gone for a couple of days, have other things to do besides worry about how much she loves you and you love her. You gotta get a life. You don’t have a life if you’re worried about going to a bachelor party and cheating.""**

**""They don’t want what they can have. And right now I think she has you.""**

Dread or straight up cheating are powerful tools in the box. Use them when necessary. You always want to have some dread happening regardless if she's a plate, fwb or wife. Don't turn into a complete eunuch where you suddenly choose to no longer to interact with women. Where don't go out to bars/clubs anymore, you don't approach any new cuties on the street, you completely delete all your dating apps, you don't DM any new girls on insta and cut communication with anyone you were currently talking to, and you try to keep your distance with new/current women in your social circle. You can afford to cut some of these things, but you can't afford to cut **all** these things. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Most loser women, all they have to barter is their pussy. They don’t have anything else. Men have so many other things to barter when it comes to the sex game, and the relationship game. If you’re an ugly motherfucker with a hunchback and you walking with some type of swagger, everybody could be laughing and going “look at this hunchback motherfucker” but a woman might go “how could this motherfucker with a hunchback look like he should be fuckin’ me?” There are other things that make us attractive to women. Initially there’s only one thing that makes women attractive to us, and that’s fucking them. And then it builds from there. But they like us more than fucking us on the front end. We like to fuck them on the front end and then go “wow, she’s kind of cool” on the back end. So basically, you gotta understand that when you’re meeting these women, essentially, they’re losers. She has to get something out of her pussy, she has to get dinner, she has to get a movie. How can she function if she doesn’t get something out of what she has? Our bodies are not as important to us as their bodies are. So when you’re taking her out to dinner and spending time with her, you gotta understand that that’s her way of fucking you. If you take her out 5 times, she fucked you 5 times. And you haven’t fucked her yet. So basically what you’re doing is driving down a one way street, behind this bitch. And you can’t pass her. So if you find yourself getting stuck behind a chick on a one way road, you turn off the first available exit, and you get the fuck off that road. You can’t let a woman whore out your time.""**

Your time and attention are your only sources of power. You must not give them up readily. Don't be a time slut. That's just an easy route into the friendzone. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""She’s going to try and gradually take your manhood by small steps and before you know it you’re sitting in the shoe store carrying her bags. You gotta first decide what you want out of this and if what you want is sex, then that has to be obvious. And if that’s not what she wants, fine, there will be somebody else.""**

**""Fundamentally, it’s the nature of women to bitch you up. That always happens; the degree may be different from woman to woman, but it’s all about bitchin you up. And it’s organic. You cannot be angry at how they do it with such ease. It’s like brushing your teeth. Your manhood is constantly under siege, and you can’t be mad at them. It’s like being mad at a fuckin snake for biting you. If you got a rattlesnake in your hand and you’re like “this rattlesnake is the shit” and it bites you, you can’t be mad at the motherfucker. You just have to go “shit, it’s a snake”.**

**""Women have no skills to get what they want, so they hope what they want just kind of walks in. What gives you the balls to sit and wait for Mr. Right? What skills do you have to get Mr. Right?""**

Femininity is preserved, masculinity is built. The 19 year old girl has about the same value as the 30 year old millionaire. When she's on a yacht in Dubai doing all kinds of shit, some very questionable, all she had to do was be pretty and say yes. For the guy who owns the yacht, he had to hustle his way up, and learn a trillion different things along the way. 

&#x200B;

**""You have to take away what she wants (emotions) until you get what you want (sex)""**

&#x200B;

**""She’s only powerful if you let her be powerful.""**

""If you can't walk away from a negotiation, you have no power. Always be willing to walk away.""- Donald Trump 

&#x200B;

**""The amount of time it takes for her to pussy you up is the amount of time she sticks around to enjoy you being a pussy. And then she’s going to leave you.""**

&#x200B;

**""(In response to a man calling in claiming his wife wants him to be a stay at home husband) All a woman has in this world is that her man is cool. For the sake of your marriage, do not get put in a position where she thinks you aint cool. If she can’t look at you like “my man is the shit” then your marriage is over. How can you look at him like he’s the shit if he’s a stay at home fuckin’ dad?""**

You have to keep some distance from your woman. Keep some of the mystery. There's nothing sexy if she gets to see you taking your morning shit. 

&#x200B;

**""My girl said the other day “can you get off that pimp shit for once?” I go “if I do bitch, then what?” You need an opening to fag me up. Don’t let her fag you up.""**

Stay tiger. 

&#x200B;

**""A woman wants to be protected by her man, and if she can punk you up, how are you going to protect her against another man? She’s always looking to upgrade the protection.""**

A man whose willing to stand up **to** his woman, is also willing to stand up **for** his woman. Maybe this is why women like sexist jerks, if he can say shit without worrying about offending her, then he can probably protect her too. But if a guy is too scared to offend his woman, too scared to even dip his toes in being a sexist, how can she trust him to stand up to an actual threat like a man? If you can't stand up to a 120lb 5'6 foot woman, how you gonna stand up to 180lb 5'10 man? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Do the whole dating thing once or twice at the most. Because you don’t wanna do what other motherfuckers don’t do. You don’t wanna be taking her out and other motherfuckers just fuck her in the mouth on the first date. You take her out on 1-2 dates, and then you start pushing up on her. If she don’t wanna give you no pussy, you don’t go “fuck you” this and that. You always love em’ and leave em’. Just give her a kiss on the cheek, pet her on the head and say “thank you sweetie, but I don’t feel comfortable going out with you 2, 3, 4 times because I’m a viral young man who needs to fuck. I wanna be spending my time fucking you, not trying to fuck you. I know I want you now, do you want me?” You gotta make her ante up. ""**

Maybe this is a bit too overt, you can't give an ultimatum on the 2nd/3rd date. Let your actions do the talking, but yes, polarisation and escalation is important. There comes a point where you literally just have to go for it and if she rejects you, you have to cut all losses and move on. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""A happy man means a happy woman; it trickles down from the man. A happy woman doesn’t mean shit. She doesn’t know how to be happy outside of how a man makes her feel. If a motherfucker is sitting there playing Xbox 360 and you say “I’m not gonna bother this motherfucker at all”. He could be on there for 8 hours and I’m just gonna exist in my own place for 8 hours until he wants to exist with me, you just earned yourself 8 hours of happy. That motherfucker would be like “sweetie, what do you need me to do? Cause you left me alone for that 8 hours I wanted to be left alone for.” You were selling me what I wanted to buy. I wanted to buy some Xbox 360 time and you gave it to me, so you know what? I’m going to figure out how to make you happy. I’m gonna tune into you now instead of tuning out because you tried to force me to spend time with you, or force me to love you, or force me to talk to you.""**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""You should encourage the whore-ness in every bitch. The reason men don’t like women is because of what you put us through for pussy. The fact is, you could fuck me now but you’re not, just because of the “unwritten rule” of not fucking on the first date. If a chick says she doesn’t know me before we fuck, you don’t know me any better if we talk for a year.""**

True. The only way a girl can truly get to know you or truly achieve intimacy is through sex. Sex is their language they speak. Anything else is cope. Sex is the only thing that connects man and woman. Imagine if one day, all their vaginas, mouths and assholes got permanently sewn up, you would probably spend a hell of lot less time with women, wouldn't you? 

&#x200B;

**""Pussy is only valuable to whoever is fucking it at the time.""**

&#x200B;

**""Any woman is going to push your boundaries until you stop her""**

&#x200B;

**""Women hate being in charge. They don’t wanna win, they want a winner. And that’s what women test constantly, is this nigga the winner that I think he is? So you come at us and try to make us losers. And what a loser is, is a guy that lets a woman make his happiness. If you look at any woman who’s in charge, she’s not happy. She thinks she has to be mean to be the boss, she’s copying what she sees bosses do. Women don’t want to run shit, it makes them miserable. They want a man who runs shit so she can go “that’s my man”.**

Women aren't suited for power and leadership roles. Power and leadership are inherently masculine traits, only the masculine can excel at this.  And any woman who wants to excel at power and leadership will have to masculinise herself.  

E.g. Margaret Thatcher. Probably a feminist icon, definitely not a feminine icon. 

&#x200B;

**""I’m not going to bite my tongue, I’m going to tell you how I feel. Ok sweetie, I’m not going to take you out on another date. I’ve been on three dates with you. I know I want to fuck you, I don’t know if you want to fuck me, but I already know I want to fuck you. If you don’t wanna fuck me, figure it out, but were not going on anymore food excursions so I can do something for you and you’re not doing shit for me. The more you make me wait, the less it’s worth.""**

Never allow a woman make you wait for sex. It's never worth it, it's also indicative of her attraction to you. Or lack of.

&#x200B;

**""Women want to look at a guy and believe that he will lead them where they need to go. But they’re gonna test him like he’s a weak ass second mate.""**

It's all a shit test. If her mouth moves, best to treat it like a shit test. 

&#x200B;

**""If I’m the king of the castle and I marry a useless bitch, do you know what she becomes? The queen. She becomes the highest level that a woman’s title can be, in the world. Just by marrying me. I make you the best you can be. But the Queen is the King's bitch. Now, if a queen marries a motherfucker that ain’t shit, what does he become? A king? No. He’s just the motherfucker whose the queen's husband.""** 

&#x200B;

**""Guys, the only thing you really have to deal with is the threat of rejection on the front end. If I see you on the street and I go “hey what’s up” and you go “I don't like you”, all you had to do was deal with that. And once you apply that to yourself you can go “you know what, I'm just gonna stick fly paper everywhere and see what sticks.”**

**""Let’s boil it back down to pussy. Let’s say we had something that women were after every second of the day.

Cause she’s chasing your 10 G’s? And here’s the thing about my 10,000 dollars, I’m better than my 10,000 dollars. Bitches are not bigger than their pussy.""**

Guys are success objects. Girls are sex objects. And it takes a lot more to be a good success object than a good sex object.

**""You’re gonna love him before he loves you, because he’s showing you the best of him. You’re not showing the best of you before he gets pussy. Before he gets pussy, it’s him auditioning for pussy, so you’re getting the best of a guy. You’re gonna love him first.""**

A girl has to like a guy before she sleeps with him. A guy chooses whether he actually likes a girl after he sleeps with her.

The biggest prize for a woman is locking down the best man there is. No matter what Melinda Gates has accomplished or will accomplish in life, she will always be known for being the woman who locked down Bill Gates (whose been up to funny business in the last few years). Same thing for Jeff Bezos' wife. And Angelina Jolie for locking down Brad Pitt.

193,The Solution to All Your Problems With Women: Go Talk to More Girls,329,sdno6j,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/sdno6j/the_solution_to_all_your_problems_with_women_go/,81,"Over my many years on various forums and subs, making friends etc. I’ve seen hundreds (thousands?) of guys share their problems and questions about girls, getting laid, and self-improvement. When you’ve been giving advice for a while, a certain pattern starts to emerge; a pattern in the questions, and more importantly, a pattern in the solutions.

Often guys are looking for a silver bullet– a pearl of wisdom that will magically click things into place for them and solve all their problems. They’re usually hoping more thinking or a change in mindset will help you. Sometimes that’s true, but 99.9999% of the time the answer to all of your problems is:

Go hit on more girls.

Yes, doing the exact same thing you’re already doing (talking to girls & trying to have sex with them) usually fixes almost every issue you will ever have when it comes to dating, sex, relationships and keeping girls around. Talk to ’em on Tinder/Hinge/Bumble/etc. Talk to ’em in person out on the street. Talk to girls in bars. Doesn’t matter where – just hit on more girls.

You’ll find the more girls you hit on, the more you just dive right in and take action rather than sitting around overthinking everything – the majority of your problems will magically take care of themselves. 

Taking action is pretty much always more impactful than sitting around trying to gain more knowledge or coming up with a “perfect” plan.

You’d be better off going outside and saying hello to 10 girls than reading anything on any site. I got to where I am by taking action and doing things, not sitting around reading self-improvement articles. You can read articles and posts at the end of each day after you’ve taken at least one baby step to move yourself towards your goals.

# I’m way too outcome-dependent.

Being “outcome-dependent” just means you care way too much about being rejected by girls, to the point of beating yourself up every time a girl doesn’t want to suck on your sausage. And you know the only cure for caring too much about rejections? Getting rejected a shitload more, until you slowly stop caring.

I’ve lost count of the number of times a guy will come onto a forum, write 10 paragraphs about how angry he is at himself for caring too much about each rejection, and asking us for a magic cure to fix his outcome-dependency. “How can I make myself stop caring?”

The answer is always the same: there’s no way to brainwash yourself into being “outcome-dependent”. Literally the only way is to go out and hit on as many girls as humanly possible, until you simply stop giving a shit which ones aren’t into you.

And the more girls you hit on, the more you’ll start getting laid. Once you’ve had a few successes, you’ll really stop caring about rejections – because you’ll be able to tell yourself, “Well, several other girls already liked me enough to sleep with me. So it’s cool if this girl isn’t into me; I’ll go find someone who is.” Awesome; now you’re even less “outcome-dependent”.

You also need to remind yourself that this shit is entirely random– getting laid is a [“number’s game“.](https://killyourinnerloser.com/tinder-guide-3/#22-play-the-numbers-game-talk-to-as-many-girls-as-possible) Your only mission is to go hit on 100 women, then hit on 100 more, then 100 more. Keep improving yourself (looks, style, bodyfat, muscle, social life) – and keep hitting on girls. That’s all you have to do to get laid and become a better man.

To really drill it home, here’s the most recent reply I wrote to someone asking this exact question:

“You become ‘outcome independent’ by getting fucking laid. Not by trying to brainwash yourself. Stop posting, go outside and talk to more girls dude. You’re probably due for a break from the forums; you write too much. Go hit on girls.”

\---

# I just got rejected.

Go talk to more girls. For every one girl who rejects you, there’ll be another girl who’s super nice to you and makes you feel like a fucking boss for having the balls to hit on her. Don’t dwell on the one who rejected you; move on and find ones who like you.

I know rejection hurts; nobody likes it. Even now after 10,000+ rejections (it’s probably more than that, honestly) I’d still rather a girl say yes to me rather than no. Let yourself feel bad for a few minutes, don’t beat yourself up if rejection upsets you a bit, and then go talk to more girls. I promise it’ll make you feel better.

\---

I’m anxiously waiting for this girl to reply.

Two solutions to this one:

1. Keep busy and distract yourself. Hobbies, spend time with mates, work on your self-improvement, throw yourself into your job – whatever you have to do to stop obsessing about her replying to you.

2. Hit on more girls.

Everyone stresses about girls taking a while to reply to them when they’re a newbie, so don’t beat yourself up over that. Talking to more girls fixes it immediately though; it’s really hard to give a crap about a girl taking ages to reply when you’ve got 3 other numbers in your phone. 1 is the loneliest number; life is a lot easier when you have multiple girls you’re talking to/banging.

If you find yourself obsessively checking your phone for replies on Tinder/text, use an app like Stay Focused to block Tinder (including notifications) for a certain time of the day. I have it set up so I can only access Tinder from 6pm to midnight – so the entire rest of the day I won’t be bothered by notifications and won’t be tempted to check if a girl has replied.

Off the Gridi s another great app – it locks you out of your phone (except for making phone calls) for an amount of time you set.

Example: A guy was asking about a girl he was trying to organise a date with. He was beating himself up for caring too much about whether or not she replied. Here’s what I wrote:

“You say ‘I’m not gonna invest in her too much’ – you’re already invested, or you wouldn’t have posted multiple times on here in just a few hours asking about the same girl.

Cut yourself some slack; you’re a newbie to this, so you’re going to care a hell of a lot about each girl replying or not replying to your texts. God knows I anxiously and neurotically checked my phone 20 times an hour in the beginning, praying a girl would reply to me, getting angry when she didn’t, swearing I’d never speak to her again, then gushing like a little schoolgirl when she finally replied.

The one thing that makes it all better is going out and talking to more girls. You’ve gotta keep busy and distract yourself.”

# I fucked things up with this girl.

If there’s one thing that’s worse than rejection when you’re a newbie, it’s the regret from pussying out. Nothing makes you feel worse than knowing you could have asked for her number, or kissed her, or fucked her – but you didn’t make a move. There was nothing standing in your way, except yourself.

I’ve pussied out on tens of thousands of girls at this point (no exaggeration) – I used to walk around my city pussying out on hundreds of girls for hours and hours and hours, before finally working up the courage to just fucking talk to one. And even when I went on dates, I was far too nervous/scared to hold their hand, or kiss them, or invite them back to my apartment. I must have lost hundreds (thousands?) of opportunities because of fear.

I also “fucked things up” with girls I was dating. Maybe I didn’t text them too much, or maybe I texted them too much. Maybe I got lazy and stopped improving myself, and they got bored and left. Some girls I was way too cold to. Others I was too jealous and needy. A lot of girls left me early on when I had no idea what I was doing.

And that’s the point: I had no idea what I was doing.You need to cut yourself some slack if you don’t have a lot of experience with women. You’re going to fuck things up. Some girls won’t stick around no matter how much you want them to; particularly if you don’t have your shit together yet. You can’t beat yourself up over it; your only job is to go out and hit on more girls, get more experience, keep improving yourself and you’ll naturally get better with women over time.

I do get the regret though. I get the overthinking it. I get beating yourself up. I get sitting around for hours ruminating on it, trying to come up with a way to fix it. “If only I had a fucking time machine, I could go back and do it all over again properly.”

Well, son, you have a time machine (sort of) – it’s called going out and hitting on more girls.You can’t have a do-over with the girl you chickened out on, but the good news is you have unlimited tries. No matter how many girls you fuck things up with, you can always go talk to a new girl. You can’t wallow in the past when the present is right here. The present won’t wait for you.

Example:A guy asked me for some advice about a girl he met in public, talked to for a bit, but was too scared to ask for her number. He was coming up with all these plans to have an excuse to go back to where he met her and then ask for her number. He was getting himself all worked up, really stressing and beating himself up over the fact he chickened out. My reply:

“I dont even have to read this big wall of text you just wrote to know the answer to your question will be, ‘Go talk to more girls’.Yep, having now read everything you just wrote… The answer is still, you guessed it: go talk to more girls. Go back and ask for this girl’s number, sure. But you wouldn’t even be asking this question if you were hitting on more girls. You’d just tell yourself, ‘Oh well, I chickened out on her, I’m a little pussy. Doesn’t matter; I’ll go talk to 3 other girls today.”

# This girl stopped responding / ghosted me.

If a girl stops responding to your texts (a girl you haven’t met up with yet), just delete her number and go talk to more girls. I know it can be frustrating if you’ve put in quite a bit of time talking to her and started getting excited to meet her – that’s exactly why I say not to waste time having long conversations. But if she’s no longer responding, the writing is on the wall – she’s not interested. Forget her and go talk to more girls.

And for god’s sake, don’t worry about what you might have said “wrong” to this particular girl, don’t worry about how to get her to keep talking to you (talking to a girl for ages doesn’t mean you’re making progress). Just let her go, like a leaf on the wind. Go out and find the next girl to talk to.

In the case of ghosting(a girl you’ve already banged just stops replying to your messages all of a sudden, without telling you why), that’s shitty of her and it sucks it’s happened to you. And then go hit on more girls.

&#x200B;

# I feel needy / clingy with this girl I’m banging.

Neediness and being too over-invested in a girl is a horrible feeling; I’m speaking from experience.

When you’re needy/clingy, you get into this horrible situation where you feel like you need her more than she needs you. That can quickly turn into worries of, “What if I never get my needs met? What if I’m dissatisfied and unhappy forever?”

You start overthinking everything and worrying too much about it all. It feels awful– you feel like you care about and she doesn’t care about you (even if she does). You get clingy and attached, ruining the relationship because you can never actually relax and just be in the moment with her – you’re always analysing your every move, thinking, “Is this too clingy? Can she tell how needy I am? Does she secretly hate me?”

Sometimes the pressure gets too much and you self-sabotage; maybe having a big fight, “You don’t care about me!” Or maybe you do what I’ve done in the past – break up with girls (and then be left with NO girls to fuck) just to run away from my own clinginess.

The answer is to go talk to more girls and build up some options – you need to show yourself there’s other girls in the world who’ll like you, so you’re not so afraid of any one girl leaving you. Over time your neediness will fade away as you relax, knowing you have some options out there.

If you’re in a monogamous relationship and talking to other girls is off the table, then build yourself a social life so you’re not relying on your girl for all your social/emotional needs. Make friends, try new hobbies – you need to build up at least a couple of people you can rely on to talk things through, to socialise with, and to handle your emotional needs.

# My serious relationship just ended.

If you’ve been with a girl for a while (months), even if you guys were only casual, it’s going to suck when things end. Being sad over a breakup and missing an ex is a completely normal and healthy reaction.

The only thing that makes that better is distracting yourself – focusing on your hobbies, friends, etc. And the best distraction of all – as well as the best closure – is forcing yourself to talk to more girls. Yes, you may need to grieve for a few days/a couple of weeks; be kind to yourself and keep as busy as you possibly can so the time passes quicker (time heals all wounds). Then push yourself to go talk to more girls.

It’ll be hard as first, but you can do it. Thousands of men have moved on before you, and you will too. As soon as you show yourself there’s other options out there, you’ll start to feel a little better. You’ll feel like, “Ok. I still miss my ex, but at least my life is starting to continue forward.”

And when you do meet the next girl and have sex with her, you will have an epiphany: “Holy shit, I don’t have to be stuck on my ex forever. There are other women in the world I can spend my time with.” Yes, you’ll probably still miss your ex a bit. Yes, you’ll probably still miss her. But you’ll be starting to heal by moving on.

You need to just trust me on this one: talking to other girls will make you feel better. Not immediately – it takes a little time to move on – but each new girl you talk to will make you feel 5-10% better.

And if you think, “But my ex was the one! I’ll never find another girl like her!” There is no “the one”– there’s lots of “ones”. Lots of girls who’ll be an amazing match for you and who’ll rock your fucking world. Hitting on and meeting more girls will show you that. Not to mention talking to other girls is making progress instead of sitting around focusing on the past.

That doesn’t mean you forget about your ex or never think about her again. You’ll always have the happy memories you two shared together. But for right now, when you’re sad and miserable and feeling shitty, you need to force yourself to go out and hit on more girls. Even if it’s hard at first – it’ll get easier for each new girl you hit on.

# My fuckbuddy is busy / can’t see me this week.

Ask yourself this: “If I had a second girl I was banging, would I care that this girl is busy?”

Probably not. So, go talk to more girls.

I know it’s frustrating when your fuckbuddy/friends with benefits has plans, is on her period (you can always have anal sex instead), etc and doesn’t want to meet you. Early on when I was just starting to get laid, a few times I was in a position where I only had 1 fuckbuddy and she was busy. It frustrated the hell out of me – I was horny, really wanting to get laid, and my only option wasn’t available right now.

Know what fixed it? Going out and talking to more girls. Not only did that instantly make me feel better because I was interacting with new girls (even just talkingto girls makes you feel pretty good – it’s rewarding in itself when you’re newbie). But some of those girls wanted to go on a date with me and some of them wanted to have sex with me; which fixed my “I have no options” problem.

The worst feeling for a guy who’s working on getting laid is lack of options. Go out and talk to a tonne of girls (or message a bunch on Tinder), and proveto yourself you have options. There’s 4 billion girls on the planet; you have options. It’s up to you to go say hi to them.

You’ll sometimes find if your fuckbuddy is busy for a week, you’ll go talk to a tonne of girls, and that’ll pass the time in itself (while also being a productive use of your time). A week will pass, your fuckbuddy will hit you up to meet, and you’ll go, “Oh wow, it’s already been a week? Hell yeah let’s meet!”

&#x200B;

\---

# I have a theory about something…

Often guys will tell me they have a theory about something to do with getting laid – sometimes it’s, “I have a theory that wearing black clothes makes girls more likely to give you their number, because black is a badboy colour.”

“I have a theory that me carrying my big camera around will make girls think I’m more interesting, and therefore I’ll get laid more.”

“I have a theory that telling girls I’m only here for a few weeks will make them less likely to sleep with me, because they’ll know there’s a time-limit to things.”

The problem with all these theories is they’re just that; theories. You already know my thoughts on unfounded theories. What you’re supposed to do is go outside and actually experiment with your theory – put it to the test. Debating weird theories you invented gets you no closer to getting laid than sitting at home staring at a wall.

Example: A guy wrote 10 paragraphs about his theory/question: “Can being a photographer help you get laid?” He went on and on and on about it,

“We’re against theory posts here, dude – go out and take ACTION.

In the time you wrote all this, you could have gone outside and asked 10 girls if you can take their photo, then said, ‘Actually, you’re really cute. Wanna grab a drink with me sometime? What’s your number.'”

Now stop posting, and go outside and talk to girls.”

The problem is guys think they’re being productive when they write these theory threads.You think, “I’m figuring stuff out, I’m gaining more knowledge – this is helping me get laid!”

Nah, it’s doing jack shit to get you laid. You’re just sitting around mental-masturbating. The time you waste coming up with your theory, posting it, and then debating the topic with other people is time you could have spent hitting on 50 women, one of whom would have slept with you.

&#x200B;

\---

# I have “Approach Anxiety”.

When you have approach anxiety (being nervous about hitting on girls) – the only solution is to force yourself to hit on more girls. Yes, it’s fucking terrifying – beating my approach anxiety was the hardest thing I ever did (and the most terrifying). I had several breakdowns. It was absolutely worth it.

Forcing yourself to talk to girls is exposure therapy– the only way to make anxiety/fear/nerves go away. You can’t brainwash yourself into just not feeling anxiety; the only way to get comfortable hitting on girls is to actually hit on girls.

Being full of fear is totally ok; it’s normal. A man isn’t courageous because he acts without fear. A man is courageous because he acts in spite of the fear.

\---

# She said, “I have a boyfriend/I’m married”.

I know this is a radical notion for a lot of “pickup-artists”, but when a girl tells you she has a boyfriend or is married: she’s politely rejecting you.

“I have a boyfriend” is often something girls say when they’re trying to reject you as nicely as possible. Maybe she’s not into you, or she’s not in a good mood, or she doesn’t like giving her number out to someone she just met, etc. In those cases, girls will give an automatic, “Sorry, I have a boyfriend” as a polite catch-all when they don’t want to go any further. Respect what she’s saying to you, instead of thinking you can manipulate/get around what she’s just said. Move on and go hit on more girls.

I know a lot of pickup artists talk about winning a girl over even if she has a boyfriend. Is that really worth it to you? First of all, she’s just turned you down – don’t you want to hold your head up high, have some pride in yourself, and get laid with girls who don’t make it a fucking battle to have sex with them?

And in the case where she actually does have a boyfriend – do you really want to deal with that? Girls with boyfriends can often bring more drama and are way more hassle; you basically have to fight her every step of the way, trying desperately to convince her to cheat on her boyfriend/husband for you. Not to mention he may find out and start throwing drama at you as well. Are you so desperate and attached to this one girl, you can’t go find another one?Don’t you have other options?

Of course you do; even if you think you don’t right now. There are 4 billion other girls on the planet. A tonne of them will be single. Go hit on those ones instead, and leave the attached girls to their boyfriends/husbands (whether made up or real).

&#x200B;

\---

# This girl I’m dating has dealbreakers.

Go talk to more girls.In a lot of cases if there’s no chance of compromise and the girl you’re seeing has dealbreakers/huge red flags, it’s better to go find a new girl who’ll match up with you better. Trust me, speaking from experience it is damn hard to change someone. It’s usually a fool’s errand.

Not to mention, trying to force a girl to be something/someone she really doesn’t want to (or can’t) be leads to certain drama. And a tonne of anxiety on your part, as you stress yourself trying to change her. You’re better off finding a girl who ticks more of your boxes; a girl you don’t have to spend so much effort trying to change. One you can build something awesome with right from the start.

Don’t try and squash a square peg in a round hole. Go hit on more girls and find one who’s more suited to you and what you’re looking for.

&#x200B;

\---

# I want to bang hotter girls.

Another easy one: go hit on more girls.

A lot of guys overcomplicate this, saying, “But I don’t want to lower my standards!” If you’re inexperienced, you don’t have a choice: lower your standards. You can’t expect to bang hot girls if you don’t have much experience or practice getting laid with average or “cute” girls.

You certainly don’t bang hot girls by having less sex and being more fussy. “I want to bang hot girls, therefore I won’t even talk to any girl below an 8.” That’s a surefire way to end up lonely as hell and make yourself needy. After all, if you aren’t banging any girls right now, do you think you’ll do better with the hot girls, or do you think you’ll be “outcome-dependent” as we talked about above?

Think of cute girls as training in order to be able to bang the hottest girls. They’ll make you more confident, you’ll get some practice sticking to a gameplan and knowing how to get laid, and some of them will be absolute sweethearts to you and will make great fuckbuddies. Getting laid makes you a better man– which helps you pull the hotter girls you really want. Who knows, by not being so fussy, you might even meet some girls you really really like & want to keep around.

I have a lot of experience with this– I started out really nervous around hot girls and I couldn’t even talk to them, let alone hit on them and try to bang them. Even if I somehow accidentally got them into the bedroom, I would have been too nervous to even get it up. 

How’d I deal with my weirdness around hot girls? I focused on the average and cute girls instead – the girls I was semi-comfortable hitting on. I gained a lot of experienced, had a lot of lays and made a lot of awesome memories, and guess what? I became more confident.

Then I was able to start hitting on the hot girls, and even though I was still pretty nervous, I was no longer terrified of them. I banged a couple, using the experienced I gained from all the previous girls, and got myself to a point where I now only bang girls I’m really attracted to 

If you want hot girls, go hit on a lot of girls.

&#x200B;

\---

# I want to have a 3some.

Having a 3some isn’t that hard – just hit on a bunch of girls until you find 2 who are up for a 3some. Here's some basics:

1. Ask each one: “Ever fooled around with another girl, or thought about it?”

2. Keep hitting on more girls and asking each new fuckbuddy this question. When you have 2 girls who are both up for fooling around together, show them each other’s pics.

3. If they like each other, invite them both around one night, have some wine, and go for it.

4. If you’re nervous to start, just have a glass of wine each, and then just kiss one of them – the rest will naturally follow, I promise. Or you can say, “You two should kiss” and they will – then the rest will follow. Your first 3some won’t be smooth, it’ll be a learning experience – that’s cool. Have fun with it; nobody expects you to be a sex god the first time. 

So once again the solution is: Go hit on more girls.

&#x200B;

\---

# This girl just told me, “Let’s just be friends”.

Sucks, but move on and talk to more girls.

Your only power is the ability to do your own thing. You can’t make a girl want to fuck you if she’s said explicitly she wants to be friends. “If I had another girl I was banging, would I care that this girl only wants to be friends?” What if I had 2 girls I was banging?”

Course not, you’d already be getting sex – especially if you had at least two fuckbuddies. The friendzone thing would barely even register.

&#x200B;

\---

# This girl I was talking to seemed totally DTF, then changed her mind last minute.

I know it’s frustrating as hell – especially when you were so close. Do what I said above: unmatch/block her, then move on and talk to more girls. Use the frustration of her not banging you as motivation to go talk to 10 more girls – go nuts.

Example: A guy was stressing about a girl he was flirting with and got a number off. They were hitting it off, she seemed very keen to meet him… and then she just decided she didn’t want to meet him. He was asking what things he could do or say to get her to change her mind (even though she’d made it very clear she didn’t want to meet any more). I wrote:

“Don’t stress too much about this – you did everything about as well as you could have done. Some girls aren’t going to fuck you no matter how perfect things seem, no matter how much they seem into you. Girls are like a leaf on the wind – they often change direction from moment to moment.

Don’t write anything back to her. She said, “I cannot speak to you any more”. Respect that and move on – go talk to more girls. There’s 4 billion other girls on the planet for you to talk to.

Again, you did everything right here. Forget her and go hit on the next one.”

&#x200B;

# I hate women.

I know this isn’t what you’ll want to hear if you hate women, but the only way to hate them less is to spend more time with them. You’ll eventually come to see women are just like men; there are some bad ones, some average ones, and some truly amazing ones. You need to give yourself the chance to meet the amazing ones, and the only way to do that is to – you guessed it – hit on more women.

Over time, you’ll naturally hate women less and less, and will eventually start to like them. I absolutely detested women (and “female nature”) at the start; that changed, slowly, as I got to know a few really sweet girls. Do your best to look for the good in women; try your hardest to find examples of kindness, loyalty and sweetness. There’s plenty of it out there if you try to find it.

Go hit on more girls. It’s ok if you are bitter at the start; that’ll change over time. Try to keep an open mind and just trust what I’m telling you: spending time with lots of women will (eventually) solve your women-hating issues. You’ll find some women are absolute sweethearts; you just have to find them.

For the longest time, I really hated women – I’ve talked about it on this sub. I hated everything about them, I totally detested them – I wanted to hate them. But over time I met too many really lovely girls who softened my heart and wore down my resolve to hate them; really genuinely good, kind people who wanted the best for me and added a lot to my life. No matter how hard I tried (and I really did try) I couldn’t hate them. They were just too kind.

Eventually I realised, “If these girls are genuinely good people… maybe there’s other girls who are good people.” I kept talking to more girls, started actively trying to find the good ones, and started running away from the bad ones. These days my life is full of only good women – I don’t let myself dislike any women. If I feel myself starting to dislike a girl when I’m talking to her on Tinder/via text, I immediately unmatch her and talk to a girl who makes me like her.

If you hate women, your path to hating them less is the same as mine: go hit on more girls.

# I’m bad at sex.

Easy one. If you have a girlfriend/fuckbuddy right now, have a lot of sex with her and practice. But if you don’t have a girl you’re seeing…

Go talk to more girls.

The more girls you date/bang, the more you’ll be able to practice foreplay, sex, making girls orgasm, etc. Being good at sex just takes practice; like everything else.

&#x200B;

\---

You’re seeing a pattern…

Yep – just about every problem you throw at me can be solved with, ""Go talk to more girls”.

I could come up with 100 more examples of times where your problem seems unique and different to the examples above, and you’re convinced it must have a unique answer… but the answer still ends up being, go talk to more fucking girls.

Don’t be a pussy.

Get off this sub and talk to more girls. Right now.",1643251284.0
194,Unorthodox Seduction Strategies That'll Put Some Hair On Your Chest,89,sdmcr1,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/sdmcr1/unorthodox_seduction_strategies_thatll_put_some/,57,"Pickup can be a cute game in which you approach a girl, have a friendly chat, and get her number.

That's the boy's version of seduction. 

It rarely leads to anything but flakey numbers and pats on the back followed by, ""It was nice meeting you!""

There's also the man's version of seduction. 

It's what makes a girl feel tingles run down her spine.

What am I talking about exactly?

Pure sexual dominance.

It's the feeling women get when they read ""50 Shades of Grey."" 

This is what turns girls on more than anything. They don't want a polite interaction that's really a business exchange.

They want to feel your Id (the primal part of your personality). Real seduction is distinctly uncivilized and impolite. 

Sadly, most men completely cut themselves off from this side of themselves because social conditioning teaches us to be ashamed of it.

We learn that our raw sexual energy is, in-fact, creepy.

And although it can be creepy when misdirected, it is also the most charismatic, powerful part of your psyche when you learn to tap into it.  

Here are two ways to project this energy:

&nbsp;

##1. Look at a woman and think, ""I want you.""

&nbsp;

Literally let sexual thoughts run through your mind, ""I want to bend you over."" ""I want you to suck my...""

You can even imagine the woman you're talking to getting naked.

Think about what it would be like to have her begging you to sleep with her. 

These thoughts change the energy you project. 

Instead of boyish, your energy becomes completely masculine—she can sense you're not messing around.

And although some women will reject you, you will put many others under your spell because you are giving them the chance to experience a release from the need to act polite and civilized. 

&nbsp;

##2. Tell her what you want. 

&nbsp;

This is extremely bold, and if you hesitate, it won't work.
 
For context, as a social experiment, I approached 20 women and asked them, ""Would you like to have sex?"" 

19 said no. 

One said, ""Well, I'd have to get to know you better.""

I ended up in her bedroom within an hour.

Of course, opening a conversation with that question isn't the highest percentage play. 

But once you've made a conversation flirtatious, you can dial it up to a 10 by telling her something to the effect of, ""You're so sexy. I want to go down on you until you come several times..."" 

Try that at your own risk. 

But you'd be surprised how often direct, unashamed sexuality turns women on. 

Most men are so timid that if you're bold, you'll give her a rare experience that she won't forget.

Do you have to do either of these things to pickup women?

No.

But if you want to take things to the next level and truly seduce women instead of just running ""game,"" the mindset needs to be primal, not logical. 

Get in touch with your deepest sexual instincts and take off the polite mask you've learned to wear. 

Doing so will give you power women won't be able to resist.",1643247476.0
195,Lessons From My RSD Bootcamp,111,sdb5hg,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/sdb5hg/lessons_from_my_rsd_bootcamp/,100,"**Recently, I took a Bootcamp with RSDTyler.**  
**Here's a quick summary:**   
I, and 15 others, spent around 36 hours over a 3 day period with his coaches (mostly lectures + group exercises) and maybe around 4 hours total with Tyler himself in a group setting. The coaches were great but don't be deceived by his proposition if you think you'll get 36 hours of straight Tyler. The coaches taught us the fundamentals: 6 steps to your night out, the progression of an interaction, and the necessity of Instagram (all good information). Then at night we went out and gamed. At the end of the night, everyone meets up with the coaches and Tyler and do a recap (the good, the bad, what to improve). Wash rinse repeat.

**Now for my personal feelings and stuff:**   
The reason I took the bootcamp was because I had not been able to get into ""the zone"" or ""state"" for many months. If you have never been in state before while socializing, I pity you. It is like you become superman. Or, rather, you become yourself without all those gay inhibitions and fears and self-doubt and so on. Women literally tell you they love you when you say hello to them. Your eye contact is effortless. Living is euphoric. Each breath tastes like the sweetest cocaine you have ever gummed. I could wax poetic for hours and hours. It simply makes life worth living. It's called ""the winner effect"" (it's a book too if you want to read aboot it).I really don't want to recap all the shit I learned on the bootcamp because it's not actually that important. If you really care to know, you can message my ass and I'll chit chat with you about it.The real epiphany came a week after when I went out again. To preface, I had fallen into a 3 month bout of apathy after some shit went down and, as I'm sure you know, apathy is gay and cringe. It's a meaningless cesspool of hedonism and hopelessness. At this point in my life, RSDTyler was the last point of ""authority"" in my life or as Jacques Lacan coined ""the subject supposed to know"". This was of course because of the large catalog of videos he made which were very formative in my journey of self-development. Point is, I wanted to speak to him directly so he could solve my problems (naive). Well, that didn't happen on the bootcamp because you aren't really with him that much but that's whatever. So now onto the unironically life changing epiphany...

**My Unironic Life-Changing Epiphany:**   
FYI, this might seem really dumb and obvious and I am aware of that. On my drive to the club the week after the bootcamp, it sort of randomly dawned on me that I wanted Tyler's sympathy for how hard Game has been. If you're anything like me, you have had nights out where you just stammer around the venue trying to stay the fuck alive, much less interact with people, because your brain perceives a ton of threat and stress from the environment. It is absolutely horrendous. And especially so because being ""in the zone"" is so phenomenally great that you keep putting yourself in those situations. Anyways, in my car, I realized that I wanted his sympathy and that's the real reason why I went on the bootcamp. And that's what I want to elaborate on in this post.

**On Sympathy, Validation, Approval, etc.:**   
I can specifically identify the logic of how to break out of this vicious cycle. The correct attitude is to staunchly **not want** sympathy (obvious I know) but not because it makes you a weak pussy (which it certainly does) but because **even if** you were to get the sympathy, **it literally would not even help you improve**. No matter how innocuous it may seem to have someone's sympathy, it was a hamper on my progression. The reason why I had been unable to get ""into the zone"" was because I was relying (call it subconsciously I guess) on other people's positive reactions in order to pump my state. While it certainly did help introduce ""the zone"" to me at first, this was a shoddy, unreliable foundation on which to build my sociability/game. Call it validation, call it approval, call it whatever you like. In a chaotic environment like a night club, your brain goes into defense mode and you ""subconsciously"" turn to others for their approval, validation, sympathy, etc. in order to... I guess survive?... Not die?

**Improvement Therefrom:**   
So that night of the epiphany, I decided to staunchly oppose/reject my desire for sympathy (and synonyms) and accepted the fact that some people might think it weird that I talk to random people (which of course is not at all weird but the objective fact is that your brain imagines threats and consequences) or say certain things or talk in a certain way but I don't really care about whether or not they think it is weird (in one sense I do care and in another I do not care) and, that night and the night after, I had two great nights in a fucking row and I was on top of the fucking world.

**Conclusion/TL:DR:**   
I wish to emphasize that ""not caring about validation"", or however you may posit your aloof attitude towards validation, is specifically not the same as ""not wanting validation"" (disowning?). This is not to say ""piss people off"" (we go out to socialize/game to have fun with other people, keep it light of course), but it is to recognize the inefficiency and undesirability of getting ""in the zone"" or ""pumping your state"" based off of other people's positive reactions. This is to say that I specifically **do not want** to get ""into the zone"" off their reactions because it would only reinforce reliance on an unreliable source.

**THE FUTURE:** I can explain this better but you'd have to know Pook and RSD and Lacanian Psychoanalysis which GayLubeOil should have hopefully put you onto. The next question is ""how to get in the zone if not based on positive feedback?"" On the surface, it seems like a totally reasonable concept: we go out to socialize, when we are nice to other people and they like us, we will feel accepted in this environment/in this group and thus feel good. But you must look further. I'd have to write another post aboot it or you can ask me if you wanna talk about it.

**P.S.:** Sorry if this didn't make sense. If you love game and care enough, you can message me and I'll chit chat with you about it.",1643217699.0
196,West Elm Caleb Dates Like a Girl; Women of TikTok OUTRAGED!,189,scq7us,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/scq7us/west_elm_caleb_dates_like_a_girl_women_of_tiktok/,104,"**West Elm Caleb Dates Like a Girl; Women of TikTok OUTRAGED!**

So evidently there is a 20-something gent in Brooklyn, 6'4"" - pause for short guys^1 to vent a raging *""Hah!  We told you so!!""* - nice square jaw from the one photo I saw, and who works (again evidently), as a furniture designer at West Elm.^2  who behaved rather like a cad on dating apps, and it turns out that the ladies no likey.  Caleb is, per the *""J'Accuse""* of the TikTok Ladies, a Ted Kaczynski-level Love Bomber, as well as a Serial Ghoster. 


*""The Feministas of the 60s broke the pussy cartel.  They hoped it would give women freedom.  Instead, women won the battle, but lost the war.""*

-From, The Sayings of Chairman Zaitzev

The problem ladies have is that 90% of dudes are not in the top 10%.  Being hypergamous, they want to keep their options open...until they snag a top 10% guy, and then, suddenly, they want exclusivity.  

I first became aware of Caddish Caleb from Twitter, where I maintain a fake account to troll my friends. Someone posted a video from a tall (like 6' tall) woman named ""Kate"" who admitted that she wanted to add Caleb ""To her arsenal.""  

That's important.  Kate wanted Caleb and to keep her options open, but then got MAD when he was doing the same thing.  Given that Kate only wants guys taller than she is - and, IMO, short guys, you are not missing out - and that she has a future, IMO, as a [Norwegian kitchen witch](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/8b/30/56/8b3056518cd5377818dbf55c5b174d81.jpg), or possibly and [evil stepsister](https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/2021/04/16/cinderella-stepsisters-main.jpg), one would think she would want to lock a guy down.

At least two other gals made videos about him - some blonde girl who as kind of basic and an Asian chick.  What we know about Caleb is that he liked a lot of strange and was keeping a bunch of girls on the go.

Evidently he rolled out of Basic Blonde girl's bed on Saturday morning, took Kate out that night and possibly Sunday.  He and Basic Blonde had been dating for 6 weeks, so she says, which means that she was his ""comfort food"" for nights when he didn't otherwise hookup.  Not sure how the Asian girl fit in, as I haven't researched it.

*""The most SAVAGE thing you can do to a woman demanding equality, is to give it to her.""* - Paul Elam

So there are a few things that ~~Chad~~ Caleb did that I disagree with.  Evidently he was not upfront with the ladies about not being exclusive.  I am *clear*  about being non-monogamous and he might not have been.  I say ""might"" because this is the women saying so, and women are notorious for hearing what they *want* to hear.  

He also - allegedly - sent an unsolicited dic pic to someone - NEVER do this by the way.  It def is creepy and weird.  That said, the woman evidently agreed to meet h him again, thus he status as a Chad is confirmed.  I think she was fucking him already *and* his dick game was on-point (even if his ""game"" skills were not.)

He also allegedly lied about being off of Hinge or whatever but I assume everyone lies about that.  

Oh, and now he's doxxed, and up on a billboard.  Angry bitches be ANGRY.

Bottom Line:  App for Meaningless Sex Delivers On Its Promise of Meaningless Sex; Feminists OUTRAGED.

**Takeaways:**


A.  Hell hath no fury like a player girl who gets *PLAYED*.

B.  Never send unsolicited dic pics.

C.  Women want equality when it favors them, but special treatment when it doesn't.

D.  Be upfront about your non-intentions.  It still won't save you, but still. 

=================

^1  I have come around on this.  I think the short guys have a point.  It doesn't mean that everything is *easy* for tall guys - I assure you, it is not - but they do have a point.

^2 West Elm should capitalize this by naming a bed after him and some other items - perhaps doorknobs - after his girls.",1643151033.0
197,My Time In SOF And Why Being Dangerous Drives Women Crazy,354,sacjs3,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/sacjs3/my_time_in_sof_and_why_being_dangerous_drives/,116,"Hey RP. Good evening.

Today I'm going to cover my time in SOF (Special Operations Forces) and what I've learned from the crazy shit I've done and seen working with some of the baddest men on the planet.

For reference, I'm not an operator. I'm an enabler, what people outside the community often call the support component. We are the roadies to their rock stars and like the road crews of legend, we also get to do and see some crazy shit. My job affords me the opportunity to be farmed out to different teams, and within those teams, my job requires me to become embedded with a platoon of operators during the work up and deployment cycle.

I live with them, train with them, hang out with them, go out drinking with them, go shooting with them, go out on ops with them, everything. I've also been extremely lucky by going through some of the coolest and most grueling training the military has to offer including SERE and becoming Airborne. Spending time with these dudes and earning their respect is literally an avenue to learn the dynamics of what RP is trying to get you to become.

A lot of these dudes are naturals, winners from the day they were born. Others came from shitty backgrounds and used that pain to will themselves into battle hardened soldiers who demand respect any time they walk into a room. What none of them are are fucking posers, and if you have an ounce of weakness in you, they will find it and put you through the gauntlet for it (even in a joking manner if they like you, which is how dudes at this level often are).

Today I'm going to cover some of the realities of what it's like to work with these guys, and how you can start to do the work to find the danger within yourself, and how when women SENSE that danger, it will become like a drug for them.

1. **There are levels to everything** \- One of the first things I learned the first time I cut over to a team is the reality that while all these dudes are in the 1% of pipe hitters in the military, and ALL of them are in the top 10% of men in a RP sense, there was a very distinct hierarchy amongst their ranks. The most senior operator at our command was a small, quiet 5'4"" with kind eyes like a grandpa. But when he walked down the hallway EVERYBODY, even the biggest, most jacked and wild eyed operator, moved out of his way. He didn't force it. He didn't say anything when it happened. It simply was. Why? He was revered and was a legend in his own right. He'd done more than 20 years at a Tier 1 (think CAG or DEVGRU) command and was rumored to have more than 300 kills to his name. And this reality worked its way down to the lowest ranks. The newest guys fresh out of the training pipeline did all the shit work and said ""Thank you"" when they got it. Even though they had proven themselves to be amongst the toughest men on the planet, when it came to the team they were now attached to, they weren't shit and weren't gonna be shit until they deployed. And then they'd be 1 pumpers who didn't know shit about what a hard deployment was. So with that, understand that as you grow in your RP journey, there are never ending levels to this shit, even at the highest levels of masculinity.

2. **Competition creates friendship with men who have value** \- You think you're competitive with other men at work? Try working with fucking operators. Competition starts in the training pipeline and never stops. The goal during every evolution is to WIN, and humiliate those faggots over there trying to keep up with us. That means if you fuck up and they have to pay, you better own up to it and suffer the consequences worse than everybody else. But with that comes a constant pursuit of excellence. And the mental barriers you place on yourself on a daily basis are eroded quickly as you watch these dudes fucking CRUSH whatever it is that they're doing. As an example, my OIC on an op got bored while we were waiting for something to pop off and decided on a whim he was going to run 100 miles in 24 hours. And the next day he DID IT. On a treadmill, with no headphones or anything, while staring at a wall. Just put it into his head and then did it. And then did 10 evolutions on a caving ladder the next day in full kit (which can weigh 80-100lbs). Because fuck you, that's why. There are dudes like that at EVERY DESK in SOF. Absolute skull crushing warriors that don't have time for excuses or “I can't.” And when you spend enough time around them, you realize you can do a lot more than you think you can, outright. Want to learn how to make friends easily? Learn how to be comfortable being competitive with other men.

3. **Strength is a currency** \- Operators are notoriously finicky when it comes to the support personnel that they accept and respect. Some they treat like absolute shit. Others they would die for in a heartbeat. The first time I deployed with a platoon, I had never met any of them as we were boarding the plane going to our final destination. I was expected to keep track of, maintain and program a lot of their equipment. So what was the secret to my earning their trust in the short amount of time I needed to? When we landed and after we got the initial check in process done, we all hit the gym. My PRs are as follows - Deadlift: 475lb (no straps, no belt) - Squat: 375lb (ATG, no belt) Bench Press: 315lb (no straps). I could lift more weight than some operators and when they saw that, they immediately started to rag on those operators I was out lifting. For guys in this community, your strength and spirit are currencies. If you're a fantastic enabler who is fat and dumpy, they'll still choose the buff guy who is decent at their job over you. Why? He can be trusted because he can keep up. This reality applies in life too. If you’re competent and big, people in all avenues of life simply treat you differently. When these dudes go out anywhere, you can see this reality play out, even if the people they are dealing with don’t know what they do. People can sense it.

4. **Danger is like catnip for women** – Speaking of sensing dangerous men, want to know who has absolute no issues talking to and bedding women left and right? Operators. Any time we would go out, every single dude would line up the 9s and 10s at the bars consistently. They wouldn't need to mention what they do or qualify themselves. The WAY they approached women said everything, and THAT IS THE REALITY OF WHAT A TRUE ALPHA MALE EXPERIENCES. If an encounter wasn't going their way, they'd simply walk away from the chick mid-conversation and talk to her friend right next to her. And one way or another, word around the bar would spread and the general vibe from the women would only get crazier. Why? Because women LOVE dangerous men. Want to know the fastest way to become an alpha? Become dangerous. There is no fronting with dangerous men, you either are one or you aren't and it is the purest form of alpha that exists on the planet. Can you fuck up other men and take their possessions? Can you exude that energy? You can be famous and you can be rich, but nothing will get a woman wet like the presence of a dangerous man. Operators are as real as it gets and the women they encounter reflect that reality.

So with that, I'll finish with a brief discussion about what you can do to become more dangerous.

If you're young and have nothing really going for you, talk to a recruiter and get an 18X or BUD/S contact. Seriously, the life that operators live is something to behold and the suffering you go through in training is worth every second of it.

If you can't join the military, find a local MMA gym and sign up for classes. Learn how to get hit in the face, learn the pain of being out of breath with a dude trying to choke you unconscious. MMA gyms are brutal and you'll go home at night feeling like a bitch but what you'll eventually realize is you're doing what 98% of other men are scared to do and that is directly working on becoming TOUGHER and more DANGEROUS.

And obviously HIT THE FUCKING GYM. I can't say this enough. If you're in denial about how effective going to the gym is in regards to RP results, I challenge you to give 9 months of serious effort at the gym and see if you notice a difference in how people treat you.

That's all for today. Thanks for reading :)",1642886743.0
198,Kill Your Inner Beta,73,saemkg,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/saemkg/kill_your_inner_beta/,32,"Rollo Tomassi talks about killing you inner beta.  There are a lot of Red Pill-aware men who don't want to lose their beta mindset and they look at the Red Pill from a beta perspective.  The whole ""she only wants to fuck the Alpha bad boy"" is looking at things from a beta perspective.  If not, her only wanting to fuck the Alpha bad boy would be a good thing for you, am I right?

A man who kills his inner beta can lean towards the Alpha Fucks side of the game.  Instead of getting pissed off at female nature, all of a sudden you're benefiting from it.

""But 80% of the male population are Beta""

So work towards being the other 20%.  You won't believe how little effort you need to be seen as an Alpha in a woman's eyes.  It takes a little training and getting out of your feelings.  I talk about losing the fear of rejection by doing cold approaches.  If you were to just use cold approaching as a tool and not to find your future wife, you would approach hot women anywhere you go while other men are on the sidelines complaining that she's out of their league.  Approach enough hot women and you'll soon land one.  You are out and about with a hot woman, other women see this and become more attracted to you.  You may be out one day and a hot woman approaches you.  She tells you she knows who you are because you were dating her best friend.  Her best friend said good things about you and now she's showing  you choosing signals.  You pick up on these choosing signals and you get her number.  A week later you are fucking this woman.  Being that you are focusing on stacking your money and women are more recreational than being your whole world, you get to take vacations where the weather is warm and the women are hot.  You are sleeping with women who are models.  Not because you have status, but because you happened to approach a hot chick who was a model.

I don't say all this to make you feel like I'm blowing smoke up your ass.  I say this because men who kill their inner Beta get better results with women.  Not because they're deceptive and putting up a facade, but because women are picking up on his Alpha-leaning qualities.

199,How To Set Dating Goals That Actually Get You Laid,85,s9umg5,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s9umg5/how_to_set_dating_goals_that_actually_get_you_laid/,23,"The difference between those who succeed and those who don’t is how they deal with failure.

Everyone has setbacks. But you choose how to interpret those setbacks.

When you binge eat after following a diet for 75 days, you can say,

“The diet was too tough, I can’t do it.”

Or you can say,

“I’m going to start again and follow the diet until I lose 20 pounds. After that I’ll decide whether to make adjustments.”

I change my plans after I reach my goals, not when I face a setback.

Of course, this applies to pickup just like anything else.

Most guys give up when they have a few tough rejections and say, “I don’t think I can do this. I’m not good looking enough.”

Instead, I would tell myself, “I’m going out five times per week until I’ve approached 500 women. After I hit that goal, then I can change my plan based on what happened.""

See the difference?

People usually change their goals based on emotions. We all have tough days, it’s easy to give up when we’re feeling overwhelmed.

Instead, make a line in the sand that says you won’t quit until you achieve something difficult—you lose 25 pounds, go on 20 dates, make $1000 with your online business.

Then, once you hit that goal you can change course.

But don’t give yourself an alternative.

You’ll find that once you hit that challenging goal, you’ll want to keep going because you’ve had so many wins along the way.

I strongly recommend that after reading this, you make a commitment to yourself about pickup.

Tell yourself, “I’m going to go out x amount of times per week until I achieve y.” And if I fail, I will start from the beginning.

You can keep it simple, “I’ll go out every day for at least 15 minutes until I’ve gone out 30 days in a row.”

Or it could be, “I’ll go out 5 times per week until I get 10 dates with women.”

Then, if on one week you don’t go out 5 times, you start over from the beginning.

And there’s no alternative. If you fail, you start over.

Until eventually, you succeed.

Then, once you’ve achieved your goal, you are allowed to make adjustments.

This is the method that allowed me to create an online business that makes me over 15k a month while only working an average of 10 hours per week.

Apply it to pickup. Apply it to your other goals.

All I ask is you send me your success story via DM when you have one.",1642827651.0

\-John Dillinger

I had a lot of requests and folks in the community wanting to know the backstory to yesterday’s post. So, here it is. Less victim puke-y and more reflective. I wasn’t completely stupid/ignorant, just weak and lonely. So forgive the long read.

We met, dated, all the usual crap. Met her on OLD (I have a whole soap box about this cancerous system) and things were good. She checked most boxes and such. Granted I didn’t vet her and wasn’t anywhere near RP as I am today. So I was over here making fucked up BP decisions. When I was a child, I wanted nothing more than a family. Mine was garbage, abusive dad, ignorant whore mother, shit… they even managed to turn my younger brother into giga-Billy. I, just wanted my own to do right. Raise a son with dignity, strength, truth, to build a legacy. To defy my destiny, to break the fucking cycle. Jesus was I fucking idiot.

There were some issues I was trying to work with, like cleaning. Her place was dirty and I didn’t like it. I was texting a friend about the situation and asking advice on how to address the topic. I text about how relationships are dumb, how do you tell someone they don’t clean to your standards? Like “bitch pick up a broom!”? Anyways, the decision I made was to offer to help clean her house to set a standard. Before I brought this up to her, she went through my phone the night prior and somehow came to the conclusion I said she was “A dirty alcoholic bitch”, and because of this she had to go out behind my back and fuck randoms as my punishment (I guess? Or perhaps she needed validation I refused to give?). I was none the wiser, but she cleaned the fucking shit out of her house.

Initially things were bomb. She spoiled me, bought me shit, for fuck sake this woman flew my ass out to Maui. Things changed quick though and I remember the exact day. My lease was up at my apartment, and she was pushing for me to move in with her in her house (Mommy and Step-Daddy have money, and she made good money). I postponed this for about 6 months and finally gave in. The week after I moved in, I saw the switch. Her attitude changed, just like the thousands of post you read here.

Fast forward a bit, and I was laid off from my job. We spoke and I was 1.5 years from my degree so she gave me the spill of “Babe, I’ll hold us down!”. Being the fucking idiot I was, I took the bait. Hook… line… and suckered…. (Why is this bad, because I unknowingly relinquished my power to her). Anyways this was the beginning of some next level fucked up shit. Verbal abuse, fucking other dudes, humiliating and emasculating remarks, and I put myself in a situation where I was relying on her. FUCKING DUMB.

Anyways, as shit progressed I keep doing dumb shit. Like throwing loads into my whore GFs pussy… which led to creating a life. This was the beginning of my true RP awakening.

Her being pregnant was everything. I was pumped, well on my autistic mission to raise another fool in today's society. However… 20 weeks in we went to find the sex. It was a boy! I literally cried tears of joy, I would have the opportunity to be the father my father never was. To show, to build, to support, everything you imagine when you think of a father and son. My mission had started for real now. As the Ex and I took the few minutes to celebrate the doctor came in (Not nurse) and explained that our son had a genetic anomaly and would die before birth. I couldn’t hear anything… the world went mute.

After long discussions, fighting, arguing, threatening, and God knows what else… I talked my wife out of an abortion. Why? Because I couldn’t live with myself if I just stood by and allowed my blood to be extinguished by idiots who have no value in life. Plus, what does that say about her? A woman so willing to scrap your child out of her womb, like it’s some fucking blood clot she decided to pass? Fuck you, fuck that. I argued with her, doctors, her parents, all of them and I wouldn’t change this decision for anything in the world.

Now, when he was born it was rough. He spent 8 months in ICU, needed a ventilator, 24 hour care, and much much more. I couldn’t shake this feeling that she was fucking around, and finally got my hands on proof and confronted her. My son was only 2 months old at the time, and I found out about her fucking other dudes. She went as far as to try to get me to be friends with one dude she fucked without me knowing they were smashing. That’s how fucking malevolent women can be. I dipped harder than the crypto market after a tweet from Elon. Gone.

Few months later she reaches out, and talked my stupid ass into trying to get it fixed for our son’s sake. I did it, but by now I had consumed more RP content than stomach. I decided to be there for my son hell or high water, but she needed her ass checked. So I gave stipulations (like every idiot does when he thinks he’s going to get a whore to behave) and came back.

The next six months were great. We played family, took care of our son, doctors trips together, honestly I loved it. I knew deep in the back of my mind the reality of the situation, but escapism is real and tempting. Anyways, I saw her fucking around with her old phone one time and the thought hit me. Clone her phone, and stay one step ahead of her. This was the single intelligent move I made.

This was fucking disgusting. Hitting up dudes to come fuck, sexting, shit talking me, next level shit. She gave the password to the camera used to monitor our son to some stranger in South America. This is when I decided to go nuclear.

After finding out all this, I played it cool and stupid (not hard for me apparently). I called her out on a text she got, and caught her in another lie. So… I decided to spin plates and do better. I spent the next 8-12 months working out, eating right, building, growing, and crushing what I could. This is also where I developed true outcome independence. She did everything she could to sabotage my growth. She baked brownies and sweets, would try to get me to skip the gym with sex, ect.

I went to the bar one night, wearing my ring and all, all by my lonesome. And wouldn’t you know… a 23 year old softball player, redhead, is there and is eating up the game I throw at her. As I gamed more, and fucked other chicks as time went on, the distance showed in the marriage. She knew something was up but couldn’t figure it out. Nothing made me feel better than knowing she was tasting the pussy of a woman who just fucked me hours ago, as she sucked me off. Why? Because I know she did me that way.

Skipping the pointless shit we’ll get to the highlights of hell. We played a phone game together for a while to help pass time at the hospitals. We were there pretty regularly for our son and his stays. Turns out when I stopped playing the game, she met some dude on there. He was younger, and lived overseas in the UK. She still didn’t know I could see her messages, but shit was wild. She talked about poisoning me, told him I had a micro dick, that she was luckily drunk every time we fucked, and crazy ass shit. I couldn’t stand it, so I gathered evidence, saved it, and then left for the night to fuck a side chick.

The next day she decided she was done. Started filing for divorce. Luckily, I still had the phone cloned and could see her strategy. She lied to me saying we’d be amicable for our son’s sake, but in the back channel her mom was giving her advice on how to take me for Child support, alimony, and anything I had. This gave her the entitlement she needed to try to do more damage to me. She began face-timing other dudes in front of me. She would drop little shitty hints to let me know she’s fucking around.

She went as far as to start sending money and gifts to the guy in the UK. She fell madly in love in this dude, and even bought him a FUCKING RING! We ain’t even divorced yet, and she’s out here trying to cuff some dude thousands of miles away? Da fuq….? She sent emails to jobs in the UK looking for sponsorship… How in the fuck was she going to have custody of our son who CAN NOT TRAVEL! How the hell did she think he was going to move to the UK? I saw the naked pictures they shared, the stupid fucking games they played with each other, I even had the pleasure of listening to them chat when they thought I wasn’t around.

Anyways, turned out our son was having issues and needed to be back in the hospital. While there the doctors ignored what I told them and failed to check on him. He spiked a fever of 109, and basically was brain dead. He was suffering seizures now, was stiff, had lost all progress he had made in two years, and would now need even more medication. What quality of life he had, was gone.

I made the decision to take him off support. However, both parents must agree. She wanted to wait a month or two to “see if there’s change” Regardless his brain was now just black matter on the scans. It took her UK boyfriend talking her into it, but she finally agreed. The day we took him off the support, I walked into the room and she was laying on the coach next to our son, who was dying, face-timing this guy. This woman, let a fucking stranger into the most intimate moment I’ll ever have in my life.

After he died, I left for two weeks to try to get my head strait. Luckily I buried him on my family’s property, he was my blood and a fighter. If any man deserved to be buried in the roots of my family, it was my son. When I came back home, I found a plan B in the trash, lots of empty bottles, and I wont even go into the what I saw on the phone. She had fucked her co-worker. Good to see things don’t change, right?

Anyways we got drunk and settled the divorce on our own. Uncontested. Split things up, gave some money, and what was done was done. Signed the papers and moved on.

My last day there, she couldn’t even let me have peace. She brought her boss’s brother over. He was smashed and fucked up. This is a whole other long cringe worthy story of how fucking ignorant women do shit for attention. Regardless, this dude used my fishing pole! SHE TOOK HIM FISHING WITH MY SHIT! Nothing is sacred with a woman… she even thanked me for teaching her to fish, because home boy was “too city boy” and couldn’t fish. Anyways, she had to bring this dude around the last day I was there… Jokes on her because he got arrested that night, lol.

Anyways, this was my journey. There’s lots missing that I could include but this is already too long. You're free to believe it or not, but I'll gladly give receipts if you need the stupid shaken out of you.

NO MARRIAGE

[Disclaimer: This is just a piece of fluff meant to inspire you. There is no guidance and no how-to in here.]

You have woken up without an alarm clock - for the 100th day in a row. 

It is still early in the day, and yet you get out of bed without having to force yourself. You pull back the curtains, instantly getting greeted by south-eastern tropical sun and an amazing view of the ocean. 

These days you have awoken to so many beautiful views, but they still have not lost their appeal to you. Briefly, you are toying with the idea of eventually acquiring your own place - but right now are perfectly content with staying at top tier hotels for a fraction of what your rent used to cost you in the soulless second-tier city you used to call home.

Since you are operating on several hours of a time difference, everyone in the old world is still asleep.

You throw on some gym clothes and you ride the elevator to the gym in the 9th floor. You are the only person here. You decide to blast some music while getting your reps in. Now, hotel gyms are rarely catering to an audience of avid iron enthusiasts, but you have learned to make do with what is available. You are no stranger to cranking out a hundred burpees and pushups, if all else fails.

To cool down and round off your workout, you head to the pool. Again, no one but you and the hotel staff is up and awake yet. By now they are used to the sight of you tearing throw the water like you are getting paid for it.

Eventually, you come back to your room. You get dressed and begin planning your day, zero-ing your inbox and picking up any leftover loose strands from the day before. The old world is still asleep, but the town below your balcony begins bustling to life.

Like clockwork, hunger begins to set in. You head downstairs and out onto the streets. Dressed in light cotton clothes, you feel a warm breeze caress your body - still pristine and unsullied by the smell of exhaust fumes, burning coal and tourist deodorant. 

Speaking of tourists: By this time you can reliably tell them from the „regulars“. They seem like an alien species to you - their sweaty and confused gazes being so unlike the calm you carry both in your heart and on your face.

Even though the peddlers have learned to ignore you by now, you decide to duck into an alleyway, taking a shortcut trough the maze-like backstreets. 

A cat is lazily resting in the shadow of wonkily assembled brick wall. There really is not telling the strays from the pets - the felines in this area really seem to belong to anyone and everyone. You scratch it behind the ear and continue on your way.

You eventually arrive at your destination. Even if you did not know this town like your back pocket, your nose would have reliably led you here. 

Enveloped in a cloud of spices and aromas, your appetite reaches its peak. You order an assortment of produce and protein, paying a laughably low amount of money, all while making small talk with kind elderly owner of the the street food booth.

You‘d think that the conversation would somehow evolve, now that you have picked up some bits of the local language - but you have come to understand that most of it repeats. It is a ritual, a social lubricant, a medium to express mutual friendlines respect. It is mostly about the weather, your plans for the day or her trying to set you up with her daughter.

After some banter, you politely decline and continue on your way, eventually arriving at the beach.

You scan the surroundings through the tinted plastic of your sunglasses. Ironically, by now your method has grown eerily similar to those of the peddlers, who are trying to sell overpriced oranges to the inexperienced new-arrivals.

Eventually, you spot something - or rather: someone - of interest. Slim frame, brunette with just enough of an outline of trim muscles outlining under her pre-tanned skin. From the slightly tacky summer dress she just dropped on her towel, you‘d guess Russian or at the very least eastern European. 

You walk up to in what has become your tried and tested routine. „Excuse me, could you watch my stuff while I go for swim?“ After a millisecond of bewilderment and another millisecond of sizing up your entire existence from a quick glance, she eventually nods. „Sure.“ You your „stuff“, a towel and a burner phone, into the sand. Then, with measured confidence, you proceed to take of your shirt, inch by inch revealing your chiseled body. 

You almost could not tell because of her sun-glasses, but the slight wrinkles on her forehead and the surpressed upwards-motion of her eye-brows betray the double-take she just took. You shoot her a friendly smile and walk off towards the waves.

The water is perfect. Even better than the hotel pool. And with the pandemic still locking most of the world’s population at home to the sound of Netflix binges and their own neurosises, you don‘t even have to share.

You take a quick glance at your dive watch to judge the time and then proceed to exert yourself against the rising tide. You swim all the way to a bouncing yellow buoy and then make your way back - this time with the currents in your favor. As you arrive back on the beach, another glance at your watch proves satisfactory - you have improved your time again.

Like Daniel Craig you walk out of the shallow water, making your way back to your skinny soviet beach bunny. She has taken off both her sunglasses and her defensive attitude now - exchanging both for a much more pleasant demeanor. 

Conversing with her is like riding a bike. You have done it countless time before, breezing through the usual topics like „What‘s your name?“, „Where are you from?“ and „How long are you staying“.
You keep your answers intentionally vague, relying entirely on your friendly and relaxed attitude to carry the conversation. There is no need to impress her, or to force the interaction along. It just happens.

After about 20 minutes she gives you her phone number. 5 Minutes later you have set up a date for the evening. 

Eventually, you excuse yourself and make your way back to the hotel. The mid-day sun starts burning excessively and your long for climate controlled surroundings.

You arrive back at your room, take a quick shower and then open your laptop. The old world has awoken. You join the daily stand-up or weekly kick-off or some other bullshit zoom call, looking into tired, sunken in faces of the corporate drones that now spend their third summer in lockdown. 

You do you best to keep your background neutral so no-one knows where you are. Since you are a freelancer, no one can really tell you how to do your job anyway - but you are wise enough not to provide fuel for jealousy nor anger. 

You get off the call and start working on your tasks for the day. Finishing them takes you about 3-4 hours. It never seizes to amaze your how fast you can now accomplish what used to take an eight hour workday. Instead of „playing work“ half of the day, nowadays you just sit down and power through all of it in one sitting. 

You close your laptop just in time for dusk. You make your way down to the streets again an hop on your motorbike to take a ride and clear your head.

After brushing aside your thoughts about work, investments or your upcoming date, you eventually reach another, deeper thought has been your steady companion for those past few months.

It is warm and calm and rich with gratitude.

202,Lessons Learned from walking through Hell,420,s8m7vk,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s8m7vk/lessons_learned_from_walking_through_hell/,82," Hello brothers,

I’m not sure any of you may remember me or my story. It’s been almost two years since sharing or posting. I was the guy who’s shit show of a marriage came to an end when my special needs son died. He spiked a fever of 109 degrees and cooked his brain. We took him off life support, all while my wife was too busy being a whore and fucking around during this time. It was the worst time of my life, but thanks to a lot of what I’ve learned here I’ve emerged from the fires of hell more refined. I want to give back and share some of the foundational learnings and lessons I’ve had along the way. 

**No one cares**

Let’s start here. This was the harshest of realities given the situation. None of my friends checked in on me, my job didn’t give a fuck, even family bailed on me. For example, my mother told me taking my son off life support was “euthanasia”. This was a wild lesson for me to learn, because I assure you it cut deep. In general people care more about their lunch than anything that might resemble a struggle in your life. The lesson here, is there is a why behind STFU. You STFU because nobody cares, and because no one cares complaining it pointless. 

**The Volume is turned Down**

After burying my son, it felt like the volume was turned down in life. People would complain about things, and I would always think to myself “These people have no fucking clue what problems are”. They have no clue of the value of their own time, time with children or relationships, and are honestly just pretending to be socialites. The world is filled with so much pointless audio clutter you often get lost in it, and forget to ground yourself and focus on what’s real and present. The lesson here, the world is loud. Ignore it and focus on what’s important to you. The rest will be there… making that same fucking noise. 

**Blue-Pill Habits**

This is honestly what hurt me the worst. Prior to my son dying I was literally on my ascension to God-hood. My money was getting right, I took care of my son better than the doctors, I fucked my whore of a wife, I fucked other women, I was getting more ripped by the day, and I was a fucking ROCK in my mentality. However, burying my son nuked everything. I lost my identity, my mission, my purpose, my health (Lost 40lbs in less than a year), became depressed, and basically picked up every shit coping method I’d ever learned in my life. All of this was nothing more than a cycle of depression feeding itself. The lesson here, you know what habits are detrimental to yourself. Identify them and FUCKING STOP IT.

**Women**

Now, I won’t lie to you guys. Given my circumstances, if I decided to share with a woman about what happened it was cat-nip. Women assume they can fix you (if you’re attractive). I fell into a relationship with one of the women I was fucking prior to the divorce. She was one of the few in my life that showed me kindness and empathy through the storm. However, the truth is she wanted to change me. Change me into someone I’m not. Shame me into doing handyman stuff at a house I don’t even live. To guilt me for not committing as much as I had in the past to other women. Name calling to tear down self-esteem to ensure they keep you in your lane. She tried to play the long game here, but unfortunately, I saw the writing on the wall. The lesson here, is AWALT. They will be solipsistic even at most down and out. If they see a chance to scoop up a “good dude” they will literally do anything to make it happen.

**Spinning Plates**

Easiest thing to do when you realize the basics and don’t over think shit. These women today are more thirsty than you are. I literally fucked a “lesbian” in the ass because she was having problems with her girlfriend. Shit has never been this easy. They say fly shit, thinking their slick waiting… LITERALLY WAITING for your to check their ass. Frame is everything, check their ass and then destroy her ass. Lesson here, be attractive and don’t give a fuck. 

**Gym**

This is the most important part of everything involving TRP/MRP. The iron temple, the place you get to praise yourself with the blood and tears. To grow physically, as well as mentally. Working out sucks, it’s hard. A lot of the stuff is heavy, and it takes a lot of effort to pick those stupid things up only to set it back down. However, the benefits are so stupid there’s no argument to be made. Mental health is associated with physical health, as above so below. It helps with hormones, confidence, mental health, and literally makes you sexier and stronger. Most men don’t work out, and if they do, they’re fucking around in there playing with their dicks or something. I’ve had more woman check me out, compliment me, beg to fuck me, and do dirty things all because I have the discipline to go to the gym. The lesson here, just go to the god damn gym and stop fucking around. This is the first building block to being a stronger version of yourself. 

This isn’t anything amazing, but this is just some of the lessons I learned from trying to escape my personal hell. I hope some of you find this useful, probably not. I hope you men are out here protecting your peace and mental health. Strange times we’re in, enjoy the decline.


EDIT: Bonus life advice for the young men here.

Pregnancy and Paternity 

ALWAYS GET A DNA TEST! ALWAYS! You ignore that woman's fucking mouth noises and test. Girlfriend, ONS, Wife, sister, whoever! You do not sign that birth certificate until you fucking know 100%. Not a single fucking person here has the time to lay out HOW MUCH YOU FUCK YOURSELF if you dont take these precautions. There is nothing any woman on earth can give or do for you that will be worth this peace of mind.

Updated edit-5/10/22 I am a little bit less retard because of brother hamza

First This helps me from going sexless for 3 years to now I have 6 bodies it ain't much but it's honest work. This also help with the tinder picture I went from 1 match per week to 30 matches every two weeks.

Disclaimer: I'm not the sharpest knife in the Cray box but look at my profile(my before and after picture) and my profile picture as you can see I'm not the biggest guy but I got some muscle and I got a sixpack so I know little something about what I'm talking about.

If you are skinny fat or want more muscle to take a step in. Also, this may not work for everyone

NOW LET'S DIVE ON IN

1. Working Out

Down below is my workout plan. I do a Push/Pull/Leg workout routine.5-6 days a week for 5-6 different workouts 3-4 sets for 8-12 reps. Push day is Monday, Pull is Tuesday, legs Wednesday, rest Thursday then starting over again. If you don't have time like that it's fine because any workout is better than none.

Push Day

bench press for shoulders/Dumbbell press(laying on back)

Bench press for chest/ Dumbbell press(sitting at n angle)

standing dumbbell shoulder press/barbell press(standing straight)

standing dumbbell fly front and to the side

skull crushers

cable flys

Pull Day

weighted pull-ups front/side/back grip do as much as you can for 3 sets for each grip and your good weighted or unweighted

Dumbbell or barbell curl

Barbell rowers

Narrow and wide cable rows

Leg Day

squats

deadlift

weighted heel ups

leg curls

legs press

Abs

Look up Brandon carter's abs workout do for 20-30 on workout days here's his channel: [Brandon Carter - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/HighLifeWorkout).I would try to workout abs every day because I would often forget to do abs and I would rather overtrain my abs than under-training them.

Neck(yes the neck)

Neck extensions with a weighted ball for 3 sets for as many reps as you can. Here's a video from Adonisss himself on why it's important to work out your neck:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWZaNm4HDX8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWZaNm4HDX8) I've had people come toward me and tell me I got a bigger neck without me even bringing anything up to about my neck.

2. Diet/Protein

The next thing you need to do is find out how many calories you need to bulk. The next link is for your tree calculator: [TDEE Calculator: Learn Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure](https://tdeecalculator.net/)

For bulk, you will need to increase your daily calories by 250-500 more carioles daily

The goal you should be to reach is 1-2 pounds gained every single week.4-8 pounds every single month(2 pounds a week is for the people who look like they have malnutrition

For me right now I'm 176 and I'm bulking to 215 by next year. My personal goal every single week is around 1.2 pound gain. And once I get to my goal ill maintain it for around 6 months then cut it to 200.

Protein is the most important Marco that you will need. I suggest 1g of protein per 1pd. So I weigh 176 I try to eat a minimum of 176 protein daily(I would do more but protein is expensive asf so I put a guide for cheap protein.)

1 Egg=7g protein

60 eggs from food loin are 5-6 bucks

1 tbsp Peanut butter=3.2g of protein

peanut butter jar is 4-6 bucks

2 scoops of protein powder=60g of protein

protein powder off amazon cost 40-60 bucks

This is a monthly total of 80-120 bucks(It takes money to build your body.

Creatine will help you gain weight and speed up your recovery time.

Take 5g of creatine for 28 days then take 5g every day to keep the effects

OR

Take 20g of creatine for 7 days then take 5g every day to keep the effects(I like loading like this more both work though)

1 scoop creatine=5g

200 scoop jar is worth 30 bucks on amazon

3. The Last important things you need

A notebook to track calories, weight, workouts, etc.

A scale to weigh yourself

AND THE LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT THING

CONSISTENCY

If you are not consistent then none of this will work.2 years will pass anyways either you could look better or be in the same place reading the same thing over and over.

TDLR: Go back up and read the rest dude, you know that you don't get anything from the TDLR. And if you are a mod pls don't delete the post and if you do at least give me a reason why you did it. To shit took me a while to research and write.

Below is a link for the body transformation I did. (You don't need to click the link and if you just read the TLDR do not click this link. This is for people who like watching videos and listening more. [https://youtu.be/xlFj-hAlHwc](https://youtu.be/xlFj-hAlHwc)

Now This needs to be said the main reason I have written this post is so you do as the title says build more muscle to get laid. Thou it may seem like a shitty goal it's okay to have simple goals to get to where you want to. I started working out because I wanted to get girls but now it's improved every single part of my life.

Thank you for reading and please start working out because for me without the red pill and working out I wouldn't be here today because of how depressed I was before it. I wish you luck and Godspeed.",1642691194.0

Lets look at ol' John Fapsalot. John lifts. He collects a decent paycheck. John is dedicated to his job.

John cold approaches at least half a dozen women a day and gets rejected or blown out consistently. 

He's confused. 

""What the fuck is wrong"", he wonders. He lifts.  He's cut. He has a decent car and a nice house. He spends most of his time in the office. 

John goes out and asks women questions that he got from a PUA bootcamp. He feels comfortable with his job interview approach. 

Lets ask yourself gentlemen, when you think of job interviews, do you think ,""Wow! what a a rip-roaring time! I can't wait to attend this interview! What fun""! 

I would hope not. 

This isn't fun. Don't make a date a job interview. Don't make your activities predictable and boring. If you're in an amusement park and one ride looks really dull and uneventful are you going to be drawn to that ride, or will you get in line for something else? 

I ask people all the time: what do you do with your free time. Most will say ,""I dunno. Not much. I guess going and doing things or watching TV. Sometimes I like nature"". 

My eyes will usually glaze over as my brain checks out. How does this sound even remotely appealing? Does this sound like the type of life that women will throw themselves at? Or is it more of a life that will make a woman want to throw herself off a cliff? 

Guys, if you cant make yourself happy and keep yourself entertained, a woman won't feel like you have enough excitement to spare for her. 

Back in the day, Musicgoon was very fat (but handsome). I had a lot of shortcomings, but women loved spending time with me. There was one thing that they would say. Musicgoon is so fun! We always do exciting stuff! 

Now, this exciting stuff was *for me*. If she wanted to join, cool. The train was leaving either way. She just had an invitation to ride. 

Make sure to make your fun a priority over your dating success. Stop being boring and your dates will rave about how fun it is to be with you.",1642620498.0

Rupert's parents didnt only burden him with a limp name, they were overbearing products of modern feminsm. Their parental approach was to raise Rupert in a way that would reflect well on them. 

Forget that Rupert would grow up to be his own man one day and nuture that journey, his parents strived to make sure he served society well, above all else.

Rupert was told that men with muscles end up in jail. But even worse....like the libtard teachers of today, that tell boys to become girls before their first hard on, Rupert's parents ingrained a belief system (their belief) that would take a monumental effort to shake later in life.

This goal is that he should earn the privilege of a monogamous relationship with a nice girl who is ready to settle down, after being successful in his career. Just like his old man did.

Rupert approached life with a paint by numbers approach. He always stayed between the lines and done what was expected of him, putting other peoples oppinions before his own. As someone who never stood up for himself, this was easier. Going against the grain and confrontation became his biggest fears.

School and college passed without incident. He obtained good grades but the only praise he ever received from another human was from teachers and colleagues that used him. 'He was such a nice lad' they said before forgetting he existed forever. He left a kissless virgin. 

He watched other people develop lifestyles based on their own values and form groups based on interests they explored. Whether it was sports, travelling, camping, music or adopting trends that surfaced, Rupert rationalised this all as a lack of individuality while displaying none of his own. He was the invisible one.

More importantly without pursuing any passions, activities or finding common ground, he was never accepted into a tribe of boys/men and remained isolated.

He landed a job in middle management and has even gone on a few dates with women but all he had to describe himself by, is his job role, duties and netflix history. He still does as his parents tell him. He remains a virgin. To make matters worse, he is now having heart issues after getting the v@x because of parental pressure, despite having suspicions and being healthy.







So whats the point in this story:

There are countless boys being brought up this way and the next generation will be even worse.

Some of you may have started from a similar position or you may still be that guy. It may remind you of someone you know. You may have even helped raise someone out of such a position.

There are even men that put on muscle and tell themselves, 'you're the prize' but are boring cunts.

You actually need to go out and do shit and have shit to talk about, for men and women, to notice you and bond with you.

As for women, there was a good post the other day on the reasons women have sex that is relative to this.

Its not a suprise to anyone that most virgins are boring as fuck. Even handsome buff lads repel women if theyre boring or awkward.

One thing i have seen throught my life is how women  have sex with someone that provides an experience or is certain archetype that strikes their mood at that time.

You can be a drummer, a drug dealer, guy who throws parties, a particular race (forbidden fruit), a football player, someone who races, a boxer, dance teacher, an artist, a magician, a skateboarder. You could even be a harry potter quiz master and girls that like it will enter that world. 

It can even take something as a quarterback dumping a girl, for that girl to swap worlds and go for a drumer next. Know what they wont do, sleep with a boring man who doesnt know what he likes and cant offer an experience.

Women enter a mans world after hes created it or while hes creating it. She needs a story to tell their friends because god forbid they are the boring one of the group or that the man she is fucking doesnt generate feelz. A girl can also choose to find a new man, simply because their bff is having new experiences.

Hell...you only need to give the perception that you're a certain type/exciting to get someone curious about you. So long as you can be congruent. I know lads that were boring as fuck that got tattoo sleeves just because it was in fashion. All of a sudden women perceive them as badass and a type they can gossip about. Yeah they might attract a different type of girl but they didnt attract anything before.

Im not saying become something you're not, or getting ink, especially for women. But if you hesitate to pursue what you want out of fear of rejection or shame, chances are you'll have nothing to offer but a boring world and will be invisible to most people.

Remember shame and guilt are feminist tools to shit test men in beta mode, while the alpha's push through and create their own naratives and experiences that both men and women want to be apart of.

If you let anyone (especially parents controlling their adult offspring) shit test you out of something you want to do or be, a hobby, style of fashion, life choice, way to make a living, even kinks, you'll be nothing but an NPC living in a world that isnt your own. It can even cost you your life.",1642624599.0
206,"Stop Doing: With Women, Less Is Always More",258,s7cb5z,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s7cb5z/stop_doing_with_women_less_is_always_more/,38,"Good afternoon RP.

Today I wanted to break down the process of dating and explain why less is always more when it comes to the art of seduction.

Many men on here have given feedback asking for more help on how to ""be"" with women, so I hope these concepts will help those of you who are trying to figure it out, or trying to understand where you're going wrong.  After a while, you will begin to get a ""feel"" for this, the same way you learn to ride a bike.  Get on the bike, try to ride a few feet, fall down, get back up, and repeat.  The same goes for learning how to talk to women, and ""being"" with them.  It's weird at first, and then you get the hang of it.  You become a guy who ""is"" good with women.

1. **Stop Talking** \- Want to know a universal truth that will completely change your relationships with everybody, never mind just women?  Learn to shut the fuck up and listen, and listen intently.  There is nothing on this planet that anybody wants to talk about more than themselves and what they're interested in.  Especially women.  There is nothing a woman on a date loves more than talking about herself.  This dynamic is a win-win for you because by allowing her to talk, you're making her to do all the work of QUALIFYING HERSELF while you yourself are still a mystery whose intentions and feelings are unclear, which is a HUGE PART OF WHAT SPIKES A WOMAN'S ATTRACTION LEVELS.  You are learning who she is by allowing her to talk and in contrast, she knows little to nothing about you.  This also provides a framework for men who are introverted or awkward to prevent themselves from fucking things up by talking their way out of bed with a woman by saying stupid shit.  If you create an environment where a woman can talk about herself, you are creating an environment where you will get laid.
2. **Stay off the phone** \- One of the most common mistakes men make after getting a girl's number is immediately texting her that night or the next day and saying some dumb shit like ""I had a great night last night.""  If you had a great night last night and you're not a complete autist, you can trust that she probably had a good night as well.  When you reach out that night or the next day, all it shows a woman is that you have absolutely fuck all going on, and you're more than happy to latch onto a complete stranger in hopes your warm gooey feelings are validated because you don't have enough confidence in yourself to keep it real and say ""Maybe that was something, maybe it wasn't.  Either way, all good.""  Understand, this is the reality women face 99% of the time.  They go out, some guy comes up to her, buys her drinks, they hit it off, she gives her number to him, they part ways, and IMMEDIATELY this dude starts acting like she is his One-True-Love by talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking, simply because she talked to him while she was buzzing and gave him her number.  So imagine the fresh air it must be when a dude gets her number, waits a few days, and then calls her or texts and asks when she is free, sets up a date, and then doesn't say another word until they are in person.  It's DIFFERENT.  It's EXCITING.  It's MYSTERIOUS.  Who the fuck has the confidence to do some shit like that?  Somebody who doesn't need validation if the date doesn't end up working out.  
3. **Stop wasting your time** \- Two of the most frustrating things guys new to game run into are trying to force an interaction with a woman who has little to no interest in them, and the inevitable hot/cold scenario where a woman who at first really seemed into them suddenly stops calling, texting, and bailing on dates.  This is why it's so important to learn how to shut up and actively pay attention to women you are approaching and dating.  They will make it pretty obvious for you whether they want to talk to you or not, and you can use this as a barometer of where their attraction for you is.  What most men get wrong is trying to force interactions with women when there simply isn't anything there for them.  These moments are always kind of awkward and the idea of simply walking away without saying anything else once you realize she's not into you simply doesn't appear in the list of options most men have.  Once you understand that approaching women isn't about TRYING TO GET A WOMAN TO LIKE YOU, but rather FINDING OUT IF THEY COULD LIKE YOU, you can save yourself a lot of time by learning to walk away when the conversation isn't fun and easy for you.  The same goes for the hot/cold women.  Say you get a girl's number, wait a few days to hit her up, set a date, stay off the phone and then she calls you the day of to tell you she can't make it.  If you're experienced enough to understand a test when you see one, you can simply say ""I'll be at such and such at 8pm like we talked about."" and just leave it at that.  No further explanation needed.  If she shows up or asks if you're going to pick her up first, you know it was just a test.  If she doesn't, her attraction for you wasn't that high and chances are it'd be more work than it's worth to continue that line of dialogue.  As I talked about in my previous article, go NO CONTACT and simply disappear.  If there was some attraction left, there is a small chance she might reach out later down the road.  

These three things should help you to get started when it comes to the process of dating.  With women, you want to be scarce at first and slowly, over a series of months, start giving her more of your time as her feelings for you become stronger and more undeniable.  The best way to not fuck things up is to let them do the talking, with you asking questions which allow her to elaborate further.  Keep your conversations about yourself to a minimum and don't take it personally if it doesn't work out.  Stay off the phone, stop texting your life story, and LET HER IMAGINATION DO THE HARD WORK FOR YOU.  Women will fill in the blanks with things they love, and the small amounts of things they do earn from you will be much more valuable to her than the dude who tells his whole life story the day after they met at a bar.",1642551483.0
207,My Experiences Working At One Of The Most Red Pilling Jobs On Earth.,669,s53gdc,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s53gdc/my_experiences_working_at_one_of_the_most_red/,112,"This is a long one, and don't mind my grammar errors as some had complained of it in my other posts. English is not my mother tongue. 

Back when I was 18 and fresh out of high school, I had randomly met this person at the mall. You know, just casually. We had a good conversation, and this guy to me seemed pretty based. Turns out, he actually owned a very high end club near where I lived at the time, and asked me to join and bartend because he liked my communication skills. Where I live, you can legally serve alcohol when you're 18. At this time, I wasn't ""red pilled"" at all. I had a classic case of oneitis which I really couldn't get over (high school things) and she had cheated on me, because I was just too open and honest with her.  Basically I had no game, was too genuine and frank. Thinking back now, I was dumb and in a delusional fantasy world of where, ""I'll marry this unicorn and live happily ever after."" After breaking up with her, I somewhat had ""woken up"" to female nature, but I hadn't fully yet. But working at the club changed my life forever, and for the better.



Coming from a blue pill world, I was completely SHOCKED in my first couple weeks of working there. I just couldn't handle it. There's a myth of men being  ""majority"" of the customers at the club. In my experience, the ratio was pretty balanced and majority of the women who used to come, was for their classic ""girls night out."" So many women I have served alcohol to and overhearing their conversations, one thing I must say, ""Girls only just want to have fun."" Majority of women have no purpose, or mission in life. Majority of what they used to talk about was, either their ""bad boy"" bf who's keeping them on the edge and complaining to their GFS about him, or it was about the guy who they wanted to fuck and their GFS giving their advice on ""how to catch him.""

The funny part is, as much as the fèmìnists say, ""Women want respect and want to be cared for"" that's far from the truth. Women know instinctively, it's only their beauty which will attract a man. Their girlfriends always used to give advices such as, ""show off more of your cleavage or boody girl!"" And things such as this. Women instinctively know, they're only good for sex and they will do such things to ""attract"" a HVM in their eyes. They know their true value, but they act as if they bring so much ""more"" to the table, other than their pussy. That's how they cope with their random feminist ideals.

  As TRP says, ""Women want drama, entertainment, and something to talk about in their lives"" and want that ""emotional rollercoaster"", this is nothing but the truth. Majority of the women that used to come who were fuckable, were always complaining about their boyfriends. Many were regulars, so I used to see them often and overhear their conversations. And it was the same complaining and bitching each time, about how their bfs are ""unreliable and unpredictable"" etc to their girlfriends. While they used to say this, one thing my BP mindset used to tell me was, ""If he's so unreliable and unpredictable and all that, why's she still with him?""

 Now as I know, unreliability/unpredictability and mysteriousness keeps that pussy wet and keeps her on the edge, with that highs and lows of the emotional rollercoaster. None of these women had the boring and reliable ""Beta Billy"" as their boyfriends. All had (because they were young) the stereotypical ""bad boy"" who's unreliable but she still can't get enough of him, and keeps chasing him. Betas bore women and make her pussy drier than the Sahara Desert. Why? Because they're so predictable and just plain boring. They have nothing interesting or entertaining going on in their lives. Girls just wanna have fun, and need that consistent drama/entertainment to be on her toes and want to be in a constant ""emotional rush"" which only the ""bad boy"" can provide.


And then oh, also, there were few regular milfs. I think they were in their late 30s or early 40s, married and had kids. And they used to sit at the same table. So as I used to serve them, I used to over hear them complaining about their husbands which we all know as the ""good boy beta billy.""  None of these women were genuinely ""happy"" to be with their husbands. Only trophy wives at best, and were always complaining of how their husband is working 24/7 and not taking them to trips and what not. And how ""he just comes home and sleeps"" or ""how he doesn't give enough time to her"" or ""how he didn't finance the new car and says it's gonna be too much bills"" etc. One thing that bothered me of all this was, these milfs while they're coming to the club and having fun, her husband is working his ass off to keep her ""happy"" and they just never appreciate it. And always only complaining about their husbands. Once you're married, no matter how ""alpha"" or ""red pilled"" you are, over time, you lose ""frame"" especially when the kids come in the picture. You can't give her the ""emotional rollercoaster ride"" 24/7 and over a period of time, it becomes a boring old routine and she will eventually go through her epiphany phase again, of riding the cock carousel just like when she was younger. She wants the ""excitement"" and the drama she had, before marrying the beta buxx. And unfortunately, beta billy will never be able to provide that excitement. Or, she will do the classic, ""I'm not happy"" and screw him over in the divorce courts. The quote that resonates with me a lot from here is, ""She's never yours, it's just your turn."" There is literally no point of marriage for a man in the modern age, especially with these corrupt divorce laws. Marriage is a failed institution, and the divorce statistics don't lie.


The waitresses that worked there, all of them were hot and fuckable. I didn't hit on any of them, but the thing that completely stunned me was the dishwasher was piping down the cocktail waitresses. 🤣🤣 This dude is what you call a typical ""jerk"" with the tattooes and what not. He had a huge physical frame and he had also played college football. Idk why he chose to do a dishwashing job, but he was fast and good at it. And one thing about him I remember, this guy did not give a fuck about whatever anyone taught about him. He said what he wanted, and had that idgaf attitude. I remember once, I was giving some plates to him and the waitress he was piping down was also there. So he goes like, ""I can't wait to do you after work"" and she was blushing and giggling. I had this idea ingrained in my mind that women don't fuck losers or guys like dishwashers, but oh boy, I was wrong.


This just shows, ""She will make rules for the beta, and drop her panties in a flash for an alpha."" The guy who makes that pussy tingle, she will not make him go through all the hoops and hurdles to obtain that pussy, even though he doesn't have money or ""status."" She will signal him, and because he knows how to read those signals, he will be fucking her in no time. While beta billy? He had to make the list and go through all the hoops and hurdles that she had set up for him, only for her to manipulate him with sex and little does he know, he's only her ""safe good boy option."" Also, that real attraction that's supposed to there, is just not there. Majority of the ""alpha widowed"" women, will never in a million years be attracted to their boring beta buxx hubbies. Once she's Alpha windowed, it's over for the guy who marries her.


And oh, also, for the guys who think the waitress is ""flirting"" with them at the club? She's only doing it, so you can tip her more. Overhearing the waitresses talking to themselves, one thing I'll say, majority of these women are hypocrites. Majority of them are swearing their asses off on the customers in the kitchen, while when she goes to hand their food, she has that fake lovey dovey smile and what not, and unfortunately many men fall for it. That smile, or that big cleavage that she's tryna show off, is not because she ""likes"" you. It's only because, you can tip her more and fuck the right off. A lot of these waitresses get hit on constantly, and they know how to manipulate men in getting what they want, and working at these places makes them even more sharper and clever regarding it.

And oh lastly, how can I forget the club fights. I witnessed just too many, and majority of the fights were for 1 reason only. And that was pussy. When the guys got drunk and something happened, or someone said some shit about some chick, Damn. I myself had to call the police once as the guys were going at it like crazy. Some guy's friend revealed to him while he was drunk that, he had slept with his girlfriend before they were together. Then this guy because he was also drunk, just got up and punched him and they went at it, and then their other friends joined in and it was like a brawl in a Ice hockey game where everyone joins in the fun. A scene to be witnessed LOL. Why? Just because over a piece of pussy. The chick wasn't even there. The guys did good amount of damage to the tables and what not, and I think they paid a huge fine. But this is what happens, when you take pussy too seriously. If that guy was red pilled, he would have known, ""She's never yours, it's just your turn"" and would have remained stoic and used her only as a plate. But unfortunately, we have guys killing each other, over fucking pussy. Like what the fuck. That's why, never get overly emotionally invested with any women. It's never worth it in the end.


 After awhile working there, I quit because I was moving away from that area. But that job changed my whole stance on how I view women and marriage and the world in general. The truth set me free. I used to have this blue pill mindset of how, ""I'll marry some unicorn and live happily ever after"" and all that bs, but working there really made me wake up. Then shortly after, I discovered TRP and connected all the dots and it all made sense. There is not one thing I can ever disagree with TRP on, because I have witnessed majority of the things right infront of my eyes. Every saying, and every ""theory"" is indeed correct. RP not only saves lives, but makes you wake the fuck up, to the harsh truth and reality of the world, which society will never teach you. Society wants you to be a loser and dumb, just like any other blue pilled joe out there. I advice all the men, to work at these types of places for the hell of it. I guarantee you, you'll truly wake up and will come out of the blue pilled matrix.

Thanks to all the writers here, who have shared and contributed their golden knowledge and wisdom over the years. Every once so often, every man needs that harsh, but true wake up call when he slips away, and heads towards the delusional fantasy of the blue pill mindset. And this sub indeed, provides that wake up call to get back on track and on your mission.",1642307281.0
208,The Many Reasons Women Have Sex,220,s4tpue,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s4tpue/the_many_reasons_women_have_sex/,60,"Men on the internet seem to think the only reason women have sex is that “you were a 6’4 chad.”

That couldn’t be further from the truth.

Women have sex for countless reasons, and many of them have nothing to do with attraction.

Understanding this will give you an unfair advantage in the dating game and dispel any limiting beliefs you have because you’re not a ‘chad’.

Here’s a list of common reasons women have sex (many are from personal experience, others are from scientific research):

She was talking to another guy that turned her on and it gets transferred onto you.

You remind her of someone she had a crush on when she was younger.

For an ego boost: to feel desirable and attractive (very common in cheating).

She saw that other women were attracted to you and wanted to make sure you wouldn’t go back to them (jealousy).

To gain access to financial advantages (I.E. gold-digging).

She broke up with a guy recently and wants to have sex to help get over it.

Because you’re a “Chad” (good-looking, muscular, tall, etc.)

She consciously decided she wanted to hook up with someone that night and you happened to be the first guy that made a move (this one is much more common than you might want to believe).

Due to guilt (this one is common in long-term relationships where the woman feels obligated to have sex as part of her duties).

Another guy rejected her and she feels undesirable.

Because you were charismatic and she enjoyed being around you.

She was bored and the idea of having sex with you was more entertaining than doing nothing.

To gain power (I.E. you have a skill that she wants access to: you’re a photographer, you have a large social media following, or you have the career she wants to have one day) .

Because you weren’t too physically attractive and you made her feel at ease (whereas a male adonis can be intimidating and uncomfortable to be around).

To get the attention of a high-status man (I.E. hooking up with a rapper because trying to go on a date with him wouldn’t work. Offering sex is a way to be noticed by such men).

Because you put in a lot of effort and she appreciated that (you made her feel desirable).

You and your friend approached her and her friend—she didn’t like you at first, but the other two hit it off so she stayed with you. At the end of the night, she had the choice to do nothing or hookup with you and she thought, “why not?” (this happened to a client of mine recently on his first day of coaching when I invited him to join me on a double date. His girl wasn’t that interested in him, but she still hooked up with him that night.)

To relieve headaches or other physical pain.

To make a guy she likes jealous (I.E., if you don’t commit to me I’ll just hook up with this guy instead).

Because you are a forbidden fruit in some way (I.E. her parents are racist and you’re the race they don’t want her to date).

To deal with feelings of loneliness.

You vaguely resemble a celebrity she has a crush on.

To get exercise.

Because she hasn’t had sex in a while.

She’s a nymphomaniac.

She just left home to go college and wants to let loose now that her parents aren’t judging her every move.

Because of Feminist beliefs: feminism often encourages women to have casual sex sheerly for enjoyment rather than as part of a relationship.

Sex isn’t all about physical attractiveness and pleasure. And even when it is about looks, society’s standards aren’t always relevant.

-Yes, being good-looking to a woman is partially objective: there are traits that are generally more appealing than others.

But it’s also largely subjective: each girl’s culture, background, and experience influence her personal preferences. If a girl fell in love with a short guy when she was in high school, she’s more likely to be attracted to short men in the future.

I still have a preference for olive-skinned dark-haired women because the first girl I fell for had those traits. And chances are, you also have a ‘type’ that was shaped by a celebrity you had strong feelings for or a girl you liked when you were younger.

With that said, it is beneficial to improve your sense of style, grooming, fitness, and financial situation—more women will find you attractive if you do.

But many women will be open to having sex with you regardless of those qualities because there so many reasoning for hookup that have nothing to do with that.

I hope this article gave you useful insights, if there’s a reason women have sex that I didn’t mention, let me know in the comments.",1642279311.0
209,Guy getting gaslit for 16 minutes straight (Breakup video),431,s4jekb,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s4jekb/guy_getting_gaslit_for_16_minutes_straight/,222,"How wonderful is the internet… we can sit behind a screen and study some of the most core concepts in RP, analyze them in detail, rewind and discuss them with others. I’m not saying that sitting behind your screen is all you should do but technology provides us here with a great learning opportunity.

What we have here, are a couple of the most core fundamentals to TRP on full display; on [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY5YSOm8Ixk). This video can serve as a textbook example of concepts discussed on this sub daily: gaslighting, light switch effect, hypergamy & solipsism. 

First I’ll give a little backstory: They have 4 kids, got their first kid when they were 19 (25 now) they have been engaged since 2018. After they had the first kid the guy started busting his ass to provide for the family, working 12hr+ a day etc. You get the picture.

This video was referred to me as being ‘the most painful video you will watch this year’ and after watching it I would add it’s pretty infuriating too. 

The video is titled ‘**We broke up**’ but 15 seconds in it becomes obvious that she broke up with him and it was not mutual. His expression at [0:15](https://youtu.be/UY5YSOm8Ixk?t=15) says more than a thousand words ever will, I think some part of my soul left my body watching that. He’s still in some kind of shock, while she on the other hand (and this is the second thing that becomes obvious) is wayy too giddy for a conversation of this magnitude (they have 4 kids ffs). 

She then goes on to say ([1:30](https://youtu.be/UY5YSOm8Ixk?t=90)) ‘T*he last couple months haven’t been really that bad between us’* but he immediately interrupts her and says it was very rough for him, despite that he saw it coming. He literally says he saw ‘the switch’ happen(!). By this point, to the attentive RP listener it has become obvious that there is with 99.9% certainty already another guy in the picture.

At [2:15](https://youtu.be/UY5YSOm8Ixk?t=135) another great part which will kill you inside a little. She says *‘doesn’t it make you feel better that you weren’t the one who initiated the break up’* and he responds with ‘No, because I tried my ass off to make it work’ and she replies ‘*that’s the thing guys, it doesn’t always work anymore’* (while smiling). I’d bet money she was already getting some on the side.

She then proceeds to say we’ve always been and still are best friends, usual shit.

[3:10](https://youtu.be/UY5YSOm8Ixk?t=190) is another great part, she said there was no drama & no cheating. He then goes on to clarify ‘*You did some things which hurt me and I don’t consider them cheating but there were some lines that should not have been crossed’* hmmm…

Another great line at [4:30](https://youtu.be/UY5YSOm8Ixk?t=270) *‘When I in my head was thinking of you being happy with someone else and that made me happier, that’s when I knew I didn’t want to be with you anymore’*. Next level solipsistic shit. Insane. Way to rationalize/justify leaving him\^2.

Another gem that will crush your soul at [5:10](https://youtu.be/UY5YSOm8Ixk?t=310)

**‘*****I can’t meet your adrenaline standards. I don’t like the things that you like, I don’t want the same things you want and I’m not interested in the same things you are*****.’** They have been together for 7 years and 4 kids together and she says this. What the fuck. If you ever think to yourself ‘what is the light switch effect?’ Remember this. Absolutely fkn crazy. 

He says that he knew at some point something was wrong and felt the distance but he didn’t understand and started to overcompensate (counterproductive if you know some RP) which of course, made her only bitchier.

Women will rarely break up with you out of the blue. It’s usually a slow process of them becoming more and more distant, resentful & bitchy. (Meanwhile they will already be eyeing other guys) This is (subconsciously) all part of sabotaging the relationship to make the eventual breakup easier. 

Now the great part that reinforces the last paragraph at [7:20](https://youtu.be/UY5YSOm8Ixk?t=440). Guy says: *‘It’s crazy though because it feels as if this has been going on since forever but it really only started in late November’* (so 1 month ago) and she responds: *‘I think this is a little bit where we differ,* ***in my mind things have been happening for a year****’*

Video goes on for 7 more minutes but it’s just more gaslighting on her part. She’s obviously already been completelyy checked out of the relationship for a while and already moved on while he hasn’t. Great material to study, especially for relatively new RPers.

Bonus: She encouraged him to go to a strip club ([12:10](https://youtu.be/UY5YSOm8Ixk?t=730)) and to encourage him to sleep with other girls, giving him ‘advice’ etc. (Guess why she would be doing that hmmm..?)

Comments on the video are also golden.",1642250043.0
210,Do you relate to (and enjoy) this story?,90,s3pxc0,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s3pxc0/do_you_relate_to_and_enjoy_this_story/,34,"I wrote a novella about a young mans self improvement / red pill journey. 

I've asked some questions at the bottom of this post if you would like to help me

Here's the first chapter:

&#x200B;

**Chapter 1 - Morning Routine**

*You fucking loser.*

Asif stares at himself in the mirror. His lifeless eyes stationed above dark circles stare back at him, looking like a depressing eclipse. He looks empty, defeated and slumped. He starts his morning routine with his usual negative self-talk....

*I spent all night watching pointless YouTube videos again…*

*Why do you keep doing this?* 

*You made it so clear that that’s a complete waste of time, now it’s 12pm already.*

*The day feels like it’s half over and I just got up.*

*Fuck sake...*

Asif remembers the morning routine YouTube videos he watched for inspiration. All the successful 17 year olds enjoying themselves whilst living in exotic Bali villas, the ones who wake up at 5am to meditate, are circling in his mind, taunting him. He wants that success. He wants the money and the confidence and the 90 day nofap streak and eye contact from girls. He wants six-pack abs just like the guys in the videos and he wants to fuck their attractive girlfriends. 

*They don’t even work that hard.*

It makes him feel better to believe that anyone more successful than him is a product of luck and genetics. Asif snaps out of his daydreaming haze and almost leaves the bathroom without brushing his teeth, but he grabs his toothbrush, lathers on the toothpaste and begins aggressively brushing. He slips back into his usual mindless state...

*I’m tired of all these fucking guys who are so successful.*

*They all make so much money from YouTube and they live such nice lives.*

*What the fuck do I have?*

He spits. There's blood in the spit and that brings him back to the present moment, temporarily. He shrugs his shoulders, returns to his slumped posture and goes straight to his safe space. 

Back at his computer desk, Asif’s muscle memory takes him straight to YouTube.com where he instantly clicks on a self improvement video. He has work to do but this feels productive, for now. Asif keeps his hand on his dirty computer mouse. He doesn’t bother to clean up anymore.

*Oh my god, get to the fucking point and stop wasting my time.*

Constantly clicking forward in the video, skipping 1 minute each time, Asif hopes to find something of value that will change his life. Nothing in this one, onto the next. And the next. And the next. He checks the time and gets frustrated at yet another hour wasted.

*Come on, time to eat.*

Asif doesn’t eat breakfast until a few hours after waking up. He remembers the intermittent fasting videos on YouTube stating that this way of eating is the most effective at burning fat. And he needs to burn fat.

Asif isn’t exactly fat, but he’s not skinny either, and he’s certainly not muscular. He’s skinny fat. He’s cursed with the disadvantages of being skinny coupled with the disadvantages of being fat at the same time. He hates this. He envies the muscular guys who he sees on the YouTube videos getting girls.

*They literally get all the girls.*

*All he has to do is take his shirt off and the girls are all over him...*

*It must be nice to be a Chad.*

He’s in the kitchen, drowning out what his mother says with the negative thoughts in his mind.

*I need to concentrate on my work and she just keeps talking...*

He stays deep in thought whilst his mother goes on and on, giving him advice that he didn’t ask for. He just wants to keep his focus on his work.

Finally, after what felt like an awful long time, his mother has finished preparing his breakfast. She passes the plate to Asif with a smile. 2 fried eggs and 2 slices of toast. Asif’s mother immediately sits down at the kitchen table to continue eating her breakfast that she paused to make his meal. She eats alone. Asif takes his plate to his computer desk so that he can focus on his work. He opens YouTube and begins watching more self improvement videos.

He loves his mom, but he just finds it awkward to express that. Plus, it’s a waste of time to eat at the kitchen table with her when he could be productive and learn whilst eating at his desk. He begins to eat.

*She didn’t even put enough butter on the toast...*

He speedwalks downstairs with his plate and aggressively gets the butter out of the fridge, spreading it over his toast unsuccessfully and ripping the toast apart. His mother notices and apologies for not doing it herself.

*Just shut up.*

He doesn’t actually tell his mom to shut up, but he thinks it. And it’s so clear that’s what he's thinking by the way he looks at her. His mother looks sad, gives him a faint smile, puts her head down and continues eating by herself. 

Asif takes his breakfast up to his computer for the second time and instantly clicks on the first enticing self improvement video about building discipline, something that is dangerously deficient in Asif. 

He eats his breakfast but doesn’t really enjoy it or even taste it much. He paid no attention to the food with his mind scattered all over the place. He scrolls down to the comments of the video and leaves his own comment, pretending to be someone that he’s not...

*I found your channel a few months ago and I’ve improved so much.* 

*I wake up early and hit a workout whilst average people are still in bed.* 

Asif posts the comment and feels good about himself for a few seconds. He likes his own comment to make it seem a little more popular. He clicks on the next video. And the next. And the next. Soon his brain feels fried. He feels like he’s in a haze.

Asif did plan to workout today but it doesn’t seem likely now.

*It’s so fucking annoying, I feel like I have a headache.*

*I was gonna hit a workout just now.*

*Maybe I’ll skip it today, but that’s annoying because I really wanted to go.*

*I’ll have a rest day today and I’ll do an extra long workout tomorrow.*

*Plus, I have so much work to do, I’ll focus on that today.*

Asif feels good about this decision, he didn’t feel like getting up from his computer anyway. 

*It’s time to start the grind.*

Asif opens up his business plan and reads it again. And again. He’s reading the words on the screen but it’s not really going inside his head. His mind wanders...

*Fuck, my nofap streak!*

He almost forgot that he reset his ‘nofap streak’ in the middle of the night again - A counter of how many days he made it without masturbating. He goes onto the nofap subreddit and starts reading the posts there, annoyed that he reset all of his progress. 

Reading the posts makes it so much worse. He reads about guys who are on Day 14 and another guy is on Day 31! And another on Day 50!! He reads the posts and is incredibly jealous of their progress and the benefits these men feel.

*Why is it so easy for everyone else?*

Asif spends the next hour alternating between binge-reading the posts on the nofap subreddit and binge-watching nofap YouTube videos. He reads a comment about an additional benefit of nofap - Having the energy to help your family and the people in your community. Asif clicks the like button on that comment just as his mother opens his bedroom door, instantly putting him into an annoyed mood. She asks him if he could hoover the house as the floors are dirty. He quickly responds that he’ll do it later and then he tells her to close his door. 

*Why does she always interrupt me when I’m working?*

Asif opens up his business plan again and glances at it one more time as he starts his business work. His business is growing an Instagram meme page and he just knows he’s going to crush it, all of the entrepreneur YouTubers say so...

*There’s meme pages with millions of followers!*

*I bet they’re making so much money from selling shoutouts.*

His business work consists of scrolling down his Instagram feed looking for memes to reupload to his account. 

He does this for 5 minutes until he searches for an Instagram model. It’s strange. He spends an awful long time researching these models and masturbating to their pictures but he also has an intense hatred for them at the same time.

*Dumb bitch.* 

*Girls have such an easy life and they don’t even know it.* 

*She literally makes money just for taking pictures of her ass.*

Asif rapidly flicks through the pictures and then clicks on the suggested tab to take his pick of a seemingly unlimited number of Instagram models. It takes seeing tens, if not hundreds of sexy pictures for him to feel satisfied now. He briefly remembers what it used to be like when he first started masturbating. His imagination was more than enough back then.

He doesn’t even enjoy it anymore. It feels like it’s fuelled by resentment rather than sexual desire. At the exact moment of climax, his negative thoughts switch back on and ruin the moment. He cleans up, inadequately. 

Feeling shameful, Asif closes the Instagram app, his business work done for the day. He proceeds to go on the nofap subreddit. He resets his nofap streak counter back to 0 days and muscle memory takes him back to YouTube. 

*You fucking loser.*

The fanboy is the final stage in the devolution of man to boy, the ultimate form of the beta.

Sooner or later on your journey, you are bound to encounter the fanboy and the phenomenon of fanboyism. Social media has greatly amplified the problem by bringing out virtually every thought and word and emotion in the minds of many people and in doing so it is absolutely astonishing how big the fanboy problem really is. And I admit it, I too have guilty of it more often than I can count. We all have been fanboys.

You find them everywhere. And they're all more easy to offend than a short tempered rattlesnake. One can't even talk about what you ate for breakfast without running into a diet fanboy these days. And then there are sports fanboys, religious fanboys, fighter jet fanboys, musician fanboys, actor fanboys, car fanboys and these days even vaccine fanboys and anti fanboys.

Name something or someone where fanboyism can't sprout. It's everywhere.

# Fanboyism is the easy way out - live through your idols

The fanboy is unwilling to take the pain and responsibility and risk involved in making a man out of himself and so finds it pretty convenient to identify with a party, a person, a cause, a religion, an ideal or an ism -- and feel like he's living through them. It's the way of the beta and its destination is to settle at the very bottom of the beta valley. Now his emotions rise and fall with the fate of whatever or whoever he's chosen to experience pseudo oneness with. His hero is challenged on Twitter? God he'll make the world pay, maybe in the comments section.

Many other fanboys have done far worse acts thanks to their excess obsession.

# What's at the core of a fanboy? A child who never grew up

The common man has always been a fool, a dependent child at heart who won't admit it, waiting for the day the messiah comes to save him not knowing that power is already within himself, and which he has been giving away to others way too much to be exploited and deceived.

**Fanboyism is what happens when love is reduced to mere emotion, with the awareness and wisdom part lost**. There's just enough rationality left to support the emotional mind in fulfilling its fanboy fantasies.

Since a fanboy operates primarily out of emotion, with his rational consciousness mostly reduced to a hamster, a fanboy is pretty much a child at heart, and that part of their minds never caught up with the rest of themselves. And that isn't a good thing.

# Your fanboyism is setting you up for exploitation

To be honest, only the rare few in the world who actually know what's in your best interests and and actually care a damn about you want you to realize your own personal power for your own benefit. For thousands of years, pretty much everyone from your toddlers (yes) all the way to your presidents and religious messengers have been using this ignorance to benefit themselves. They all know that the only way to keep you asleep and ignorant of your own personal power is to keep you trapped in codependency, stop you from ever truly growing up.

As a fanboy, you're not free from your overlords, because you're not free from yourself.

# Fanboyism is turning you into a monster

It doesn't end with loss of your personal power alone. Fanboyism in extreme leads to such loss of intuition, personal frame and basic sense that it turns you into a brainwashed, even depraved, degenerate individual in short order. At their most benign, a fanboy is no more emotionally intelligent than a toddler. But it can also get dangerous when it takes on more complex forms.

For eg. Look at the people who don't mind waging wars and killing others - many of them are really fanboys of some ideal to the extreme. Cults, extremists, political gangs, terrorists, people sending death threats because their team lost a match. All of them are fanboys - it's just a question of degree.

# And of course, a fanboy is not complete without fighting with other fanboys

With the most noble intentions of course, the worst quarrels and wars are waged. **The path to hell is paved with the best intentions and terrible acts of idols, ideals and their fanboys.**

A fanboy's biggest problem is his absolute conviction that he is right. In only a couple of short steps, he goes from well intentioned white knight, to looking down on others, and then to an actual agent of war, committing violence against anyone who disagrees, and feeling absolutely justified in his monstrosity.

If you look closely, a lot of individual and collective violence in the world all boils down to some kind of fanboy behaviour or the other. Nearly all arguments on social media are certainly just different fanboys colliding online with each other. Even World Wars and terrorism if you look at it, are really overblown forms of fanboyism at their heart, yes.

The definition of the term fanboy is grossly incomplete if it doesn't speak about their primal lust for fighting against other fanboys. If you aren't eager to start a fight, you're not a true fanboy yet.

It may be race, nation, religion, movie star, sport, belief, some-ism, ideal, politics, etc. etc. but the strongest fanboys are always found in times of war.

# There are three ways of becoming a fanboy

Self inflicted - The vast majority of fanboys turn themselves into one. They just fall in obsessive love with someone or something they admire and with that, their rational mind and intuition is packed off, locked and exiled away.

Socially conditioned from childhood - Your parents, teachers, society and other authority figures on whom you have to depend on as a kid actively push you into staying infantile and blue pilled, which in turn causes you to put others on a pedestal, or drag others into the gutter.

Reverse aged by malicious influencers -- The only thing worse than the above two causes of fanboy-itis is when you're influenced and reverse aged from an intelligent, sensible man into a zombie of a co-dependent boy -- in some cases, such as certain cults or fundamentalist movements, this is an actual control tactic.  Of course, maybe academia and social justice movements should be included in this category of fanboy factories.

For the most part, your fanboy problems are really your own damned fault. Especially as we grow older and we can think and observe for ourselves.

# The solution lies in destroying your idols and your compulsion for idolatory

Your journey to being a man isn't complete until you've realized this side of yourself and how much you do it unconsciously, and how much it negatively impacts your life.

Destroy your idols the day you realize what you truly are. Then see them exactly as they are as far as you can and keep them exactly where they need to be (or not) in your life. Living through your idols is the easy way out. For once turn all that time and energy and emotion to the one who really needs it - you.

Your idols need not be a certain person or made of stone. Pretty much anything that turns you into a degenerate fanboy fuels idolatory.

We're not talking about turning anti-fanboy, that's just fanboyism from the other end. The opposite of crazy is still crazy and because you went from a fierce devotee to a rabid hater doesn't mean you've outgrown the fanboy - you're just suffering from a type of artificially induced bipolar disorder. Otherwise emotionally you're exactly the same as before.

We even had a few fanboys of some of our veterans here, and many of them have since then probably turned anti fanboys after knowing a little more about their idols, but I wonder how many actually got the message that life was trying to teach them.

# You, fanboy, are your own biggest barrier to growth

A fanboy's biggest obstacle to his own growth and facing the truth is his own brainwashed conviction in his absolute rightness and the hair trigger reactivity of his emotional mind that shuts down his objective awareness.

As an extreme example, one of the things we've learned from interrogating captured terrorists / extremists is how absolutely convinced they are that they're doing the right thing or that they've been promised heaven in the end for their ""devotion"" or some other belief that controls their entire behavior. Their belief in their own righteousness blocks off their conscience.

Only by consciously recognizing his own dysfunction and cracking open his subconscious beliefs and toxic emotional traits can this initial barrier be dissolved. After that transformation is a lot easier. Getting there is the hard part.

# Growing from boy to man is just like learning to walk

At first you fall many times, get hurt even. But either you hold someone's hand and lift yourself up or something else for support until you can stand unaided. Once you learn to walk, walk on your own, because you can and should.

Listen to others, look at their success and failures and mistakes, but filter out what works for you and what you want. Your life, your choices, your consequences, your ownership. Don't forget the last two.

Ultimately as a man, once you've grown out of the dependent boy, even your idols are just other men with their own successes and their own issues just like you. Knowing this kind of levels the field in a way and at some point you realize that you're where your father or father figure was once upon a time and that we're not all that different.

# You will soon recognize the snake oil salesmen who need you to remain in fanboy valley

You will soon meet many people of no real integrity in the ""Save the world"" and ""Good intentions"" movements, and you may safely forget the existence of most of them. The frauds may go on to fool and make plenty of bucks out of the fools, without offering anything of honest, actual worth in return, but you no longer have to be among that crowd.

Snake oil is sold in many bottles - pretty much anything and everything where fanboyism is possible, there's a peddler there minting off of collective ignorance, promising to be your Lord and Savior in some form or the other and then laughing at your foolishness behind the scenes, at your expenses. Politicians do it, religions do it, ideologies do it, institutions do it, social media does it, the news media do it, these days even diets do it.

Pretty much all future utopia peddlers of any form do it. I mean you have to actually wonder who doesn't do it.

All of them need you to remain fanboys and you need them to remain as your idols. Or else it's the end of both identities.

The good news is you as an individual, with this new level of awareness, are free from their influence to a great extent compared to before. You can now focus more on the actual issues in your life that really need all that attention.

You will also see how so many desperate people pin their hopes on these false messiahs like the needy children they still are -- not having gone through the same painful awakening process as yourself and still not having learnt how to recognize their own worth. But really the snake oil salesmen are just other human beings like all of us. Their rot runs deep, but if anything -- **their rot is only a mirror that reflects our own rot and compliments it**. Cheaters and the cheated need each other for the pattern to survive - they both thrive off each other.

Either one can choose to end the game, but in the end your life has always been your responsibility, so get proactive for a change, instead of being a fanboy living in reactivity.

The whole idolatory game needs fanboys for the idols to exist, and vice versa.

# Over time, everything and everyone starts to settle down where they really belong in your life

People are no longer all on the pedestal or totally in the gutter. Life is not just black and white. There is much more nuance and deeper understanding. Over time you withdraw from giving your personal power away so cheaply and start putting all those things and people you fanboy-ed over in their proper place in your life and universe.

It's an art just like anything else. But it begins with honestly accepting everything about your idols, both the good and the bad and the ugly.

# Of course all this is true for girls too, often even more so

Madam, I know what's on your mind. You didn't see a single female noun or pronoun so far and you can feel the outrage building, starting from a point where you seemingly feel unloved. You just HAVE to be included in this too of course. It feels like dying when it isn't about you, and doesn't include you. You, just like all women, want to prove yourself the exception (the irony...) and want to point out men aren't that different. Maybe in the distant past rejection meant death in the wild, but be present in the reality of this moment.

I sense the feeling of rightenousness fueling your rage hearing my advice. How dare I tell you the truth! Se\*\*\*t creep! I tell you this isn't a big issue. No! It's worse than the universe ending. I tell you that you could be wrong? Blasphemy! I dare disrespect your mighty feelings? Gather the sisterhood and demand my head! Down with the evil patriarchy!

I would say in your knee jerk reaction as a fangirl of the feminine, you're actually missing a wonderful opportunity to dissolve that ego and pain and awaken to better consciousness. This is a man's sub, all male pronouns here. No apologies.

But guys, do expect girls and women to be even more irrational and extreme about it than you bargained for. **I mean just see what identifying with a certain -ism did to them**. That too is another form of fan madness.  I am sure a topic like this can't really be discussed in this analytical manner with most of the girls I know. And even if you did, it will only last till some emotion gets triggered, usually caused by an attack on something she's a fangirl of.

And for women it can get even more collectively crazy, given that some part of every woman is really a collective consciousness of the feminine herd.

# You can be a fan of others, but don't be a fanboy

Fanboyism of anyone or anything, even the real deal who walk their talk, is the ultimate beta trait. It's often one of those lingering bad habits that only goes away much further down the road, because recognizing it and all the forms it takes isn't easy. **Most fanboys do not actually want to end their fanboyism, because there is a huge sense of being right over others attached to it.** A lot of time and energy was invested into that identity, and now it resists facing itself in the mirror.

There's nothing wrong in admiring others, watching them do the impossible and cheering for someone you like, or fighting for a cause. But hey, in loving them, don't lose sight of reality, don't forget to love yourself, don't forget to see what's actually happening to you.

Admire them all you want, experience the triumps and heartbreaks if you wish, but don't descend back down into becoming a fanboy. **You're a man now.**

*EDIT : Fixed the spelling of fanboi to fanboy instead. These days I see more and more of the former doing the rounds. The title cannot be changed once created though.*",1642097413.0
212,Hypergamy Doesn't Care Whatever You Did For Her.,425,s2mjct,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s2mjct/hypergamy_doesnt_care_whatever_you_did_for_her/,76,"Hypergamy is when women find a good match, she will still delay and see if she can do better, or attract a even higher value man. Or, if she found a good match, she will monkey branch to a potential higher value male, while she's ""with"" you. Remember gentleman, while she's with you, her subconscious mind is always telling her that she can do better than this, and she will be on the constant lookout for a ""better"" guy. You shouldn't be surprised as this is in her natural biology. 



But is she on the constant lookout 24/7 for a ""better"" guy than you? The answer is No. As long as you have frame, and she respects you, and you have other options, and are on your purpose, she will stick around. But slowly, if you start slacking ""frame"" and make her your first priority in life instead of your ambitions, then don't be surprised if she cheats or dumps you. She likes the idea of you, and wants to be part of your life. But she doesn't want your life to revolve around her.


Where majority of men get it wrong, and I learnt the hard way as well was that, as you become more ""close"" and spend more time with her, you slowly start to open up and lose ""frame."" The worst thing a man can ever do is ""open up"" to a women. The best advice I got was from a senior writer here which was, women have this idea ingrained in them that men are strong, stoic and non emotional beings. Just imagine a Lion for a second. We have this idea ingrained in us that a Lion is the king of the jungle, and a strong animal that can kick ass. But say, this Lion was to show weakness and ""open up"" what would happen? You would shit test the hell out of the Lion like it's nothing because you now know that it was all talk, and you would think to yourself as a fool that you ever thought this Lion was so ""strong."" In just matter of seconds, all this ""respect"" you had for the lion as the ""King of the jungle"" would go down the drain and you would now look at the same lion as ""weak."" Same exact way women see men, once they open up and show any weakness. That's why being emotionally stoic and strong and showing no emotion infront of a women is very necessary.

My dad died? I lost my job? Or any tragedy happened in my life? No one cares. If you want to ""open up"" go cry to your best friend, but NEVER infront of a women. I learnt the hard way, and we all made mistakes. The only person that can fix your life, is yourself. Good friends will give beneficial advices and what not, but no one can make you do anything except yourself. And women? She actually fears that if you open up to her, she'll lose all the respect she had for you. She cannot fix your problems, and if you think by ""opening up"" to her will make her ""respect"" you more? That's the easiest way for you to get cheated on, and make her drier than the Sahara Desert and she'll leave you faster than lighting strikes. Always remember that Lion analogy.




Coming back to hypergamy, the reality is, the average women who is liberal minded and who went to Uni/college has had more cocks stuffed in her mouth then you can imagine. Most women are only plate material. If you think of marrying anyone of them, then I'm sorry. There isn't a bigger fool than you. After getting used and abused by many ""bad boys"" in her uni days, majority of women then become emotionally broken/damaged man-hating feminists, who you will never be to able to please. Why? Because she has experienced it all. Now, her standards are even higher. 


Remember gentlemen, to ""mess around"" a women will never choose the beta buxx Dr Kareem, or that soyboy male feminist who gets applauded by everyone for standing up in favour of women rights. To ""mess around"", a women will only choose the most ""baddest"" boy ever who makes her panties soaked by even the taught of him, and after she had her fair share of fun, she will then blame those ""bad boys"" for being so ""toxic"" and she will become a emotionally damaged man-hating feminist. Also known as the broken or Alpha widowed women.

I'm a Muslim. A lot of people have a misconception of Muslim girls being ""virgin"" and will submit to her husband till the day she dies, once she gets married. I can testify, Muslim girls are one of the best chameleons out there preying on the beta buxxes (to please her religious parents) after having their good fair share of fun in university. 


 Beta buxxes, aka which I like to call Dr Kareem's who put their head down and study for 12 long hard years for a good salary (and think it will make women attracted to them) and to find a ""good"" wife are only suitable for her after she had her fair share of fun, and wants him for his ""lifelong"" comfortable income and as a ""husband"" material. But deep down, she wishes she could have it ""all"" and wishes that the Dr Kareem would be as her unreliable exes. But she didn't marry the bad boy because either he didn't stay around, or because they aren't wealthy, or of what ""others"" will think of her, if she's with them. (Societal pressure). So she ends up settling with the ""boring safe guy"" who will pay all her bills, but she will never be truly wet for him.


Now, many women think they are entitled to the top 1 percent of men, just because of their beauty. We have many simps who worship them, and because of social media validation and so on, many women think just because of their beauty, they deserve a HVM. When in reality, many of these women lack character, femininity, and genuine respect for men. The only thing they are bringing to the table is their pussy. Other than that? Nothing. They hate a man, if that man provides no value to her. It all comes back to two things which is money and attention (which beta buxx provides) or emotional rollercoaster/drama (which alpha provides). Other than that, 95% of men provide no value to her. So, she dislikes majority of men. 



 **The reality is, there will always be a better man in wealth, status and looks. No matter how much you ""self improve"" there will always be a better man out there than you. But this doesn't mean you stop ""self improving."" The day you stop self improving is the day you die.**


If she's with you right now, you're her highest option available. The day any higher value male comes along and interests her, or if you lose frame, she will be gone. All men must remember 1 thing, Hypergamy doesn't care. No matter how much frame you have, or whatever you did for her, she doesn't care. It's in her biology to mate with the highest value male possible she can find, and she will leave you once she finds someone higher of value. And this is where the harsh red pill truth comes in, and you have to accept the cold hard fact no matter how much it shocks you.

In conclusion, no matter how long you've been with her, you must acknowledge hypergamy is ingrained in her natural biology. Be emotionally stoic and strong, never open up, stay on your purpose and don't make her the #1 priority in your life. The other best advice I got was, ""Whatever it is, always do less with women, and the more they'll do with you."" And in the end, if you follow everything, and she still ends up dumping you, or cheating on you, then you must be stoic and acknowledge, ""In the end, she's never yours. It's only your turn.""",1642036669.0
213,The Break Up Triage: How To Handle Getting Dumped Like A Man,306,s1rzph,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s1rzph/the_break_up_triage_how_to_handle_getting_dumped/,92,"Good afternoon TRP.

Today I want to cover something that a lot of men in this sub find relevant, and something that EVERY man will go through as they learn game.  And that is, **what to do when you get dumped and how to handle it with dignity.**

There are a variety of reasons and situations that bring men to the Red Pill for answers, but it is without a doubt getting dumped that is the most common factor.

**So with that in mind, let's understand who this post is for:**

\-It's for men who are new to RP that just got dumped.

\-It's for men who have spent time with the information and are still learning, so you can be prepared for when it happens

\-It's for men who have found a plate they like and spending more and more time with, so you can know how to navigate the situation if things go south

\-It's for men who are married or in an LTR, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN.

This post is not very relevant for dudes running the gauntlet with women every night who only like one-night-stands or unemotional fuck buddies, or for dudes so far gone in their relationship your woman is cheating on you or something crazy like that.  If you've been seeing a bitch for one week, this shit also likely won't work as an emotional bond has to have been established for her to care.

Phase 1: **Survival** \- Depending on how long you've been with a woman, the breakup can come as a shock to the system, and often is for a lot of dudes not in touch with their woman's attraction level.  This revelation can cause you to say and do some extremely stupid things.  This will lead to bad, bad situations that will escalate quickly and more importantly, WILL GIVE A BITCH EMOTIONAL SATISFACTION.  The worst thing you can do is feed into a woman's negative emotions, especially when the stakes are as high as ending a relationship.  **YOUR GOAL DURING THE BREAK UP IS TO GET SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND HER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE.**  You may be feeling like shit and your dumb emotional lizard brain may be wanting to rationalize with her, but it is imperative that you don't.  The single best reaction you can have is one of cool indifference.  Or at least appearing that you are indifferent.  This denies women the ability to have closure, and will quickly make her second guess her decision as you agree with her and show no signs of caring.

Phase 2: **No Contact** \- Once you and her have been split up, you must immediately go into No Contact Mode.  **What is No Contact Mode?  It means staying the fuck away from her ability to communicate with you.**  No calls, no texts, no liking her stupid social media posts, nothing.  Delete her number from your phone, go silent on social media, etc.  You become a memory to her, and quickly.  What this does is provide an emotional shock to her system, as the reality quickly sets in that the person who was in her life every day is now gone.  If she loves or loved you, this will have an even stronger effect on her.  This complete disappearance has the same effect on her as the monster you never see in a horror movie.  Her imagination fills in all the gaps of what you're up to, essentially doing all the hard work you want to do yourself by rationally talking to her.  Keep the fuck away from her.

Phase 3: **Stop the Bleeding** \- Depending on where you were at in the relationship, some very strong anxiety will eventually bubble to the surface as your masculine propensity to fix things that are broken tries to drive you to reach out to her.  You must take this time to reflect and work on becoming who you ideally want to be.  Those emotions you have are fine and normal, but the No Contact Mode is a great experience for you to learn how to control what are sometimes VERY strong emotions.  The important thing to remember as a man is it's normal to feel sad when you were in love with somebody and they're gone, but you're only a little pussy when you act on it.  These emotions will be VERY PROMINENT if you are married and have children.  You must fill the time you have with productive shit.  Get into the gym more.  Go out and socialize.  Drive up into the mountains for a weekend of camping.  **Do whatever it is you need to do to keep your thoughts off your phone and what she is doing.**

Phase 4: **Battle Buddy** \- One thing a lot of men I've worked with have trouble with is UNDERSTANDING why the breakup happened.  As dudes, we like to break shit apart to get to the root of it.  One of the best ways to deal with this inability to get closure on your end is to find a friend (a dude, DO NOT TALK TO WOMEN ABOUT THIS SHIT) and piece together your thoughts on that matter.  This helps you see the bigger picture of what happened and what you can do to make sure it doesn't happen again.  Another great resource is YouTube.  There are a ton of videos and people who talk about the No Contact method, and listening to them explain it all will reassure your decisions if you start to get cold feet.

Phase 5: **The Second Wave** \- If you've followed these steps to a T, if your woman had any attraction left for you at all, she will eventually reach out to you.  Depending on how dominant you were, it might just be a simple ""Hey"" or a 5 page letter where they confess their undying love and devotion for you.    Regardless, you must play this next move VERY CAREFULLY.  DO NOT, AND I REPEAT, DO NOT RUSH BACK INTO TAKING THEM BACK.  You left indifferent, you're still indifferent.  Keep the conversation short and take a lot of time in between responses.  This gets her anticipating your responses almost like a drug, and it shows that her behavior and choices has some very real, and frightening consequences.  She still doesn't know how you feel, and that is where you want her for a while.  You can agree to let her come over one night to bring you dinner and after you fuck her brains out, send her on her way.  When a woman breaks up with you, they MUST earn their way back by your side.  If you even want her back at all.

&#x200B;

Edit:  One last thing.  You must be prepared to never talk to her again.  Don't break No Contact for any reason.  Doing so takes away your power and will make things worse for you, even if you do end up back together as a result.

I hope this helps some of you.  Feel free to share your thoughts!",1641946624.0
214,A Woman's Beauty and The Desire To Fuck Should Be Stronger Than Rejection,156,s1hfgg,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s1hfgg/a_womans_beauty_and_the_desire_to_fuck_should_be/,37,"I know that a lot of you may not want to hear this but the only way to overcome the fear of rejection is getting rejected... repeatedly.  In my opinion, I find overcoming the fear of rejection to be more beneficial than getting the girl.

Why do I say this?

Let's say I fear rejection and I go out and approach some women.  I get lucky (I don't like saying lucky but in this example, it is luck because on my first day I get a yes) and on my 3rd approach I get a phone number which turns into a date.  Six months pass and the relationship goes in the opposite direction.  She wants to break up.  If I fear rejection, I'm not gonna want to go back out onto the dating market because instead of my 3rd approach it may take me 100 approaches to get the girl.  I am a mess!  This is how a lot of men are when it comes to getting women.  Once they get her, they fear losing her because they fear the process of going out and getting another woman to replace her, which may take months or years because these men avoid rejection.

Let's say I don't fear rejection.  Actually I embrace it as if it's a part of the process.  When I get a woman and she decides to leave or I have to break up with her, I don't fear the dating market.  It's like going back into the wild after being domesticated for a while.  You look forward to all the abundance of young attractive women out there who are ready for the dating market as an adult.

I don't have the mindset of ""I hope she says yes"" when I approach women.  I have the mindset of, 

""She looks good.  Let me see what happens"", then I approach.

I focus on being bold, solid, and confident in each approach I do.  If I get rejected, I self-assess my approach.  If I was bold, solid, and confident in my approach, I feel good about the approach, even if I was rejected.  If I was timid in my approach, I give a quick self-critique.  The next approach I usually feel good about taking action so I go in bolder, more solid, and more confident.

After doing approaches for a few months, I notice that women are usually polite when they reject you.  It's usually a ""I have a boyfriend"" or ""I'm married"".  I only got one flat out ""No"" and another was a ""No"" but followed with she was talking to someone.  In both these  cases, the women weren't rude or disrespectful.

Using the direct approach when you meet women saves you a lot of time, but you will notice that the conversion rate is low... even for a phone number.  Honestly, I would rather not get a phone number from a woman who just wants my non-sexual attention (shout out to Alan Roger Currie) instead of fuck because she has a boyfriend.  I think indirect can get you a higher conversion rate as far as a phone number goes, but it may take longer to get her to have sex with you if she has a boyfriend.  Also, men tend to try and work one girl to convert into a date instead of play the number's game and move as quickly as possible.

Accepting rejection is something that's important as well.  If a woman tells me she has a boyfriend, the only rebuttal I'll give is ""is it serious?"".  If they tell me yes, I leave it alone.  If it's not serious, then I'll tell her to exchange numbers.  I don't try to convince women to choose me or cheat on their boyfriend because there are way too many available women I haven't got to yet.  I have an abundance mentality.  I look for places where there are attractive women out and about in large numbers and I'll see new attractive women each time I go there.

When you don't fear rejection, you are quicker to approach.  The woman's beauty and your desire to fuck becomes stronger than rejection.  When I go somewhere and I see an attractive woman, my mind goes, ""let's go talk to her"".  The first approach is the hardest.  But you have to pop your ""rejection cherry"" in order to reap the rewards of leaning towards fearlessness instead of fearful when you approach the women you really want and desire most.

215,"GOAL: Go Out And Learn; the psychology and physiology of attraction, agitation, and anxiety",268,s0t2n9,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s0t2n9/goal_go_out_and_learn_the_psychology_and/,20,"it seems necessary to repost this after all these years to counter the idiotic ramblings of guys who recommend approaching 1703 women per annum for 20 years etc. AND all the guys who HAVE NO EXPERIENCE with it saying dark triad traits don't work in LTRs (spoiler: they do) and all the other garbage stuck in the drain; here you go:

&nbsp;

*Attraction and arousal* are good things, and *agitation and anxiety* are bad things, right? Wrong. They are **all the same**, from a strictly physiological standpoint. To be specific, **the physiological signs of attraction and agitation are indistinguishable.**

&nbsp;

Increased blood pressure, elevated heart rate, muscular tension, flushing, and the attendant effects of light-headedness, perhaps increased perspiration, and that pit-of-the-stomach feeling. These same physiological signs can appear in **completely different contexts,** and the context is what differentiates them in the felt experience of the person. **The physical feeling gets labeled as an emotion: fear, anxiety, or attraction, depending on the situation.**

&nbsp;

Given that these disparate states of mind are accompanied by the same physical states of being, you would expect attraction to do funny things to people, especially women. When a woman is attracted to a man, I mean truly attracted and turned on, she often doesn't know why. Consider again the physiological signs: elevated heart rate and blood pressure, flushing, butterflies in the stomach? That doesn't sound like fun: basically she is **uncomfortable**; not an entirely pleasant feeling.

&nbsp;

It's a different thing for men, though.

We all know about sexual dimorphism, but this is another important, less well-acknowledged, physical difference between men and women: **our hormones are always on, they don't cycle throughout the month** (male hormones do cycle through the day). As men, we are accustomed to this: this feeling is with us every day, to a certain extent. That's one reason we are ready for action at all times. 

That's why these physiological signs are not typically experienced as unpleasant for men, unless it's the extreme of frustration; then it is unpleasant, but not unfamiliar. It's normal. Men are also, quite frankly, more in tune with their bodies than women are, generally speaking (more than half the women I have known have shown themselves to be woefully unprepared for their period way too often; this is something that happens to them EVERY FUCKING MONTH, and yet, *oh shit I'm bleeding all over my panties*). 

But for women, again, it's not normal, it's uncomfortable, it's unpleasant to have that physical sensation, not know what it is, and not know how to quell it.

&nbsp;

It's this unpleasant feeling that spurs action. **She wants to rid herself of this agitation, one way or another.** Hopefully, it's by getting fucked hard, and not just punching you in the arm and calling you an asshole.

&nbsp;

**A. THIS EXPLAINS SOME KEY CONCEPTS.**

&nbsp;

**I. Dread.**

I hate the PUA lingo, but dread is real, and it's real effective. Why? Is it because she KNOWS you have options? LOL. **Women don't think, they feel.** (That's why dread isn't very effective by you TELLING her about your options.) She SEES that you have options, and that goes right to her stomach. 

Then she has that good anxiety, all those unpleasant physiological signs. **The physical feeling needs to be turned into an emotion** -- that's how the human body works. So you get her in a situation where you allow her brain to **label that feeling: arousal.** Otherwise, it's just jealousy, and that's a real drag to deal with.

&nbsp;

**II. Push/Pull.**

Why does this work so wonderfully, and why does Push work better than Pull? Because it goes right to the center of her self-image. When you are pushing her away you are instilling that good anxiety again. 

You should not think of this as a *technique or a tactic.* That's fake. **Push/Pull should be a lifestyle.** I am doing about 90% push and having most excellent results. Why? **Because I am making her uncomfortable and agitated, and she needs to get out of that state by getting fucked.** 

*What? I thought women needed to be comfortable before they were ready for sex!*  LOLOLOL. No they do not. They need to be agitated. 

&nbsp;

**III. Betafication of Long-Term Partners.**

Women need a good provider for their offspring. *And so they shit-test their partner until the former alpha is a beta provider who has no other options?* If you think that's a good evolutionary explanation then you are guilty of backwards thinking.

When women are sexually attracted to a man, they experience those aforementioned physiological signs, which are uncomfortable. **They seek to alleviate their discomfort.** That's what biological creatures do. It's a basic drive.

In evolutionary terms, **the women who have done that, via the basic stress-reduction drive, are the ones who have succeeded at procuring the provider.** And then they are the ones who have passed on their genes.

So now in modern times, in long-term relationships, women can fulfill this ancient drive **not by having sex every day,** which is exhausting, **but more easily for the fundamentally lazy and selfish woman,** by encouraging the man himself to become less sexy and appealing. 

&nbsp;

**IV. Women Stay with Their Abusers.**

Self-explanatory at this point. However, for the autists and the bloopers, not a good transition to the next section (let me spell it out: *practical applications* does not mean be an abuser).

&nbsp;

**B. WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU: PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS.**

&nbsp;

**I. Don't Be Afraid to Have a Woman Be Mad at You.**

I made a recent post about the importance of not being pussy-whipped: [Memorial Day Weekend Cuck-Out](http://archive.is/jhzGS). This was the central message of that post. 

So many men are wrongly terrified of the consequences of having a woman be mad at them. So sad. And so ironic, because **there are no consequences, and if you do it right, there are only benefits.**

Having her be agitated because she's mad at you may mean that she fucks right off out of your life. Counts as a win in my book. Or if she wants to stick around, see next point.

&nbsp;

**II. More Sex with Less Effort in a LTR; plus, An Extreme Example.**

**Stop being nice. Stop doing things for her. Don't hold back when you want to tell her she is doing stupid shit. Ignore her when she wants attention. You can go so far as actively be mean and cruel to her.** As long as you have initial attraction. Let me repeat: this is for LTRs only, and after you really have her hooked.

This is the extreme example, also from my recent post; analysis follows:

> I have actually said the words *Fuck off* to this woman; I was serious, and it was warranted. **Doghouse,** right? Wrong. She left me alone for a while (wonderful silence). Then not 8 hours later, without a word, she initiates, we fuck; all positions, including ones she has claimed were *uncomfortable* or *too strenuous* for her. After it's over, she says, in a very sweet voice, *You shouldn't say ""Fuck off"" to me.* Similar things have happened, many times.

What happened between the time I made that most incorrigible, offensive remark and when we had that great energetic sex? She was agitated and set off, and she was thinking about it. More precisely, **she was thinking about me.** 

It doesn't matter that the thoughts and feelings were negative. Women aren't logical; as my old French-Canadian hockey coach used to say, *Tank gawd fer det.*

&nbsp;

**III. Planning Activities (other than sex) with a Woman.**

Hard to believe, but dudes are still taking women to movies or dinner as a first date; I've seen this recently on this very sub. SMH. I don't even need to explain how stupid that is.

Get physical: mountain biking, rock climbing, hiking, surfing. Haunted house. Mosh pit. Vandalism, if that's your thing. Explosives. Breaking and entering, whatever. Not only is this shit FUN, but it actually **increases feelings of attraction.**

There are some very interesting psychological studies that support my original point. The researchers got people **agitated** and then approached by an attractive confederate (for those who don't know, that's someone in on the research but unknown to the person in the experiment). Those in the experimental group rated the confederate as **more attractive** than the control group of unagitated persons did.

(If you want to read more, you can look these up. Schachter & Singer gave subjects **a shot of epinephrine,** then exposed them to either a happy or an angry confederate: the subjects mirrored the emotion; they developed the *two-factor theory of emotions* to explain the subsequent emotional reactions. Berscheid & Walster's experiment had subjects **exercise vigorously** before being approached; they called the phenomenon *the misattribution of arousal.* Dutton & Aron had subjects **cross a scary suspension bridge over a 230-foot chasm,** and the control group crossed a sturdy cedar bridge over a small gurgling stream; in this case **fear resulted in higher attraction** toward the confederate. For the bloopers who are going to say *Citation needed!* do you want a link to the book that is sitting on my desk? I gave you the authors' names and key words to Google, you lazy fucks.)

&nbsp;

**Take a woman who may be somewhat attracted to you on a scary adventure; she will become MORE attracted to you.**

216,Please criticize the beginning of this chapter in my book.,18,s0oj3y,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s0oj3y/please_criticize_the_beginning_of_this_chapter_in/,31,"Ok, so here is the beginning of a chapter in my new book. The chapter is titled ""Power, Status, and Domination."" Please let me know if this is corny or good. Thanks.

\--

The strangest text I ever received from a woman before a first date was the following: “I am looking forward to our date tonight. I will meet you in the back room of \[restaurant\] at 7:30. They know me there. You will order the steak and have a glass of wine.” This text was strange for several reasons, primarily because a woman had never told me what to do order on a date.  

But this was not an ordinary woman: this woman was a professional dominatrix who owned a sex dungeon. The previous weekend she had approached me at a nightclub, looked me up and down, and said, “You look submissive and I need a new sex slave. Let’s go on a date next weekend.” I answered by saying “Sorry, but I am not submissive at all. I will, however, go on a date with you.” She smiled and took my phone number. The next day she texted me and set up a date for the next week, which again is rare for a woman to do. 

The dominatrix and I arrived to the date playing different games. She was trying to destroy my manhood and turn me into a submissive sex slave, and I was trying to see if I could hold frame with a dominatrix and make her submissive. Even though this woman’s entire identity was built around dominating men and women, I wanted to test my hypothesis that every woman, deep down, wants to be dominated by a man. They just need to find the right man. I was excited for the challenge because although holding frame is difficult around any beautiful woman, holding frame is especially difficult around a woman who is used to degrading men. 

When I arrived at the restaurant, the first thing I did was ask the waiter for a menu to figure out what to order. The dominatrix glared at me, saying “I TOLD you to order the steak.” I flashed a giant grin and asked “Why? What is so special about this steak?” She said, “It is the best steak you will ever have.” I actually wanted to try to the steak, so I figured the most beta thing to do was NOT order the steak just to win some power game with this bitch, so I decided to order the steak but frame it as if I were making the decision on my own and her suggestion that I order the steak was her validating herself to me. After I finished the steak, I looked at her and said “That was delicious. It was not the best steak I have ever had, but you did a good job. Thank you.”

The rest of the date was a series of games like this where she would try to take the lead, and I would try to hold my frame and take the lead, all while being polite and lighthearted. It was fun. I did not say anything explicitly, but I implicitly made a very clear offer to her: “You can enjoy my interesting, charming, fun, funny self, but only if I am in charge.” As the night dragged on, I could see her slowly getting sucked into the vortex of my frame and allowing me, bit by bit, to take the lead. For example, when we left the restaurant, she was walking ahead of me and I was following her, but when we left the next venue, I was walking ahead and she was following me.

The hotter, crazier, and more used to bossing around men a woman is, the more rapid and crazy her shit tests will become before she surrenders and lets another man take the lead. Because this woman was a dominatrix, I thought I was ready for anything, but things got out of hand when we got to my apartment. At first, she started doing the normal hot girl thing where she brags and tries to look cool, which is always a good sign because that means she is validating herself to you and asking for your acceptance and acknowledgement. But in the middle of her bragging, she pulled a gun out of her purse and waving it around to look cool, and telling a story about how some guy tried to mug her at a gas station and she pulled the gun out on him and scared him away. 

Now I generally think I can hold frame in most situations, but a crazy drunk sex worker waving a gun around in my apartment was too much for me. I started to get nervous, especially given that she was holding the gun in a sloppy way. I calmly said “that’s a beautiful gun, but I feel a little uncomfortable. Can you please put it back in your purse?” She brushed the barrel of the gun against her cheek and said “what are you afraid of?” In that moment I was genuinely scared because I knew if I said something weak or beta she could flip back into dominatrix mode and I would be stuck in a tiny apartment with a crazy, drunk, narcissistic maniac with a gun in her hand who thought I was “submissive” to her. To defuse the situation, I looked deep into her eyes, took a deep breath and said in my most confident and assertive voice possible, “I want you to put the gun away because I am afraid I will get turned on.” She flashed a giant grin and put the gun back into her purse. 

We then had sex. 

If you think that playing these power games is stupid and immature, I completely agree. In a modern, rational, society, it makes no sense that a woman’s attraction to a man would in any way be based on whether she picks the restaurant or him, whether he decides the next bar, or other silly power games. It is even stupider that a woman’s attraction would differ solely based on how the man framed the situation. But it is a cold, hard fact of human nature that humans evolved to view relationships, especially romantic and sexual relationships, in terms of power. In every romantic relationship, there is a pursuer and a pursued, a wanter and a wanted, a higher and a lower, a person with more power and a person with less power.

The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche made an interesting observation about dominance hierarchies in his book The Genealogy of Morals. Nietzsche claimed that individuals at the bottom of dominance hierarchies – “slaves”, as he put it – have a deep, emotional obsession with the individuals at the top of the hierarchies – the “masters.” The slaves constantly think about their masters and develop a form of resentment Nietzsche called “ressentiment.” The masters, however, think or feel nothing about the slaves at all. Nietzsche claimed that ressentiment actually gives slaves an advantage – the masters do not notice when the slaves are plotting to overthrow the masters. 

Nietzsche’s theory of ressentiment makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. Individuals at the top of the hierarchy must focus their thoughts and emotions on the tribe’s mission so they have a natural tendency to ignore individuals beneath them (this, by the way, is why women ignore men they view as beta). Folks at the bottom of the hierarchy, however, must focus their thoughts and emotions on the folks at the top so they obey their masters and remain accepted. This explains the stereotypical conflict in many romantic relationships – the woman holds something dear – an anniversary, a feeling, a special moment – and the man completely forgets or overlooks that thing. 

For the reasons Nietzsche described, women feel ressentiment in relationships and mens’ failure to notice or empathize with womens’ ressentiment often brings them to ruin. Put another way, women are obsessed with power because they naturally evolved to feel like they have none. Men, on the other hand, think little about power because they are naturally powerful, the same way a person in a rich country thinks much less about food than a starving person in a third world country. Furthermore, womens’ ressentiment causes women to constantly play and win power games against men that men do not even realize are happening. 

As a man, once you understand the importance of power in relationships to women, the game becomes much, much easier. Not only will you be more successful in your relationships, the women will be more happy. Women WANT their man to be the alpha male – only damaged, broken women want to be with a beta male.

217,Game For Young Men (Ages 18-30s)--Simple Strategy To Sleep With Nothing But Attractive Women Over A 20-Year Period,22,s0axip,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/s0axip/game_for_young_men_ages_1830ssimple_strategy_to/,68,"I don't say this to get your hopes high, but I say it because it's possible.  Here's all you have to do:

1. Don't focus on getting the girl, Focus on taking action. If you get rejected, it's still a victory.  Your goal is to approach women in a bold, solid, and confident manner.
2. Play the number's game.  The more women you approach, the more you increase your chances of getting nothing but attractive women.
3. When you see an attractive woman, you go up and approach her without the fear of rejection or the hopes of getting her.  All you're doing is shooting your shot.

That's it!

Let's say you approach and average of just 3-5 attractive women a day over a 20-year period.  Your attraction scale goes a little like this:

1. Hot (Extremely attractive)
2. Cute or Pretty (Very Attractive)
3. Fuckable (Mildly Attractive)

This is based off of YOUR standards.  Not your friends,not your work colleagues, and not some article you read about what makes women attractive.  Don't lower your standards lower than fuckable.

Being that these women are all attractive, we will make the success rate just 1%.  So let's say each year you approach 1,500 women a year.

1500 X 1% = 15 attractive women a year

15 attractive women X 20 years = 300 attractive women over a 20-year period

This can all be done with lazy game.  All you have to do is get over the fear of approaching attractive women.  If you count the approach itself as a victory, whether you get her or not, you will play number's game longer.

Let's say over a 20 year period, your success rate increases only 0.5% each  year.

Year 1 = 15  Year 6 = 53  Year 11 = 90  Year 16 = 128

Year 2 = 23  Year 7 = 60  Year 12 = 98  Year 17 = 135

Year 3 = 30  Year 8 = 68  Year 13 = 105  Year 18 = 143

Year 4 = 38  Year 9 = 75  Year 14 = 113  Year 19 = 150

Year 5 = 45  Year 10 = 83  Year 15 = 120  Year 20 = 158

How many is that altogether?  1,730

If your game improved just 0.5% a year over a 20 year period, you would have slept with 1430 more women than if you did lazy game.

What if over this 20 year period, the women were no older than 25 years old like a Leonardo Dicaprio?  What if you were 100% honest about your intentions with all of these women?  This means you told them straight up what kind of relationship you wanted from them.  This includes if all of these were only casual sex partners or one night stands.

How can you make this a reality? All you have to do is make it a habit of going out everyday and approach nothing but attractive women.  Get over the fear of rejection.  Don't worry about getting the girl... trust the number's game process.  Improve your game by being bolder, more solid, and more confident each day you approach.  That's pretty much  it!

""That sounds really good, but I have a deep-seated fear of rejection""

My answer?  Count your rejections as victories just like you would if you actually got the girl.

""I am a virgin.  I don't think I can please a woman sexually""

My answer?  When you have sex with a woman focus on giving her as many orgasms as you can.  If you feel like you're gonna bust a nut, delay your orgasm as long as possible.  Use the stuff you've seen in porn when you have sex.  Put her in positions that makes her have an orgasm no longer than 1-5 minutes of fucking.  Sex starts before the clothes comes off.  By the time the clothes comes off, her pussy is sopping wet and she may have an orgasm in less than 5 minutes of fucking.

I'm not very good-looking.  How the hell am I gonna get nothing but attractive women?""

I based these numbers off of men with lazy game and average-looking doing direct game.  These numbers are ultra conservative.

""How do I overcome the fear of rejection?""

The first approach of the day is a throwaway approach.  You may be weak and timid in your approach.  Simply self-assess and focus on being bolder, more solid, and more confident after each approach.  The first approach is the hardest.  Do one approach a day for a few weeks, then work your way up to 3-5 approaches a day.  Look for venues where a lot of new, attractive women frequent on a daily basis.  Look for venues that have a high population of attractive women.  Take baby steps, and you will progress quickly.

**Problem:** The sex is bad

**Solution:** Be like Eric and do what you want!

**Intro:** Too many people on the internets and IRL complaining about bad sex. Tell you a story about me and my ex wife. We were kids when we got married, and not very experienced. Most of my ""experience"" was from watching porn on VHS at friends' houses. Yes, I'm that old.

Our sex was pretty good - I was always into good sex. But one day I was super horny and wanted porno-style sex, and she was just going through the motions. So I overcame my reluctance to be rejected and told her, ""Straddle me"". She straddled me. I said, ""arch your back and stick your tits in my face."" She arched her back and stuck her tits in my face.  ""Let your head fall back and moan like a whore"" resulted in her rolling her head around moaning like a whore.

It was a revelation. Say what I want, get what I want.

She'll make your coffee how you -tell her - you want it, but gives you starfish in bed? Are you telling her or \*showing\* her what you want? ""Cream and two sugars"". ""Call me Daddy and scratch my back.""

I teach yoga so I'm \*very\* used to telling people how to move their bodies, and sometimes physically showing them through touch. It's not something that is natural to most of us, nor is it comfortable. It took me a while to be easy with it. There's a language we use in yoga, a cadence, a way of speaking. It's a rare occasion when someone says ""no"" to me in a yoga class. I'm in charge, I know what I'm doing and I'm good at it, we establish that at the beginning. They listen and do.

You can practice outside the bedroom with simple things - don't get carried away! - like if you're both walking through a doorway, just say ""you go first"". You're telling her, ever so subtly, what to do. Establish authority early on in the relationship.

The other night I was out at a bar, chatting up some younger model, a nice Jewish girl visiting from out of town, big hooties. Probably 30 years younger than me. She was two chairs over and we were having trouble hearing over the music. Old Do-Not-Read-This would have scooted over a chair to be polite. Instead I pulled out the middle chair, patted the seat and said, ""Move over here so I can hear you"". I'll be darned if she didn't actually \*smile\* when I did that.

(got digits, didn't bang - it was Christmas week and I was too busy so I let it drop)

**Play it like ""Simon Says""**

Likewise, in sex you have to get comfortable telling and showing your woman what you want. Learn the language to be used in bed (I prefer straightforward directions). You're the man, you should be leading her to satisfy your needs. ""Simon Says"".

""Get on your hands and knees. Reach your arms out in front of you. Arch your back and stick your ass up in the air."" It really is that simple. Give her a spank, tell her ""Good girl!"" and stick your hot curly weenie inside of her to claim your reward for being a manly man.

**Show and Tell**

The other part of the equation is to show her. That is, physically move her into position. I'm a couch fucker and a stand up fucker. Those give me the most enjoyment (couches have great angles if you know how to use them). To Move from one to the other, I'll grab the woman's hair tight, tell her ""get up"" while I lift her up, then drag her by the hair into the bathroom where we can fuck standing up. I'll physically put her hands on the vanity counter, grab some more hair and lift her head and tell her to look at herself in the mirror.

So far, 100% success doing this. Women want to be led, and treated like feral animals.

**""She did \[x, y, z\] for Chadley but won't do it for me""**

Are you asking her or telling her what you want? ""Will you please let me maybe please have you know maybe if it's okay have anal please you did it for Chadley why won't you do it for me"" that's what a whiny bitch you sound like. Go back and re-read all of the above.

**Now what?**

If you're new to leading in sex, start small. I would not recommend the couch-to-mirror move for anyone new at the game. Say something simple (and non-vulgar) like if you're in missionary, ""give me your hands"" then grab her wrists over her head. ""Roll on your side"" or ""Get on your knees"". Easy peasy.

Gauge results, calibrate, proceed.

And do what you want to get what you want.",1641735211.0
219,How to get a sixpack before the summer 2022 and put it on tinder to get laid,86,rzrdv1,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rzrdv1/how_to_get_a_sixpack_before_the_summer_2022_and/,76,"Updated-5/10/22 I became a little bit less retard (thanks to brother hamza)

This is a simple guide (for the average skinny fat guy) who wants a six-pack it takes 2-3 months of work for a six-pack.

Also for context, I was sexless for 3 years and now have 6 bodies+a LTR(pretty good didn't work out) just this year now I know it ain't much but it's honest work.

First, get a scale to track your weight. Get a textbook or use your phone to track your macros and calories

Second, look up intermittent fasting. For me, because I was around 178 cutting to 160 made my progress faster and it was way easier to wait to eat the cutout calories completely.

Third, look up your tree calculator to see how many calories you need to cut for cutting its between 250 to 500 calories you need to cut for it. Link down below Also protein is THE MOST IMPORTANT MACRONUTRIENT you want to get at least 1g per pound so I'm 173(I'm 185 not because I'm bulking this is n older post) I try to get 173g of protein before focusing on my fats or carbs. Protein like eggs and PeanutButter also making protein shakes it'll cost you like 100-200 dollars a month just for protein. And finally, for this section take creatine mono to get it on amazon it cost 20-40 bucks 5g over 28 days or 20g over 7 days it's not a drug but looking into it helps and it does get you swole, and help with recovery time from your workouts' Calculator: Learn    your Total Daily Energy Expenditure Calculator: Learn Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure[TDEE Calculator: Learn Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure](https://tdeecalculator.net/)

Fourth Now I'm not the sharpest knife in the crayon box but you have muscles and still need to work out those muscles. So, what works for me look at another post in my profile to get my body so you know I'm not capping. Push/Pull/Leg split 1 day you workout push(chest/triceps).Pull(back/biceps).Legs just legs in general. 5 to 6 days a week that shit gets you big and switching the workouts every day 1 day push other is pull and another is legs. If you don't have a gym lookup home workouts or just the one punch man workout you'll be fine THE LAST PART OF THIS SECTION WORKOUT YOUR ABS FOR 20-30 MINUTES A DAY because I would miss abs a lot and I would rather overwork my body than not work it that hard and go hardcore with that shit that's all it takes.

Edit update 5/10/22- I say work our abs all the time but it's something you should honestly do at first because when starting to work out it's very easy to give yourself excuses to workout. Ex. ah, I went hard today so I think I'll rest tmrw, oh well I slept in I can just do it another day. I think it's in our nature to be lazy nowadays. Of course later down the line when you know without any doubt you can be consistent then yes take your break day but if you just starting you do not deserve a break day until you can be consistent.

Finally, be consistent you do not need to be perfect to start and get the sixpack it took me 3 months before going hard to be consistent you need to just keep going every single day with this and look at the long-term reward from doing this, you get some ass.

And for tinder just post a shirtless pic(the way other posts say on theredpill for tinder)like your friend taking the pic outside and even if you can't do that do a selfie, you'll get fewer results but it'll be something like I went from 1 match a month to 30 matches every 2 weeks brahs don't worry about tinder unless you have a sixpack or dress well you're wasting your time.

TLDR-go back up it's for your benefit

Finally, before this ends, I think this needs to be said. God bless the people on this subreddit who rose and gave advice for people like me and others who didn't know how to get through. Now get to the gym and you should have a sixpack in 2-3 months. Look up info on Zyzz if you need the motivation Good luck Brahs I believe in you.

He actually introduced me to the red pill community about 4 years ago and I'm grateful for having been exposed to the knowledge at an early age because I was making a lot of mistakes beforehand. I went out of my way to improve myself and confidence by going gym, clubs to meet women and worked to get a good paying job, he however doesn't workout, works a low paying job and has no qualifications and I make him come to the clubs to put him in a situation where he could get a women and even tho he could recite everything AMS or sandman and whoever else there has said, he doesn't implement it in his life to improve and to top it off he uses escorts regularly and almost all his earnings from his low paying jobs go to this habit. I don't know what to suggest anymore, yesterday we went to the club and there was this hot girl with a group of girls (3 others) and a male gay best friend, when we saw her we both just said to each other damn, wouldn't mind going for her, but I was the one who did it, I went through her female friends and gay friend and managed to actually start talking and kissing with her, and I tried to get my friend set up with any of the 3 other girls she was with and she sent them to him, it was as if I put it on a fucking silver platter and you know what they told me, ""he's not confident like you are and it's a massive turn off"", I told him this and really wanted to get him another so did and he even fucked that up, brought her a drink and she's making out with someone who looks a lot worse than him. My point is for the whole night he was on the sidelines too afraid to approach and I to take the piss was rubbing it in his face and showing him it's easy with a bit of confidence. The night for him was shit and he said he envied me and was proud of me, I said we were the same, all that I do is approach and take the chances. Tomorrow I'm doing cold approaches with him there to show him it's not scary but I know he won't do any, what can I do to help him, he won't quit porn, escorts, get a better job and it's sad to see",1641679102.0
221,Thoughts/examples on Hypergamy,184,ryzsqf,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ryzsqf/thoughtsexamples_on_hypergamy/,181,"A guy in this sub asked;

>How do you cope with the reality of hypergamy, i.e the fact that the only reason she is with you is because you’re the best available option to her, and that once you’re not the best option anymore your turn is over? (and she's gone to the next guy)

I want your thoughts/views on this. Or examples of some crazy hypergamy you've experienced yourself or observed.

My view is that yes, hypergamy is quite accurate and all women monkeybranch, to an extent, but there's levels (or standard deviations) to this shit. Some will monkeybranch so much, always on to the 'next best thing' that they end up hitting the wall hard & alone as they cannot be in a stable happy relationship long-term. Others will stick with their high school boyfriend for decades.

Between these two extremes there's the 'average' woman. Who, in my view, is not going to ditch their LTR for someone who is 5-10% 'better'. She might leave you for someone that is 50% better if she thinks there's a decent chance she can get with him. But it's unlikely a guy that's 50% better than you is going to be interested in her (Long-term), unless you somehow managed to date completely out of your league (or she's dumb enough to believe he is interested long-term). 

I will say that if you're dating a 8/9/10 hypergamy is probably a larger 'threat' because she's going to get a lot of 'good' offers and your game must be very tight. 

Sure, there are girls who will throw away a LTR to have a ONS with Chad, but those are PartyGirls™ and if you have two eyes you should've seen that coming. 

Finally, to conclude, my view is that a woman is quite unlikely to ditch you for someone better when you are on your grind, making decent money, working out; doing 'your' thing & having tight game. It's only when guys start lacking (becoming complacent/unmotivated, fat, boring; simps) a.k.a. 'lose their edge' that women start to check out and look for other options.",1641648301.0

There is NO WAY to feel comfortable freely expressing yourself unless you have tempered and calibrated your social skills (often at the cost of awkwardness, embarrassment, or anxiety). 

The simple reality of TRP is that it is kinesthetic and experiential. The way your body and face move in concert with your words is equivalent to a muscle, and without the same type of tribulations that make a muscle strong, your kinesthetics will be weak. Likewise, without adequate reference points to our aphorisms, they will remain *meaningless parrot-talk* until you've contextualized them in your own life.

Ever noticed how the great writers and teachers among us, despite the many differences, share a manifest authenticity amongst them?

That obvious authenticity comes from experiences, not analytics. Nobody ever theoried their way into some pussy, they theoried their way into a better way to carry themselves, a better way to manage their internal monologue, a better way to be certain what they're doing was making them fulfilled. 

Moreover, just about everyone worth listening to can express some version of, ""I found this out by going out and failing, then getting better, now I'm sharing it with you all."" Good theory is the result of good hypotheses, which were aggressively tested in real life.

223,"The Laws of Attraction Or Why Doesn’t She Like Me, Man?",145,ry8tbq,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ry8tbq/the_laws_of_attraction_or_why_doesnt_she_like_me/,81,"&#x200B;

Attraction.

This single concept gets more men hung up than any other when it comes to power dynamics and game. For a lot of men, even those familiar with RP terminology, it can be a bit of a boogeyman because attraction is something that goes beyond logic, and so therefore it must be rooted in mysticism. The deeper stuff that Red Pill covers, the cave man shit, is what modern men struggle with the most when taking back their masculinity. You can explain Plate Theory to where it makes sense, but you can’t explain why some hairy, fat guy is able to pull 10s at the bar he goes to night after night. Those kinds of results, which DO stem from attraction in one way or another, can’t be explained logically.

In a way, attraction is mysticism. Attraction is a primal instinct in human beings, so therefore it operates within the realm of emotions. Many men, especially those new to Red Pill, are completely lost when it comes to speaking the emotional language of humans, and are therefore unprepared to deal with and understand the caveman shit that drives woman after woman into your bed.  I will cover the emotional language in a later article but for now, let's talk about attraction.

**So what is attraction?** 

According to Google, attraction is the action or power of evoking interest, pleasure, or liking for someone or something.

Quite interesting that the words “action” and “power” are used in the definition. The definition seems simple enough, so we’ll stick with it.

**Okay, so how does attraction work?**

That is a complicated question. Again, we’re operating in the realm of emotions where the answers, just like the emotions, are a bit fuzzy.

Attraction is an instinct, so it is formed off the basis of survival. You must understand, **attraction can’t be forced.** You can’t say some magic words and POOF!, get somebody, man or woman, to suddenly like you. It is something that is rooted deep within our DNA, formed over generations of our ancestors looking for traits in one another that kept us alive with the ability to procreate.

Those same traits that we looked for in one another thousands of years ago are the same traits we look for in each other today. That’s why even though women are getting fatter and fatter today, we’re not suddenly all into fat chicks to keep up with the times. Attraction doesn’t adapt that quickly, because it is an instinct and it is a part of what keeps us as a species alive.

**So how do I become more attractive?**

Since we’ve established that you can’t force attraction, the good news is you don’t have the pressure of trying to get girls to like you anymore. Qualifying yourself, overthinking how you’re going to strike up conversations, all of that can go away now. Pursuit of women is now about learning how to spot attraction.  I'll break this down further in another article as well down the road.

This is great for you, because it will make the dating game MUCH EASIER. Dating and plates aren’t supposed to be hard or complicated. When done right, women do the work for you. This only works if you pursue women who show signs of high attraction towards you.

If you find there aren’t many women who are attracted to you, it’s because you aren’t the instinctual gratification they’re desiring.

Which means you aren’t polarizing enough.

Polarity as a concept is super easy to understand and gives you a path to follow to find where the attraction in women lies. It’s summed up as such: Whatever women are and whatever it is that they’re doing, be the opposite of that. 

Women (who are worth your time) like things, makeup, being cute and small and feminine, and all the other traits you think about when picturing your ideal woman. Super girly energy, etc. etc.

In reality, women are attracted to the opposites of those things. They like strength, confidence, burliness, body hair, etc. The further you are away from what a woman is, the more attractive to women you will be. 

The single best way to up your attraction level is going to the gym and getting BIGGER and STRONGER. Period. Shredded dudes are nice to look at for women, but when you’re big and strong and hairy and you walk into a room with women, you can FEEL THE ATTRACTION dripping off the walls. They will stare you down and not even realize they’re doing it.  Just my experience, anyways.

**So why do I see all these pretty women with dudes that look like chicks?**

Understand, social conditioning is a strong force to be reckoned with. Look at the toll it’s taken on men, never mind women who are much more easily persuaded by social pressures. Social conditioning is telling men to behave like women and it’s telling women to find men who are soft and super accommodating. 

It’s seemingly working, but if you’re in the 20% club, you know this is all bullshit. A perfect example I can give is my wife.

When we first started dating, she was just another plate I was spinning. She’d just gotten out of a relationship of 5 years with a dude she never wanted to marry or have kids with. He was soft, weak, and super accommodating and she admitted to me she was with him because he would do what she says, but that after a while it got old and boring and she was super unhappy in the relationship.

Once we started hooking up she did everything in her power to make me feel desired and wanted. She knew I was fucking other women and didn’t care. She knew I didn’t love her but she made sure I knew she loved me. She’d go to work, and then come over to my place with her paycheck or her tips to put in my hand and say “Here is your money, enjoy your weekend.” Without me asking. And then I’d send her home and not call her for 3-4 days because I was busy having fun and living my life.

In the end, she was so dedicated to me, and so down for everything I was about, she gave me no other choice.  No other woman could compete with her and once I went exclusive with her, she asked me to marry her.  We have been married for 7 years now and have 3 kids together.  That is difference between soft, accommodating men and the men who are polarizing to women, and that is the difference in devotion you will see and receive.

When you see those soft men with beautiful women, always remember they are on borrowed time. It doesn’t matter how much they appear to be in love, all it takes is the right alpha to come along and turn another guy into a red pill student.

KEY POINTS:

· Attraction can’t be controlled. It’s instinctual.

· Women’s attraction stems from polarity. Be the opposite of women and you will find they are more attracted to you.

· Getting bigger and stronger by hitting the gym is the single most efficient way to showcase your polarity and drive women’s attraction towards you up.",1641566279.0
224,25 To Life - Marriage is a Prison Sentence,239,rxb2s1,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rxb2s1/25_to_life_marriage_is_a_prison_sentence/,127,"We are all aware of Hypergamy, and the effect the feminine imperative has had on society's social conventions leading men to become blue pilled, plugged in and hopelessly hopeful that one day a women will reciprocate the love they feel they deserve. 

Assuming the universal SMV graph is accurate, we can weed out the Blue Pilled men from the Red Pilled.

How many men do you know of who have married an Alpha Widow believing she's saved her best sex for marriage, at the ripe age of 32, coincidentally staring the Wall right in the face? 

I argue that marriage before the age of 38 (for men) is a prison sentence. If you have been enticed into marriage before your SMV peak with a woman at her SMV decline, congratulations, you've enlisted yourself into a sexless marriage while fully satisfying your wife's hypergamous imperatives, maybe she'll name your child Chad, after her alpha widow.

Here's a nifty quote:

I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?
Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness

225,Cold Approaching Starts With Getting Out Of The House Everyday And Making Mistakes,212,rx45om,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rx45om/cold_approaching_starts_with_getting_out_of_the/,45,"I say this to the folks who want to go out and talk to women, but too afraid to even walk up to a woman and say hi.  Don't feel bad.  This little technique is simple, but powerful.  Just get out of the house.  Don't focus on talking to any hot women.  Just go out and find places where hot women will usually be.  This can be the Mall, the park, etc.  Your first goal is just getting out of the house.  If you have to drive out about 30 minutes to an hour to find a spot, go ahead.  This is just to give you an idea of how it feels to get out of the house everyday.  Running errands?  Go to places where you don't frequent and may have a larger pool of attractive women.

You want to wrap your mind around the idea that there's an abundance of hot women everywhere.  You don't have to be out for like 5 hours.  If you cut out travel time, all you really need is about 1-2 hours.

What does this do for you?  It allows you to see that you have more time than you think to go out and talk to women.

Let's say you worked up the courage to approach a hot chick and she rejects you.  You should feel extremely proud of yourself because you broke the fear barrier.  You will notice that rejection feels amazing because you took action.  I feel like crap if I don't approach vs get rejected by making a bold, solid, and confident approach.  Even if it took you 2 hours to approach that one girl, don't feel bad.  You need to condition your brain to get over this fear barrier on a daily basis.

Another simple but powerful tip is to forget about getting the girl, you want to focus on building your confidence first.  It's very important you go to places where there's an abundance of attractive women so you won't feel like if you fuck up, you'll never see another hot woman like that ever again.

At first, you're gonna feel timid and have a lack of confidence.  I would say go out daily and approach 1 woman a day. As you get more confident, approach more and more women a day.  Remember, you're focusing on building confidence, not getting the girl. Something I recommend is talking to women throughout the day to keep your tongue nice and limber.  When you speak to cashiers, engage in a little small talk even if you don't want to fuck her.  Talk to the elderly.  Talk to as many women as possible.  When it's time for you to go to your spot where you approach the women you want, you'll notice how much more fluid you'll be when you talk to these women.

Something else I recommend too is doing self-assessments on your approach.  My goal is to be bold, solid, and confident with each approach.  If I approach a woman and I sound weak and timid when it comes to closing the deal, I am keenly aware of it when it happens and correct this on my next appraoch.  I usually call timid approach a ""warm up"". This is why you want to talk to women all day long so you'll be warmed up already.

To get into the spirit of things, watch cold approach videos or videos talking about game and cold approaching.  A channel I recommend is James Tusk.  His videos show the men getting rejected repeatedly.  This helps you see how resilient some of his clients are and also when they bitch out.  Then you'll see approaches where they get a number or go on an ""insta-date"".

I'm gonna keep it real with you.  You're gonna get rejected... a lot.  This is why I say focus your energy on self-improvement vs. getting the girl.  Focus on finding new places to approach women.  Focus on building your confidence each day you go out.  By doing all this, you'll increase your chances of having a higher success rate as time go on.

Then you'll have those days where  you feel kinda burned out from all the rejection.  Don't feel bad.  Just get out of the house.

226,A Skewed perspective on Women and Cars,62,rx9mby,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rx9mby/a_skewed_perspective_on_women_and_cars/,18,"Bear with me guys.  Unless you're blessed with German humor, you could enjoy my inane rambling and you'll get a good nugget of wisdom in this. **If you can't be bothered then just scroll down to the TL;DR section.**

&#x200B;

When you're young and naïve you can't wait to get into one, and when you do, it's amazing and exciting, but after a while you get used to it. Initially,  you want to test everything and feel an attachment but that passes into familiarity.

It used to be that once you got a car, you'd keep it for life as long as you took care of it. Sure there were guys that upgraded and have more options but your ride was your ride. It broke down. You fixed it. You knew all her quicks and habits. A personality you, if you will.

These days. Guys trade cars often and the attachment can go as high or as low as your personality. 

Your mileage may vary.

A car is also a lot of expenses and being neglectful can cause a lot of stress and greater damages to your wallet. Sometimes forcing you to walk away out of need rather than want.

A car, normally, depreciates in value and is subject to wear and tear from daily use and the more guys drove it, the less appealing it has to any sane person. Normal people don't want to drive a bus.

Cars can become someone's passion and life. An obsession with no end. Upgrade or have a collection. Newest bells and whistles. Features galore!  

Cars aren't all the same. Some are faster, sleeker, newer or have features we like. That  Lamborghini  that you saw in Monte Carlo isn't going to be the same as the Pontiac Aztek parked over two handicapped spots outside of Walmart with it's doors unlocked. 

They both are still cars but if I was to ask you which one smelled like Peter Jackson cigarettes, latex and Little Trees, I'm sure I can guess your answer.

Still. Both are cars.

The better the car the more you need to fork over and invest in time and care. I don't think you'd take a Bentley Bentayga to an automatic wash but after reading some posts and questions here...

Shouts out to the guy who posted a question awhile back about ""What's the most alpha thing to do when someone gives you a gift?"" 

However, some do get a prime choice due to the lotto of birth.  Life's not fair and you play the best hand with the cards you're dealt with. Doesn't mean you shouldn't strive.  It also doesn't mean you can land anything for nothing.

A blind man can't be a pilot. Iggy Pop isn't People's sexiest man alive. You can't go to Caesar's palace with monopoly money. Gotta ground that reality, bud.

Which brings me to the my next point...

Cars, like women, have a cost. You can't expect the best if you don't have something of worth to trade. You need to put the work to get there if you want to drive your dream car (or as close as you can get to it). If you see a new Audi in mint for $2,000 there's either something seriously wrong with the car or it's stolen. It's very likely to explode or breakdown and take you with it.

You also use cars as a flex. But that starts to fad as you get older and stop giving as much of a shit on things people say/think.

Finally, cars can ruin your life and/or kill you if you're reckless. While you can't control if/when something malfunctions and life can fuck with you. Sometimes,  often, that's on **YOU**. If you're not aware and check critical things to maintain that car, it will, most likely, fall apart and it will probably happen when you least expect it.

Now obliviously women aren't fucking cars and this is a shitty metaphor, but just like cars. You shouldn't build your life around them. If you're a woman reading this, I'm not saying you're a machine or just a simple tool. I'm sure you're stunning and brave and this doesn't apply to you. I'm talking about that other friend that you have that you secretly hate. That's right. Her. You can go back to tweeting about 90 day fiancé. 

Any knight reading this can sheath his sword. 

Anyway, where was I? Right. You shouldn't expect that you'll always be in the same car.

Things wear down over time and the worse the build and awareness the faster that occurs.

But there's countless cars out there. They make things easy and fun, and for some a necessity through life, but cars, like women don't define you.

You don't need to build a life tolerating the stress of having a car.

You shouldn't be destroyed when you need to switch.

You shouldn't be afraid to lose your car.

You shouldn't expect it to last forever.

And while you think your car is unique, it's unlikely to be one of a kind in so far as there are others that have qualities that are exact if not better. If you were born in another part of the world in another year, you'd probably have a different outlook.

*I know women aren't cars. While, these days, men can be women and area really good at it, Ford hasn't developed a car that has a gender or sex (although I'm sure it's being worked on).

*No, I'm not a misogynist. I love women.*

*I'm also well aware that this is basic stuff.  Taking her off the pedestal, it's just your turn, abundance, self improvement, men maintain the relationship etc.*

227,The fate of a simp,158,rwna7t,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rwna7t/the_fate_of_a_simp/,149,"I’ve been browsing this subreddit for a long time. When I created a Reddit account I even named it after this sub. That being said, I wasn’t particularly good at following the advice because I felt more like myself being a “nice guy”, so that’s what I did. I wanted to post this as an example of where going down that path can lead you. I now see that the pain of a straight up rejection would have been nothing compared to what I’m going through now. I recently read a post here entitled “she’s not your friend, you’re just a simp” and I wish I’d seen it earlier. Would’ve saved me from so much.

This is a long post (3k words). Maybe everyone’s gonna tell me to fuck off, or maybe nobody will read to begin with. But if I can get even one guy to give up on the blue pill it would be worth it.

There is a tl;dr at the end.

**Meeting “the girl of my dreams”**

I was walking to the library with a friend after a day in my program. We saw another friend sitting outside with a girl. I had seen this girl around, and always thought she was the prettiest. I always looked at her as someone I couldn’t even dream of, someone way out of my league. Just to be in her presence to me would be an accomplishment. Anyway, my friend approached the two of them and struck a conversation with the girl (he’s known her for years). I spoke idly to the other guy in the group, then suddenly she turned to me and asked me a question about something I was wearing. Mind you, I have never even talked to a girl before in my life (other than for work/school, formalities), so naturally I got very nervous. I blushed bright red and fumbled an answer. I was shocked that she even talked to me. After that interaction, I just thought “Oh well, I showed her how much of a pussy I am. I blew it”. 

Every time we would run into her after that, I would sort of avoid her and blush when she talks to me or even comes near me. I just saw myself as inferior. It was horribly disheartening, and I assumed she saw me as a creep by now. But no… this girl would still try to talk to me even though I would give cold replies (out of nervousness), be nice to me, and even asked me to go get a sandwich with her for lunch one time. My stupid fried brain started getting hopeful and thinking maybe this girl liked me. Maybe she saw past my awkwardness and liked my personality. Maybe she liked that I was shy and somewhat “mysterious”. Maybe I had a chance! Oh boy, if only I knew what was in store…

We were basically “friends” at that point, and the three of us (me, her and my friend who’s known her for years) would study together every day. We were preparing for an important exam but none of my focus was on studying and all of it was on daydreaming about this girl. We had a group chat where basically me and the other guy were fighting for the girl’s attention and validation.

After around a month of that, my friend had to travel for some work, so me and the girl were left alone. I was ecstatic about it. Now I could finally have my chance to win her over! 

She was perfect to me. Gorgeous face, tight gym body, sweet, caring, didn’t deal with many guys (LOL), religious in the sense that she wasn’t overly promiscuous (LOL). She even told me one day when we were talking that she is “asexual” and has never really thought about sex and would rather just have guys as friends (yet another day she told me that she had “very high standards for guys” and that she found “big” guys sexy, weird).

Soon enough I was transformed into a full on cuck. I would text her good night and good morning every day, pick her up, take her to appointments, to the beach, buy her coffee, lunch, snacks. And at the end of the day, I would drop her off. I was really happy and felt rewarded when she would say stuff like “you’re the cutest, thank you”. I felt like I was making progress with her. She would make me oatmeal for breakfast some days and I would genuinely feel the happiest I’ve ever felt in my life because I felt that someone actually cared about me. It’s sad how little it takes to make us happy…

It got to the point where my happiness depended on my interaction with her that day. If we had a good time/texted a lot, I would be over the moon. If not (often), I would be miserable.

**Chad comes into the picture**

She really wanted to introduce me to one of her “friends” for some reason (in retrospect she probably wanted to show me that I had no chance with her). She suggested we go get ice cream with him. As soon as I met him, I just felt like shit. Just felt like an ant. Handsome face, square jaw, hunter eyes, nice head of hair and beard and super jacked (he was a bodybuilder). If this guy existed in her life, how could I ever compete? She told me this guy is her “best friend” and that she trusts him more than anyone. He took us to get ice cream and was driving in a crazy manner which she seemed to enjoy. She would tell him which cars were bothering her and he would overtake them in crazy ways which she would find amusing. All this time I’m sitting in the backseat sad af knowing that I have no chance with this girl if this guy is around. In my mind I wondered if they were fucking. He was such a high value guy (rich + politically powerful in the shitty 3rd world country we lived in) on top of his good looks, so there was no way he was just simping like me. She wouldn’t be around if he wasn’t fucking her.

Since I couldn’t compete in the looks department, I tried to be nicer to her, buy her more stuff, give her gifts, wait on her more, compliment her more, treat her like a princess etc. I really thought that this type of behavior would get me places. She invited me to her dorm one time (which I was thrilled about) but then proceeded to cry and tell me how that Chad was being too pushy with her and that they had an argument that led to him ignoring her. I offered her sympathy but deep inside I was happy and hoped that this guy would be gone for good. That night we went to the gym (I got to see her amazing body) had dinner and then just talked till midnight, and it was the happiest night of my life even though I never even got to touch her. I thought I was making progress. “Maybe next time I’ll initiate more physical contact and escalate from there”, I would think to myself.

Two days later she invites me over again at 8 PM. When I get there, I unfortunately see that Chad is there as well. She was cooking some dinner, and Chad kept blurting out weird immature sexual remarks like “when am I gonna eat that taco?!” As well as being very touchy with her. He was letting me know who’s boss. She was giggling and seemed to enjoy it. It just broke my heart as I came to the realization that this girl that I love with all my heart is getting fucked by some asshole. After dinner she was laying on her bed, too lazy to go to the gym so Chad started flipping over the mattress with her on it (to get her to get up) and she was giggling and yelling “Redd_Ghost, please help me!” In a joking manner. I just sat back and smirked because there was nothing I could do to this guy. I was also thinking, how could I ever protect this girl if she was mine? Guys like him would kill me for her. 

We went to the gym after that, and as this guy was lifting, she would pose in front of him in her sports bra and tights with her sexy body to give him “motivation”. He would stare at her with lust like he was going to eat her, while pushing heavy weights. I just felt awkward and out of place, and really didn’t know what to do. Seeing all this was just torture to me, and I just felt like shit and wanted to leave. Of course, I played it cool and acted like I was distracted with my own workout. At the end of the workout we were all doing planks, and when I outlasted Chad in mine he started pushing me down (in a joking manner of course). They were laughing and having a good time but honestly, even though it was a joke I still felt like shit. I felt helpless and small. What am I supposed to do to this guy?? I just thought how I would never put a guy smaller than me down like that, even in a joking manner. I knew it was a self esteem killer. 

After we were done, she told me to wait downstairs in the locker room because she was going to go to her dorm to shower, and that Chad would come get me when she was done. After around 30 min, Chad comes and leads me to her room, where I collect my stuff and leave. She could have just let me take my stuff and leave before she “showered”, but they just couldn’t wait to fuck and/or got off to the idea that some bitch boy was downstairs waiting for them to finish fucking. Anyway, I got in my car and drove home, crying bitterly due to the covert humiliation I felt and because I felt like I wasn’t truly a man. From then, I started going to the gym very regularly. My dream was to have the physique that Chad did and have this girl look at me with desire. My dream was to be like Chad. I couldn’t just accept that genetics and my face had doomed me.

I said to myself, “she will see what a good caring guy I am eventually, I just have to wait”. So, I continued simping. We would “study” together every day, text all night about stupid topics, and I would offer her validation and help with her problems. My life basically revolved around making sure this girl was happy and that her problems were solved. I started neglecting my own life, skipping my courses and duties, and pushing away family and the few friends I had. She would tell me stuff like “I love you”, “you are the best”, “you’re the best guy I’ve met” and it would make my day. She would also tell me stuff like “you don’t need anybody else you have me” which lead to me devoting everything to her and pushing everyone away. I was left with literally nobody but her. It was worth it in my mind, because I really loved this girl and wanted a future with her. So what we weren’t having sex? That would come later. I could just jerk off as I thought about her for now.

Anyway, this shit goes on for a couple more months, I completely mess up this important exam (limiting my career opportunities) because I never really studied properly even though I had plenty of time. After our exams, she moves to another country permanently to further her career. I was supposed to visit that country in around a month for school purposes, so we talked and planned on me visiting her when I came there. The pen pal texting every day thing continued until it was time for me to go to travel. Chad loaded my bag with a bunch of stuff for her (including a framed photo of him and her together, diamond jewelry and so on), and I was on my way…

I rented a car there even though I had never even been in snow and wasn’t that comfortable driving. In my mind I had to do everything and anything to impress her, especially when Chad was offering her so much. I would drive her to work every morning, bring her Starbucks/bubble tea later in the day, then take her for lunch and drop her off home. Everything was paid for by me, but I had no problem with it because I really loved this girl and I felt like she cared about me as well.

**The end game**

One night we stopped by a shop to get cookies. As usual, I told her she could stay in the car while I got the food. She agreed but insisted that she wanted to pay this time and gave me her credit card. She told me to just leave my wallet in the car. I laughed and agreed, putting my wallet (which had $2000 in it. Yes, I carry a lot of money around to impress her) in the cup holder of the car. I went and got the cookies. As we were eating in the car, I caught a glimpse of my wallet, which looked oddly slim. Something didn’t feel right, so I grabbed it and felt that it was way lighter than when I had set it down in the car. I took a glimpse inside and could see that there was barely any money in there. I knew something was wrong but didn’t want to alert her or blame her prematurely, so we just continued on. Later that night after I dropped her off, and after I counted my money and saw how much was missing, I texted her. I told her that $1000 had disappeared from my wallet. She immediately started being defensive even though I didn’t even get to the accusation part yet. When I did she adamantly denied it, swearing up and down, saying she is religious and would never do something like this, and calling me a horrible person for even suspecting her and doubting the way she was raised. I got gaslighted to hell and back and started to think that I’m just crazy. I apologized to her, but she wasn’t hearing it, saying that she will not accept this “offense” and doesn’t want to talk to me again. The next day I met her and was crying telling her how much she meant to me, begging her to stay. That’s right, a guy who just got robbed is begging the thief to stay and keep using him. She told me stuff like “you’re not valuable to me anymore” and “I could make more friends like you in a second, I don’t need you” which really hurt. I begged her so much (I even kissed her hand) that she probably felt sorry for me and agreed to try to work on things. For the next couple days, I continued to drive her to work, to appointments, and to buy her food. She now started treating me like a servant and would put literally 0 effort. She would barely even acknowledge or talk to me; she would just chat with Chad on the phone while I was driving her around. Eventually, with a lot of pushing from my friends and family, I grew some balls and blocked her on everything.

She is the winner. She used up all my resources back when we were in our country. When she moved, she stole money from me and then acted offended that I blamed her and cut me off, effectively getting away with her crime Scott free. Basically, she drained me of everything and after she moved and I was no longer of use to her, she sucked me dry one last time and tossed me aside to deal with the severe emotional trauma. She never “loved” or even gave half a shit about me. I was just useful. It has been 1.5 months and I still think about her and what happened and cry every day. The saddest part is that I still love her.

I was also too much of a pussy to report her theft to the police. I was in a new country and didn’t know what to do. Now I’m back in my country so it’s too late. It’s not like she picked off a couple hundred-dollar bills, this bitch stole $1000. She didn’t care if it was obvious because she knew she would get away with it by manipulating me. Even if I had gone to the police, she probably counted on there being no evidence of her crime. There is a zero percent chance that I win a court case against a pretty female with zero physical evidence. I was fucked either way. Now I’m back rotting in loneliness and misery while she swiftly forgets that I ever existed. $1000 was literally more valuable to her than a human being. Am I even a human being to her? I don’t know.

Please don’t simp. My friend gave me good advice at the start but I ignored it. He said if you are attracted to a girl, either ask her out or ignore her. Don’t be friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

tl;dr: I was bluepilled and thought I had a chance with a very attractive girl by being a nice guy. I was led on and drained of my time, energy, and money for 6 months, was miserable the whole time, blue-balled as fuck, and lost friends as well as opportunities to advance my career in the process. I never even got to touch her while Chad was pounding her the whole time. In the end, when I was no longer useful, I got money ($1000) stolen from my wallet and was essentially told to fuck off.",1641390439.0
228,Why Mastering Stoicism Will Make You Emotionally Unbreakable And Is A Must For Every Man to Practice?,311,rwe9kz,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rwe9kz/why_mastering_stoicism_will_make_you_emotionally/,66,"I wrote this awhile back, and I think I even posted it here. Unfortunately, old account got shadow banned for ""wrong think."" Mastering Stoicism has become more necessary than ever for men. Due to so much uncertainty regarding all that's going on, more loss of freedoms and restrictions by the gov by the day, each day they have some new narrative/propaganda that's going on, which is affecting our lives in one way or another. For example where I live, we are back into crazy dystopian lockdowns. More than 80% of population got vaccinated, and plus with all these implementations of vaccine passports and what not, still we're in a crazy lockdowns which was just announced yesterday. Everything that you can name of, is now closed.




Now first of all, what is Stoicism? Stoicism is the endurance of pain or hardship without the display of feelings and complaint. Most of us, I bet have heard about 3 famous Greek Philosophers. **Aristotle, Socrates and Plato.** But, I want to talk about Stoicism because a lot of people don't know about it, and many confuse it with being emotionless or numb. Nope. That's not what Stoicism is. Stoicism is a philosophy, which was invented in the early 3rd century. Combined with TRP, it can lead to a very incredible and a positive life. It allows you to minimize negative emotions and maximize your gratitude and joy. **There were 3 stoic principal leaders: Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Seneca.**

**Number 1. Emperor Marcus Aurelius** was a big adherent of stoicism and it helped him lead Rome for 2 decades. He wrote many things regarding stoicism in his journals. Stoicism gave Aurelius a huge advantage in life and in his kingship. He lead Rome through many disastrous battles, plagues and through many hardships. But, he always kept his cool and was never negative. He took whatever came at him, in a very stoic and positive way, with the right mind set. 

**Number 2. Epictetus** was born a slave. He founded his own school of Stoicism and thought many great minds, and 1 of them was the future emperor Marcus Aurelius. Epictetus thought everything, not just theoretically, but everything from the philosophy of life, how to handle different situations that we are faced with each day, and greatly, how to Master Stoicism in your day to day life to keep you calm and at peace. **He thought us that, all external events are beyond our control.** We should accept everything that comes to us calmly, because that thing is not in our control. But, however, each individual is solely responsible for their own actions. We cannot blame society or anyone else regarding our own decisions that we partake in. **Each individual is solely responsible for whatever they do, that is in their control.**



**Number 3. Seneca** was a play writer and 1 of Rome's most wisest brokers. He wrote many books on stoicism and was an adviser to Nero (Another Roman emperor). 


**Key principles and beliefs:**

 **Number 1. Live in agreement with nature.** We Men are rational beings. We use our common sense,  logic and practicality in our day to day life unlike women, who base majority of things, off of their emotions and ""how they feel at that exact moment.""

 ""Living in agreement with nature"" simply means, behaving rationally in each and every situation like a logical being. Not basing everything off of emotions.


**Number 2.  Live by virtue.** They make possible ease, self-mastery, and joy in leading a morally principled life. **The four cardinal virtues are prudence, justice, courage and temperance.**


**Number 3. Focus on what you can control, and accept what you can't.** Many things in our day to day life, is in our hands that we can control fully. But, many things aren't. Whether it's the weather, nature of women, politics, all these restrictions, or the clown world, none of this is in our control. So, we shouldn't worry. **We should accept how it is, because even if we worried, what can you do about it? Nothing.** It's not in our control, but what's in our control is, accepting the cold hard facts and leading a virtuous life, which focuses on bettering ourselves, and something which benefits humanity. 



**Number 4. Distinguish between good, bad and indifferent things.** You must acknowledge in your day to day life, between what's right and wrong and indifference doesn't mean coldness. You can't change them (AW-ALT) but take them as they are. 


**Number 5. Take action.** The power to shape your life in whatever way you want, is in YOUR hands. Take this opportunity and take action, and do something positive with it that will benefit you. 


**Number 6. Practice Misfortune.** Ask what can go wrong. For example, if someone was to smoke all their life, what would happen? Lung cancer and many types of diseases and cancers. So, what we do? We tell them not to smoke, because the consequences of their actions will do nothing but harm them. Exact thing we men do. We remind ourselves of the consequences of thinking with what's downstairs, and getting ""emotional"" rather than thinking rationally, and long term. **Just imagine, if all the divorced men whose wives made their lives miserable, were to have all this knowledge?** They would have been way happier and never made the mistakes they did. And now, they live in regret, but at least they realized it. We have to make our brothers aware, and make them wake up before it's too late. Living in the so called ""hope strategy"" will make you nothing but delusional, and it's like your in Lala dream land. The real world doesn't work that way. **As a famous saying goes, ""Iron sharpens iron, so 1 man sharpens one another.""**




  **Number 7. Add a reserve clause to your actions.** True inner peace and happiness is not found in being very rich, or having that very expensive car, or that big house. **That so called ""happiness"" fades away very fast.** Winning is the not the ultimate goal, rather, the ultimate goal is being the best player and playing the best you can, which ironically, will lead to your win. Rather than only thinking of winning and drowning in self confidence, which in the end, does more harm than good. It's good to have high self confidence, but always remember to be in your limits. **Your victories and over confidence can lead to your destruction.** The point is, always remain humble.



  **Number 8. Love everything that happens (Amor fati).** Now let's say something happened that we didn't wish for. What would happen? You either accept it or live in negative thoughts, which affects your mental health. What's the more wiser option? Accept it. Stoicism calls this, ""The art of acquiescence."" The first step is to accept it, and then the next step is to love everything that happens. Why? Because those things ultimately are not in our control. 



**Number 9. Turn Obstacles into opportunities.** You know why most people are always negative? **They see obstacles as barriers and live in this deception, that they cannot overcome it.** There are many instances in life, that you can turn those obstacles into opportunities for your own success. But you know what the catch is? Being stoic, and thinking everything through from all fronts and then analyzing everything and then coming to conclusions, will eventually lead you to success. This ""art"" many cannot do. Most people are a slave to their emotions, and never be that. Be rational, thus be stoic. 



**Number 10. Be mindful.** In this life, you have the power over your emotions, no matter what those emotions maybe. You must remember, any emotion that you get, will either do you good or bad. **1 of my favorite sayings of all time is ""Before thinking of a short term gain, first think of it's long term affects.""** You must master the art of controlling your emotions, and being practical and logical no matter what. And rather thinking of the short term gain, first think of the long term affects of that action. 


 In the end brothers, it's AWALT and that is not in our hands. **But what is in our hands is, how we accept it. And the best thing a man can do in the modern age is focus on himself**, do good in whatever he can, and Master Stoicism in whatever life throws at him. And being always very sharp of his surroundings and Mastering Machiavellianism.


As they say, never be so nice that people take advantage of you, and never be so harsh that they only fear you. Balance is key, and now, this is were Machiavellianism comes in. **You must function through life based on the tactics that apply in each and every aspect of your life. This is were intellect and common sense comes** in, and unfortunately, many lack of it, no matter if they have more ""degrees"" than a thermometer. 

**In conclusion my brother's, no one is going to help you function through this clown and circus world. In the end, it's only you. And you have to accept that harsh reality, before your life becomes miserable, because you stayed in that delusional fantasy. Remain that person, who is always stoic and who is unbreakable no matter what life throws at him.**



 Some famous stoic sayings: 

**The best revenge is not to be like your enemy. Marcus Aurelius. Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be One.** — Marcus Aurelius 

**You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.**—Marcus Aurelius 


**He who fears death will never do anything worth of a man who is alive.**—Seneca 



**Life is very short and anxious for those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear the future.—Seneca You have power over your mind — not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.**―Marcus Aurelius 


**Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants**.―Epictetus 


**True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not**. ―Seneca

The radio is a great example of how broad reach directly translates to results.

Let’s examine what happens when you buy a radio ad. Even if your radio Ad has a 1% conversion rate, it might still be profitable because the reach is so high. So many people have to listen to the radio on their morning commute and at least some of those people will be buyers.

For women, we don’t even need to create a profitable campaign. We just need to approach enough of them through online dating or cold approach and eventually one of them will be down to fuck.

Magnets are another great example of how polarization leads to results. There’s a feminine side and a masculine side to everything.

And as you know with magnets, opposites attract.

You must learn to cultivate a masculine energy in order to attract feminine energies. The more masculine you are, the more powerfully women will be attracted.

All in all, the key to success is to be a magnetic radio, broadcasting your masculinity to a big enough audience to generate good results with women.

230,How To Get Past The Anger Phase,118,rvcdpe,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rvcdpe/how_to_get_past_the_anger_phase/,35,"Hey TRP.  Long time member, and a small time men's coach here.  Been doing this for 10 years and have helped many men unwind themselves from their blue pill mindsets to become more successful and confident in life.  One of the hardest thing any man who stumbles upon the Red Pill will have to deal with is the motherfucking motherfucker of all stages, and that is the Anger Phase.  It is the most difficult, and longest stage you will go through as a man on his Red Pill Journey.

Why?

There are a number of reasons, but the most enlightening of them all is this harsh reality.  YOU ARE STILL BLUE PILLED.   If you have animosity towards women, or this ""All women are bitches and sluts"" type of thought process, it's ONLY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT THE MAN WOMEN DESIRE, you're an 80%'er and therefore still a Blue Pilled crab.  You are on one side of the playground where the playground equipment is crowded, run down, and there is a lot of trash on the ground because city services doesn't bother to come clean it up.  A dude who gets women and finds himself successful in life and relationships doesn't have this mentality.  Women are a POSITIVE EXPERIENCE for him, as men who are very successful with women ENJOY THEIR COMPANY because those women work hard to make his life better.  The ""all women are sluts"" mentality doesn't even cross his mind because when you have abundance and choices, you have a completely different experience with women than dudes who have to rummage through the trash.  Those men get to enjoy the experiences of how far a woman will go to please him, and the last thing it does is anger him.  This is the difference between dudes who read the articles and memorize the buzz-words, and those who do the work to internalize it.

Something so many dudes don't understand is, HYPERGAMY ISN'T PERSONAL.  It's not about you.  Just like everything else about women as individuals, it's all about THEM.  Hypergamy is just a process of human nature, and it DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T BE THE DESIRED OUTCOME OF A WOMAN'S HYPERGAMY.  HYPERGAMY isn't your enemy.  In reality, it's a tool you can use to hone in on the desires of women and optimize your time to become those things... which many men find line up with what they want for themselves as well.  And the best news is that you don't even need to reach the pinnacle of existence as a man to keep a harem of beautiful women knocking on your door and blowing up your phone.

Now as for how you get past the anger phase?  It's simple, but incredibly difficult.  You have to gain some self awareness and find out where you're at in the pecking order.  Acknowledge you aren't what women want and then shut the fuck up about it, and about women, and get to work.  The work will move you past the anger phase as you become more attractive.  

I'll give you an example.  When I was 18, I weighed 120lbs.  I couldn't bench press 90 lbs when I joined the military.  I occasionally got laid, simply because I was funny and charming, and I lived in a college town next to a party house so convenience was on my side too.  But this happened rarely, and I had to work my ass off to get women to warm up to me.

Cut to me now at 32.  Been in the military for a long time, and while in I started lifting.  I've got a 300lb bench press, 365lb ass to grass pause squat, and a 465lb dead lift.  I weigh 205 lbs and I'm covered in tattoos.  Simply being big and strong compared to when I was 18 has allowed me to see what the other side of the playground is like.  Women bump into me at bars to try and start conversation.  They write their phone numbers on napkins and place it in front of me when I'm out eating dinner.  They let me get away with saying inappropriate stuff to them.  They do all the hard work for me.

How can I be angry with women who go out of their way to be nice to me, to give me their attention, their desire, their passion?  And that's the point.  That's what separates most men who stumble upon the Red Pill from those who live it.  The Red Pill will set you free, but it's a motherfucker to get there.  

You have to do the work to get past the anger phase.  Acknowledging you're not what women want, BUT ONE DAY YOU CAN BE, that's the ticket to leaving all that anger and frustration behind.  Lifting, social skills, grooming, dressing better, being ambitious (not even necessarily successful as Will Smith illustrates).  Stop holding onto your blue pill anger and hate.  It's weak.  And it will NEVER make you feel better.",1641244877.0

Think about all the times that you spent about caring what he/she/others will think about me, and valuing others opinions over yours. Think about all those moments, where you sacrificed what you wanted to say just so others can, to make them feel ""better."" **Just think about all the times, where you have made your life decisions and choices (whether it's of your career, your clothing, your lifestyle, your thinking, views and mentality) based on what people will say about you.** Just think about how much time you have wasted on all of this vs rather doing what you want to do.

**Now, think about one thing. All these people's opinions that you cared so much for, if you were to die today and be put in your grave, will any of these people ponder over your death, for even a minute? Just think about it. I can bet you, while you have sacrificed your life away in pleasing people, majority of them will not care if you die. They will simply go on with their lives, while you? You're dead.**

The people that you tried so hard to impress and made them a priority, were are they now? They are all gone. In today's selfish world, you cannot put others above you. Whether it's women, friends, or anything. Otherwise, you'll be left behind. You must remember society or anyone, they do not gaf about you. In the end, YOU have to make something of this life, and get ahead in anyway possible you can. **Because in the end, it's just you.** Since the beginning of time, it has only been survival of the fittest, and never survival of the unfittest. Nobody can help you, except yourself.

You being the so called ""politically correct guy"" in order to ""fit in"" with society, or being the so called ""male fèminíst"" in order to attract women, or reading some random article on, ""How to act alpha to get women"" or whatever, will only do you more harm than any good. Remember, fake attracts fake. Real attracts real. 

Acting someone that you're not, trying to be someone that you can't be, just in hopes to ""please"" the people will in the end, do you nothing. Just think about it. If someone can't defend themselves, and their whole lives revolves around in being a people pleaser and a fake, **how will they be able to lead anyone? How can they gain the trust of anyone, if they're fake to their own selves?**

Majority of the people have this idea that, if they become ""PC"" that they'll be accepted in society. While this may be true, the reality is, you will never be deeply respected by anyone. I disagree with many people, but I still respect them because they're being themselves and they don't suck up to anyone. But the reality is, majority of the people follow an agenda. Yes. **They follow what society wants them to do and be, and they suppress their own desires in order to follow what they (society/elite/random strangers) want.** I rather have 2 people that genuinely respect me for my views, vs having 100 fake people who say they ""respect"" me, but they're also fake like you. Negativity and fake, attracts the same types of people.

Just think about it. **If you have an open enemy who says he ""hates"" you, versus having a so called ""friend"" who says he's your friend, but he backstabs you when you were least expecting it, because you 'thought' he was your ""friend.""** What hurts more? Of course, the hypocrisy of your so called ""friend"" who was acting like it, while your enemy? You openly knew he was an enemy. Hypocrisy is far worse then being brutally upfront and honest.


The point is gentlemen, don't conform to the expectations of society and people have of you. **No matter what you do you in your life, whether it's good, bad or anything, everyone will always have something to say.** You cannot please everyone and you cannot keep them all happy. If you do this, people will then ask, ""Why didn't you do that?"" If you do that, then they will ask, ""Why didn't you do this?"" **The number 1 mistake that most men make is, they sacrifice their own ambitions and goals to please others, while forgetting themselves. And by the time they wake up and realize all this, it's too late.** And, all the people they wanted to impress never cared anyway. Because certainly in today's world, who has the time to? 

1 of My favorite quotes of all time is from the Movie Wall Street. Where 1 of the character says, ""**Man looks in the abyss, and there's nothing staring back at him. At that moment, man finds his character. And that is what keeps him out of the abyss.""** Indeed. Only when we look at the abyss, that's when we reflect and realize how much delusion we were in.

 In conclusion gentlemen, don't put your purpose of life in what others want you to do and achieve. Rather, do what you have to do. Of course, on the journey to find your inner peace and happiness you will overcome many obstacles, pain and suffering. **But what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger.** And whatever you may face, it will only add on to the list of experiences in life which you will learn from. Take advice from gentlemen that you consider wise, and always keep an open mind. Because there is always something to learn from someone. There will always be a person smarter, stronger and wealthier than you. Don't let your ego come in the way, making you lose valuable wisdom that you may gain. **In the end, listen to everyone, extract all the knowledge you possibly can, and live life on your own terms. Never let anyone dictate how you live your life, and never take shi from anyone.**",1641184991.0

Ok, fellas, I hope you feel as good as I do today.  If not I am sure that you will soon.  While generally I dislike the whole “New Year, New You” nonsense, I am going to deal out some New Year advice. 


These are the four things to remember as you set out in life, younglings.  


**I.  Fitness.**


As an OG, and former college athlete, I can tell you that it will never be easier for you to get in shape than it is right now.  As you get older, it will not be easier.  Quite the opposite in fact.  So lift, eat clean and stay the fuck away from things that will age you, like drugs, cigs, too much booze and, for older guys, women your own age.  All of that shit that you do to yourself comes back to your face in your 40s.

Bodies are built in the kitchen.  85% of shit that goes wrong in your fitness plan is stuff that you put in your mouth.  **You cannot outrun your mouth.**  Also, **proper dental care is important.**  A lot of health problems originate from poor oral hygiene.

For guys still in school, I recommend playing at least one team sport and one individual sport, whether it’s pick-up basketball, co-rec flag football, whatever. The first teaches you teamwork and the second self-reliance.  

Also, learn to swim.  When you’re old and your knees and whatever else are fucked up, you will still be able to swim for exercise.

Be open to alternative medicine.  Not exclusively, but when I moved in January, I had smth go wrong in one of my legs and I thought, *“If I go to an allopath, he’s just going to give me a pill.”*  So I rolled the dice on a chiropractor that had the best online reviews, and he basically said, *“What you have is this, and I can fix it in 3 or 4 visits,”* which he did.  I get adjusted periodically and I also get a massage once a week.  It makes a world of difference.  I also got a Traumeel injection instead of Cortisone for some bursitis.  Effective almost immediately – I went from “crippling pain” to 99% of normal – and without the nasty side effects.  

Also, stay the fuck away from statins if at all possible.  They are a fucking nightmare.  Minimize the pills, minimize the side-effects. They have their uses, ofc, but Big Pharma doesn’t make money off you being healthy.  Still do what you feel is best for your situation, but just be open to other things.



**II.  Finances.**

So there is lots going on in the TRP space about finances.  As Arthur Ashe famously said, *“Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can.”*  Get your shit in order.  Save the first 10% that hits your hand.  You won’t miss it.  Avoid consumer debt.  You are paying for depreciating assets that way.  

Cheap money, which is what we have as we approach the end of our long-term debt cycle, gets people in trouble.  Sure, there are some guys who use leverage – and this advice is not for them – but most dudes get into trouble.  

You need to get on your grind, and focus on your grind, and keep focusing on your grind.  You should be working on making contacts, building relationships, accessing capital and putting everything back into your business.

Sure, I wrote *CorporateLand* for guys who were going to live in that world – as I have – but the goal for most guys should be to get in, get experience, make contacts, get some capital, and get gone.  

Now, it might be fairly said, *“Why did you stay in CorporateLand so long Vaz?”*  My skills are specialized and well-compensated.  And I remade my gig how I wanted it to be.  Sure, lots of folks have been working at home in the time of COVID, but I have been doing that for more than ten years.  Now, of late, things have changed.  I’m doing more work, have less free time, and if they don’t start showing me the love, I may have to show myself out.

The problem for most guys is, they don’t have an exit strategy.  It’s easy to get fat, dumb and happy on a corporate paycheck, and lose your edge.  I made plans and will pull the ripcord when I’m ready to.  

Always remember, whether it’s with women or work, they can’t fuck with you if you have options.



**III.  Fun.**

This one is up to you.  For me, writing, playing, recording and performing music is Pure Joy.  I also enjoy art, beach volleyball, and bouncing around Europe, whether that’s in the Ancient *Rodina*, hiking in Switzerland, sunning myself (or rather chilling in the shade while some naked young women sun themselves) in Greece, or relaxing in cafes in the broken gleams of the golden light of the Riviera.  You may enjoy jujitsu, or flying planes or other stuff.  It’s not up to me, it’s up to you. 

Very often, whatever your hobbies are will become your girlfriend’s hobbies, or at least she will develop a passing interest in them.  So if you meet a girl who is super into muscle cars, now you know what her HS boyfriend was into.  Or her dad, either way.

You can use hobbies to meet girls, ofc, although I would emphasize you should choose ones that you like.  I play co-rec beach volleyball (although not lately, really) and that means that approximately half of the players are going to be girls and some of them are going to be hot, and almost all young.  Matronly, dumpy 50 year-old single moms are not out playing beach volleyball.  If there’s some over lap with young, hot women, great, although really that should not be the primary focus.

Have some that are active, some that are low-key active and some that are more mental in aspect.  So higher speed athletics are fun, but you won’t be doing those as much as you age, but you still want to stay active thus swimming and hiking as I mentioned.  

The girl I referred to as the Hotness in **[Uncle Vasya’s Guide On Dating Models](http://archive.is/KugYG)** was a chess master, and I wish I could have given her a run for her money when we played.  She mentioned this once, also, and I replied, *“So tell me, exactly how many chess nerds have you ever fucked?”* Her: *“None.”*   Me:  *“Exactly. And checkmate.”*  Her: *“{Stinky bitter face.}”*  

I do, however, collect and enjoy wines.  Every single time we were out to dinner with others she would brag about me being a wine expert.  Every. Single. Time.  




**IV.  Fucking.**

As and after you handle the above, you should gain experience in chatting up, bedding and spinning plates, or, if you choose, entering into OLTR.  Toward that end, I include some openers some of which are my own design, and some of which are not, as well as some entries from m “Chatting Her Up” series.  Enjoy.


*“Did you invite all of these people?  I thought it was just going to be the two of us.”*


*“You look lovely…shall we get drunk together?”*


*“I could see us falling madly into bed together.”*


*“I’m here.  What are your other two wishes?”*


^ Total cheese, but you know if you can pull this off.


*“Here, feel this fabric (of your shirt).  You know what this is?  Boyfriend material.”*


*“Look, I’m going to go hang out with my friends, but since were’ going to fuck after the party, why don’t you give me your number now?”*


*“I think you should call your boyfriend, and dump him.”*


^ Retort to the *“I have a boyfriend,”* gambit, if she plays it.


*“You will remember tonight as the night you fell in love with me.”*


*“Let’s go somewhere private, so we can mess around n’stuff.”*


*“So I’m going to do dirty, sexy, crazy things to you.  And you’re going to love me for it.”*


*“So I noticed you, noticing me.”*

It is the New Year’s Eve, or for others it is the New Year’s Day. Some will want to make resolutions, change their bad habits or write a little motto like New Year new me. We all know that it's often just words and actions and it only takes a few weeks or even a day before the good intentions towards oneself are completely stopped.

I will try to explain to you why we want and like to do something, how psychologically we can help ourselves to keep the good habits or to fix the bad ones. The main concept will be the dopamine detox that I will call DD. All this knowledge can be useful if you want to be more alive, be more in the moment, control your desires or be more productive and happy.

Before going into details I would like to say that I am a student who will graduate in psychology in less than 6 months, so all the information that will be given comes from reliable sources, but I still advise you to do your research if the subject interests you.

# Research

The problem with dopamine detox, which I want everyone to understand, is that dopamine detox has not really been studied. There are no clinical trials on dopamine detox. Everything I'm going to share is based on neuroscience, its clinical work.

&#x200B;

  

# Inquiry

  

How do the neurotransmitters, dopamine, actually work? We can actually elucidate what is going on in a dopamine-tolerant brain. Like what goes on in the mind of someone who plays video games. We can even hypothesize based on what's going on what's going on in the brain's circuitry. So what does dopamine actually do in the brain?

&#x200B;

  

# Neuroscience

  

**Dopamine pathway** (https://imgur.com/a/aZWXfAE)

The dopamine pathways in the brain, the ones we will examine are the **mesocortical** and **mesolimbic**, and the VTA is also important. These three parts of the brain are sort of where the reward, behavioral and motivational dopamine circuits are located. Dopamine is involved in the feeling of pleasure. Dopamine is the reward, the neurotransmitter that our brain uses to reinforce a behavior in the first place. It is therefore not necessarily the feeling of pleasure because, as we will discover, hedonism and motivation are in fact two distinct neurochemical circuits.

**Hedonics** is the ability to experience pleasure and **dopamine** is involved in motivation and reward. When we engage in a behavior that that rewards us in some way, this reinforcement is going to be via dopamine and the two pathways that we are going to examine the most are the mesocortical and especially the mesolimbic pathway. The mesolimbic pathway is involved in reward-related cognition, which includes the salience of incentives.

**Wanting** and **enjoying** are actually not the same part of the brain. (https://imgur.com/a/WD5WNVB )

Dopamine is what makes us want things. Craving and pleasure are involved in the mesolimbic pathway but there is actually a separate circuit that involves it more. It also has to do with **aversion** and positive reinforcement. What aversive cognition means is that is that basically, if you avoid things, you can reward behaviors with aversion as well.

Simple example : *If I don't ask anyone out or if I don't go on a date, I'll be peaceful because I'm afraid to go on a date, I'm afraid of being lonely, I'm afraid of all that.*

Dopamine is involved in this type of motivational circuit, as is avoidance motivation. The mesocortical pathway is a little different because it involves **executive function**. Our mesolimbic pathway, the pathway that goes from the ventral label mental area to the nucleus accumbens, this pathway is really around motivation and reward.

Note that our frontal cortices are the ones that give us a sense of control and willpower.

Executive function is the ability to plan out a task over time and execute on those pieces.

Simple example: *If i want to find a job that involves polishing up my resume it involves updating my linkedin profile if it involves like these other kinds of things then applying to jobs responding to emails sending you thank you notes after interviews*.

All of these things are essentially executive functions and if you really look at it, the key thing about dopamine here is that this circuit is **not rewarded** for each of these steps, so the mesocortical pathway is the one that allows us to take action **without being rewarded** at each step, so when I update my resume, I don't get dopamine, so if I apply for jobs, like updating my LinkedIn profile, I don't get dopamine, and yet our brains are able to perform essentially long-term tasks that are not immediately rewarding.

Long-term tasks that are not immediately rewarding are governed by the mesocortical pathway. What we actually find is that when people are overly dopaminergic, when their mesolimbic pathway dominates their mesocortical pathway, **you end up with people who are unable to engage in any action that is not immediately rewarding**, it's kind of like they can't do what they should be doing and they can only do what they want to do...

**The anterior cingulate cortex** is involved in what is called effort calculation. This effort calculation means that every time we do something, this is the anterior cingulate cortex. It says to itself “OK, I can do this and get this reward, it takes a lot of energy for this kind of reward or I can invest a lot of energy for a big reward or I can invest a lot of energy for a small reward or I can invest very little energy for a big reward” 

Simple example: *I can spend 10 years becoming a doctor, which is a lot of effort and a high reward. I can even do things that my mind will tell me like ""oh, there's no point in asking this person out because they'll never say yes"", that's a low reward, high effort strategy, and there are even things that are high reward, low effort strategies like ""I'm going to spend all my money on Tesla"".*

The anterior cingulate cortex is involved in all of these effort calculations and what essentially happens is that when we have defective dopamine neurons in the nucleus accumbens (the nucleus accumbens is in the mesolimbic pathway), it changes the effect of our anterior cingulate cortex. When this happens, **we are essentially unable to choose anything other than the ""low reward, low effort"" option.**

Let's recap for a second. Dopamine is a diverse structure that does all sorts of things in our brain, like motivation, reward, executive function and even things like movement. When we look at motivation, reward, it's what we call the mesolimbic pathway and when we look at executive function, it's the mesocortical. The limbic system is our emotional brain circuit. The cortices are our frontal lobes.

**Mesocortical is planning**

**The mesolimbic rewards behavior**

There is sometimes a tension where the mesolimbic beats the mesocortical reward.

This means that **we will choose a reward behavior rather than plan and execute tasks over long periods of time**. If we meditate, what we can do is reverse, because we improve our cortical circuitry, we will be able to do planned actions rather than immediately rewarding actions.

Additional note: *The frontal cortex is involved in things like impulse control. ADHD is deficient in both of these pathways, particularly in the mesocortical pathway more than the mesolimbic pathway.*

The anterior cingulate cortex involves the calculation of effort.

Sometimes your mind tells you it's not worth it and when you dopamine system here, it will actually disrupt the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior cingulate cortex and disrupt the effort calculation. When you impair the dopamine, the only choice you can make is to make a **low effort for a low reward**. When we disrupt our anterior cingulate cortex, that's the only quadrant in which we can do things, we can't afford to do anything that involves high effort for high reward.

&#x200B;

  

# The diagnosis 

  

What we usually see in a dopamine detox is basically that is that people get stuck in this particular pattern. What is the neuroscientific correlation to all of these things? What does that mean and how is it going to present itself clinically?

**The things you are motivated to do are not fun**. It's critical, because essentially what's happening is that our mesolimbic pathway is sort of active, but something in our reward circuitry builds up a tolerance. It's not really fun. The other thing that happens is that there's this war between the mesocortical and the mesolimbic. The second characteristic that determines if your dopamine circuits is messed up is when **you should be doing something but you can't**. That weird basal mesolimbic circuitry ends up being stronger than the mesocortical circuitry, which means that the part of your brain that tells you these are the planned actions that I should do, that I have to do them this way, loses out to the immediately rewarding behavior. The last sign is that **the things that other people are very motivated for are difficult for you**. These are the three signs that you need a dopamine detox. 

There seems to be a high degree of compulsion towards a behavior that is not pleasurable. What happens is that part of your brain, and that's why it's important to understand that **dopamine is not just a pleasure chemical**, because you would think that if it was just a pleasure chemical and you didn't feel pleasure anymore, then you wouldn't engage in that behavior anymore. If you don't like playing video games, why on earth would you play Fortnine for 10 hours a day and get frustrated every time? It's kind of weird, so we have to understand that dopamine is not just a pleasure chemical, because if it was a pleasure chemical and I was motivated by a behavior and that behavior wasn't fun, then I would no longer be motivated by that behavior. So that means that there are two different circuits in the brain and like dopamine, it can reinforce behaviors without necessarily leading to pleasure, and that's this discrepancy. What's happening is that your mesolimbic circuitry is active and pushing you towards a particular behavior, but your ability to experience pleasure from it has developed a sense of tolerance.

Dopamine detox has nothing to do with your dopamine levels, **it has everything to do with your dopamine receptors**. Basically, this is what happens in a brain. You have a neuron that releases a chemical signal into the synaptic cleft and in the synaptic cleft you have on the other side a neuron that has receptors. What happens is that you release a neurotransmitter from one neuron and it moves to the next neuron and activates the signal. If you release a large amount of signal, the receptor neuron thinks ""I'm getting too much signal"" and downregulates the receptor end of the receptor.

A simple example: *when you start drinking caffeine, it can keep you up all night, but if you drink it every day, you develop a chemical dependency, which means you regulate your caffeine receptors in your brain, so if you want to stay up all night with caffeine, you actually have to drink more.*

In fact, the more signals you pour into your brain, the more your brain will down regulate those signals. When people say you need 24 hours to reset dopamine level, that's not true, if you do that for 24 hours, 24 hours won't do anything, because the neurophysiology of what's going on is receptor adaptation, receptor adaptation takes weeks to balance, so if you think if you stop caffeine for 24 to 36 hours, you're not going to be detoxed from caffeine, you're just going to be miserable for 24 hours and you're not going to be totally fine. If you also think about alcohol addiction, for example, alcohol addiction can take five to six days just for medical reasons.

**For dopamine detox, the goal is to fix that receptor regulation**. When you bombard your mind with dopamine with things like video games and technology, you go on reddit or any kind of social media, you don't even think about it. That's the problem. You're not thinking ""oh I'm really going to enjoy doing this, like wow I can't wait to jump on reddit today.""

It's like my mind is bored, boredom or that there's some kind of a void in what I'm doing. My mind reflexively goes to social media or Reddit or something and I click on the meme and I get this quickie, this quickie... this quickie this quickie it's not really fun, it's not like when you go on vacation, you don't think ""oh man, that this would be so great to spend six hours a day on the internet surfing Tiktok"", you don't feel like doing it, but it still reinforces in a way.

It's not really a craving, it's a kind of neuroscientific mechanism that's reinforced by behavior. Which is active and we have that quick dopamine hit, we have that quick dopamine hit, we have that quick dopamine hit. What we want to do through a dopamine detox is reset our levels because what happens is when you play a video game for 10 hours a day, you get a constant flow of dopamine, that constant flow of dopamine will downregulate your dopamine receptors. If our dopamine receptors are downregulated, we enjoy things less, but something strange happens because the reinforcement circuitry, the behavioral circuitry seems to stay intact and that has something to do with probably other neurotransmitters and things like that, like the endocannabinoid system and habit formation.

Basically what happens is that when you have a constant flow of dopamine.

Like if I drink coffee throughout the day, my brain will adapt to that level and downregulate my dopamine receptors, and then you get into this situation where now that my dopamine receptors are downregulated, other activities start to feel less enjoyable, because if you think about the effect of dopamine. Reading a book or going for a walk, those things start to feel less enjoyable, so that's the next thing to think about when you need a dopamine detox: are the activities that normal people seem to enjoy not very enjoyable for you? If the answer is yes, then you need a dopamine detox.

Just to summarize. What we're looking for in dopamine is if your life has a constant flow of dopamine and what we we're talking about the use of video games social media use, these are the things that bombard your brain with dopamine, so if that's the case and you find yourself in this clinical presentation of feeling compelled or compulsive behavior. That doesn't really lead to pleasure. So if you're playing video games for 10 hours a day and you're not really enjoying yourself. You may need a dopamine detox, if you spend a lot of time on social media and you're not having fun, you may need a dopamine detox, pornography could absolutely be one of them.

You feel compelled to do something but you don't enjoy it; things that other people tend to be able to do or enjoy that you can't enjoy; you may be considering a dopamine detox; and finally, the last thing is some sort of inability to control the part of your mind that is or there is a war between what you know you should be doing but you end up going to the compulsive behaviors over and over and over again; this is the third sign.

&#x200B;

  

# The intervention

&#x200B;

  You need at least two weeks of dopamine detox to see significant results. During these two weeks, you must be prepared to be bored, schedule something to fill the void and avoid temptation. The program can be anything: walking, reading a book, exercising, cleaning, shopping, cooking, playing an instrument, coding, learning a skill, vacation, nature, travel, outdoors, etc. Scheduling and active media consumption is allowed, such as watching a movie a day or listening to music. Like when you know you are there and not in the clouds. Passive mindless consumption is not allowed: scrolling SM, watching Netflix on a loop or anything zombie-like. No video games, replace them with board games. Go out, socialize, live your life. You can always keep what you do a secret to avoid relapse. Sometimes peer pressure is the worst thing. It’s okay if you relapse for 5 minutes, the important thing is to get back on track and not give up, stay consistent and resilient. I challenge you to try to keep up with me. I start my dopamine detox on the 1st and it will end on the 14th. It's a great way to start the year and be happier and more productive. Who’s with me?

Here's a simple guide:

**Realize that you're not alone**

You aren't not the first person to feel like this. You're not the last. As you read this there are other men currently going through this. They'll live so will you.

You are not identified by your relationship You existed before your relationship and will exist afterwards.

**She's moved on**

Not that it matters, but she's moved on or will very quickly. Don't entertain the notion that she's sitting by the phone waiting for you. She's more likely to spite fuck or ""slut it up"".

**Lift**

This is said a lot but only an idiot would argue against working out and proper diet. Not only do you increase your prospects for a new woman but it keeps you busy...

**Keep busy**

An idle mind drifts and it'll drift to something familiar.

**Burn that bridge**

You don't need her phone number, her old photos, that shirt. If you can burn it do it. Not sure why but there's some powerful symbolism.

**Don't move on to the next chick**

Take the time to reflect and grow. You don't need a relationship. Fuck around but work on yourself. Going from relationship A to relationships B won't give you time to reflect, change or do anything.

**Avoid drugs and alcohol**

Seriously don't need to explain that.

**It's OK to be sad**

You're not a machine. Process the emotions alone, behind closed doors or with a close, trusted male friend. Then move on.

**It's OK to be alone**

You don't need to have a partner. You don't need to get laid all the time. You don't need cohabitation. You do you.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'll leave it at that. Anyone want to give tips feel free to add to the list.

See you guys in 2022.

Edit: Man this kinda blew up. Forgot how many break ups occur in December.

 Hang in there fellas.

***Edit: Few things I didn't think that I needed to add:***

1. *Focus of this post is for YOU. Only one item on this list mentions the girl. The rest are about YOU and how you handle it. The gist is acceptance of your emotion and allowing yourself time to process it, objective reflection, perseverance  through masculine comradery, self improvement, and stoicism. It also switches the perspective from loss and regret/pain to opportunity, and growth. Most of these things can be for any other jarring/emotionally taxing event.*
2. *There's a few Chads in here who were calling this a BP post. Something about if you're thinking of her then you're not truly RP. I must apologize to these paragons of masculinity and stoicism for somehow forcing them to read this guide that's clearly not for them. While I agree that if you're upgrading your life and have success, you shouldn't be thinking about her. I sometimes forget that some people are, like Glorious Supreme Leader, are born perfect with no faults, weaknesses, or room to grow. Not going to bother explaining that any guide becomes redundant if it's not needed. Instead, I'll just thank these souls for their insight and wish them a speedy trip to  Mount Olympus.*

235,Working On The Alpha Fucks Side Of Hypergamy To Get The Best From Women,92,rt2c95,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rt2c95/working_on_the_alpha_fucks_side_of_hypergamy_to/,26,"When listening to Red Pill content, a lot of the comments are negative when it comes to women.  They talk about getting ""divorce raped"", paternity fraud, etc.  This is good for awareness sake, but it's not good to carry around as a grudge.  All of this can be avoided if you're aware AND you operate from the Alpha Fucks side of Hypergamy.

Sex:

Some men have the attitude that women don't like sex.  This is why their girlfriends monkey branch to Chads, Tyrones, Pookies, and Ray-Rays.  These men are known for pounding out pussy and women can't get enough.  Before you even think about dating a woman seriously, focus on increasing the amount of orgasms you can give a woman.  If you build up a rep with women that you're a ""Mr. Goodbar"", as Rom Wills calls it, you will notice a lot of good cooperation from women.

Emotional Strength:

Women are very emotional.  So emotional that they try to transfer their emotions over to the guy.  If the guy doesn't seem sympathetic enough to her feelings, she'll try to guilt trip him.  This guilt trip can turn into an argument with some men or it can make some men walk on eggshells and try to appease her.  The man with emotional strength will is not be phased by her emotional episodes.  His demeanor towards her emotions can set her at ease or it can piss her off.  He doesn't care.  He knows that women are gonna be emotional at times and, as long as nobody died or got hurt, her emotions are not his problem.

Physique:

Rom Wills has something he calls ""body game"".  This is when you use your physique to attract women.  You might wear wife beaters or tight tees, showing off your physique.  You might wear sweats showing off your bulge.  Women get horny off of the male body just like men get horny off of the female body.  You can use that to your advantage.  If you're overweight, lose the fat and put on muscle.  If you're bony, pack on some muscle.  You don't have to kill yourself at the gym.

When man has a good physique and he carries himself with confidence, women get extremely turned on.

Cold Approach And Taking Rejection:

I think one of the best things a man can do is go out and cold approach to build up his mental and emotional toughness with women.  Too many men rely on online dating, where a lot of men are getting crappy results.  If you went out and approached  about 5-10 women a day as you go about your day (in some cases,  you may have to shop or run errands outside of your usual spots), you could get a few numbers over a few days or weeks.  When a man has the power to get dates within a few days to a few weeks due to having the confidence to approach the women he's sexually attracted to, he starts to gain an abundance mindset.  If he has a rotation of 3-5 women, he's not crying over a woman who flaked on him.  If one of the women in his rotation happens to leave, he will simply replace her within a week or two.  Then it's business as usual.  Men operating on this level have supreme confidence.  His confidence allows him to be more ballsy when he goes out to bars and clubs and talk to women.  If he doesn't get laid after going out, he can simply call one of the women in his rotation.  Hell, before he goes out, he might have sex and just enjoy the night with his friends and not even think about pussy.  However, his cool, care-free demeanor may attract women.  He might get laid (again) without even trying.

You Will Have A New Found Love For Women Because You Are Getting Better Results With Women:

When you deal with women on your terms, the both of you are happy.  The problem most men have is they're dealing with women on their terms.  These women lose respect for men who deal with her on her terms.  Being that you're able to replace the women you lose, women will be on their toes if they want to be with you.  They're competing for your validation and affection.  You may notice women being highly cooperative because they value and respect you.  If they don't, they know you're quick to check them, unlike other men who always wanted to be on her good side.

This good behavior women will display towards you, will make you enjoy a woman's company.  I'm talking about after sex, too.  You will have women serving you (food, drinks, massages,etc), making sure you're comfortable and happy.

Residual Pussy:

Women talk.  If you're fucking the holy hell out of the women in your rotation, some of them will tell their friends.  You may be out and about and one of her friends might approach you, telling you she wants to know why her friend is always getting giddy like a school girl every time she's about to go see you and she wants to know what the fuss is about.

Leaning On The Alpha Fucks Side Of The Game Can Help You Overcome Red Pill Rage:

When a man is considered a Chad or Tyrone, he tends to stop complaining about women.  No more talk about divorce rape because he's smarter about the women he marries.  He's dating women who have a genuine desire for him.  He's not quick to marry her, but quick to charge her to the game.

It was inherently political (because how could you not make societal predictions without at least some politics?). 

While this is not strictly sexual strategy, I think it's largely related. Sexual strategy follows culture which is becoming increasingly political and polarized.

What scares me is that some of my own predictions from last year were not extreme enough. (more in comments).

From a red pill perspective- something that I believe separates an average chump from a red pill awakened chump, is the ability to analyze trends around you and both synthesize theories about what and why it is happening, as well as draw conclusions and predictions from the data points you have.

For instance, in the early 2010's we easily saw the undercurrent of Marxism pushing against masculinity and made predictions that only in recent years have come to fruition- transitioning children, hate speech rules and laws protecting anti-scientific consensus about genders, and increased legal liabilities for men in general.

So let's get to it- what are your predictions for 2022?

238,Boundaries,187,rpsj5b,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rpsj5b/boundaries/,40,"Humans evolved to feel like the most important thing to an alpha male are his purposes, and he absolutely cannot let anybody distract or deter him from those purposes. Imagine the alpha leading the tribe on a hunting expedition, and right as the alpha is about to plunge a spear into the heart of a buffalo that will feed the tribe for weeks, a woman who does nothing but post selfies on Instagram all day texts the alpha looking for attention. If the alpha ignores the hunt to text the Instagram model back, the tribe starves. Now imagine Mike Tyson is walking to the ring for a World Championship fight and right as he is about to enter the ring the same worthless Instagram model texts him. Again, if he stops and texts her back, he loses the World Championship and destroys the very thing that made him attractive. In the same way, if a woman senses that she is distracting you from your mission, whatever your mission happens to be at the time, she loses respect for you, even if your mission is just enjoying a music festival or a night out at the bar. 

In the modern world, peoples’ basic needs are easily met and even busy guys with awesome lives have lots of free time to text girls and like booty pics on Instagram. The tribe will not starve, nor will it really affect your time or schedule to spend 2 minutes and $15 buying a woman a drink at the bar, but womens’ subconscious minds are still wired to feel like a man who is even a little distracted from his mission is compromising the safety and success of the tribe and cannot be the alpha male. To her subconscious mind you are letting thieves and leeches rob the tribe and you might as well be giving your wallet to a homeless guy. 

Once you realize how important it is for the alpha male to remain focused on his mission and how deeply women care about where the man’s focus is, you realize why women are sometimes attracted to men who act aloof and ignore them. When a woman emotionally invests in a man, she subconsciously assumes he is ignoring her to pursue some awesome adventure, which makes him even more attractive. Meanwhile, the guy might not actually be pursuing a cool adventure at all; he might just be watching TV and scratching his balls. It does not matter – her subconscious mind fills in the details of the frame with wild fantasies of the cool stuff he might be doing.  

At the same time, however, men and women evolved to emotionally connect when they both appropriately contribute to a common purpose, so you can and should reward women when they contribute to your emotional experience. If a woman from the tribe texts the tribal chief the location of buffalo to help the hunt, he should thank her and probably give her some of the meat from the hunt. Similarly, if a woman cooks and cleans for Mike Tyson as he trains for the title fight, Mike should do something for her after he wins. And so forth. And on a smaller scale, if a woman is contributing to you having a fun night at the bar or a nightclub, you can pay her attention. But please note that you can only reward a woman AFTER she contributes. Humans evolved to feel like there is one alpha and many betas, and the alpha does not have time to do a bunch of stuff for each beta in hopes they might contribute later. 

To establish boundaries, you must create a set of rules for yourself that will not violate under any circumstances, no matter how emotional you get about the woman. Your particular rules will depend on your purposes, your values, and your temperament, so I cannot tell you exactly what they should be. I am not even sure what the “correct” rules even are - I can just give you a few examples of rules I maintain for myself: 

1) I never wait for a woman for more than 20 minutes unless she has a very good excuse. 

2) I do not buy anything for a woman unless she has done something significant for me first (for example, coming to meet me on a date). 

3) I do not stay up past a certain time unless certain things are happening. 

And so forth. 

Although I cannot tell what specific boundaries to construct, I can give you two primary principals that should guide the construction of your boundaries: 1) You must follow the alpha male quid pro quo and 2) you absolutely cannot let a woman distract you from your purposes. If a woman wants your time and attention, it must generally fit the framework of your purposes, and she must give more than she takes. If you can stick to these two principles, you will generally construct good boundaries.

239,Surfing the Whorely Yuga,259,rod83s,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rod83s/surfing_the_whorely_yuga/,36,"

#Introduction: What is the Whorely Yuga?

*The Whorely Yuga: The last cycle of femininity in the last cycle of civilization (Kali Yuga.) The Whorely Yuga is characterized by an extreme decadence in traditionally feminine values (Chastity, submissiveness, beauty, loyalty) and societal pride in their opposites (promiscuity, boisterousness/aggressiveness, ugliness, treachery.)*

Whether you like it or not women have decayed. You can either bitch about it or become a man who knows how to surf the Whorely Yuga. This is a long post, so break it up if you need to. It took me almost a month to write.

This post is broken into parts. 


**1. Masculinity in the Whorely Yuga.**

**2. How women cuck men in the Whorely Yuga.**

**3. How to avoid being a cuck.**

**4. Surfing the Whorely Yuga.**


Each part builds on the previous one so don’t skip around. 

Grab your surfboards. This is my Christmas gift to you all.

-----

###1. Masculinity in the Whorely Yuga.

Masculinity doesn’t change. What was useful to men in the past will be useful for eternity. Jack Donovan is spot on with what Masculinity is. 

Jack Donovan believes masculinity is tribal, and it is. We evolved in packs and we associate in packs. Find a tribe that believes in what you believe in and stick with them.

**Strength:** *The ability to exert one’s will over oneself, over nature, and over other people.*

**Courage:** *Courage is the will to risk harm in order to benefit oneself or others. In its most basic amoral form, courage is a willingness or passionate desire to fight or hold ground at any cost (gameness, heart, spirit, thumos). In its most developed, civilized and moral form courage is the considered and decisive willingness to risk harm to ensure the success or survival of a group or another person (courage, virtus, andreia).*

**Mastery:** *Mastery is a man’s desire and ability to cultivate and demonstrate proficiency and expertise in techniques that aid in the exertion of will over himself, over nature, over women, and over other men.*
 
**Honor:** *Honor is a concern for one’s reputation for strength, courage and mastery within the context of an honor group composed primarily of other men.*

A man is a biological male possessing these virtues. Being a man is an ongoing pursuit. You don’t hit certain thresholds of a trait and say you’re done. You can always be stronger, more courageous, more skillful, and definitely have more honor. Keep this in mind for the conclusion.


Let's learn about some tactics women use to take advantage of men lacking in these virtues.

-------

###2. How Women Cuck Men in the Whorely Yuga. 

**Taking advantage of a man’s weakness.** 

If you can’t exert your will over yourself, others, or nature, women will sense this and take advantage of it primarily through insults. 

Look at how women treat men that look weaker than them. If you’re a skinny fuck she’s going to insult you, mock you, and look repulsed by you. This is all to lower your self-esteem and for her to remind you that she doesn’t see you as worthy enough to clap her cheeks. All of this makes a man easier to control whenever she may need you for some bullshit task in the future.

If you’re mentally weak, i.e. unable to control yourself, she’ll take advantage of you primarily through your impulses. She will use her sex appeal to get what she wants out of you without actually fucking you. I fell prey to this even after I got a little more mass on me. Beware. 

**Taking advantage of a man’s cowardice.** 

If you’re a coward she’s going to absolutely shit on you. Notice the difference in tone a woman takes when she’s talking to a man she sees as courageous versus man she can walk over. If she sees you as courageous and willing to call her out on her bullshit, she’ll walk on eggshells. If not, she’ll scream at you, talk down to you, snap at you, and maybe even hit you because she knows you won’t do shit back. 


**Taking advantage of a man’s lack of skill.** 

To women, not having a trade is akin to being mentally challenged and useless. I don’t care how many feminists scream in my inbox or out in the streets: Women will always expect men to be able to provide. Her words may be feminist but her actions rarely are. 

Yes, women can find ways to take advantage of men who can’t provide. They’re usually used as ornaments and orbiters. Most of the men orbiting a woman are lacking in status (which usually stems from a combination of mastery and honor). If they weren’t, the woman would be orbiting him.  

**Taking advantage of dishonorable men.** 

This is by far the most common. Women take advantage of dishonorable men by turning them into allies for the feminine imperative. Male feminists are usually males who were disgraced by actual men and now crave yeast-infected equality pussy to make themselves *feel* like they’re a high-value man. Sex is a good indicator of status, especially nowadays. Trash men will do **anything** it takes to get it even if it comes from beached whales and at the cost of their honor. These are the men you see at feminist rallies, voting for abortion, buying nudes, and buying sluts copious amounts of drinks.

Males without honor aren’t men. They end up being the biggest pawns for the Whorely Yuga.  

---------

###3. How to avoid being a cuck 

The only way to avoid being a cuck is to keep accumulating masculine virtues. You have to have **all** of them. If you don’t, the virtue you’re lacking can and will be exploited in the Whorely Yuga. 

Building up each virtue is simple in execution but challenging in application. 

**Building Strength:** Lift. Eat. Sleep. Repeat. We’re apes. Get big. Go watch some videos about gorillas, notice how the biggest and strongest one moves. The biggest gorilla moves with confidence and grace: He knows he can afford it and nobody will fuck with him because he’s massive. Imagine how strong that ape is mentally, too. 

Your mentality is a response to your physical reality. How you literally see yourself in the mirror will determine your mentality. Get strong, your mind will be strong. Get big, your mind will be big. 

**Becoming courageous:** I know you have moments where you want to say something but don’t. Moments where you see somebody and imagine yourself saying something to them. All of these are impulses that need to be followed: They’re appearing in your head for a reason. Obviously use common sense. If you get pissed off and see yourself beating the shit out of somebody you should **really** think before you act. 

**Accumulating mastery:** Don’t waste your time learning stupid shit. If you’re young, get a trade. If you’re old, you should already have one. On top of learning a trade, you need to learn how to **survive.** I need to work on this. I can’t hunt for shit and would die in a day in a survival situation, most of you would too. Being a man is more than just being able to live in a society, it’s being able to live **period.**  

**Being a man with honor:** I don't care what anybody says: Men are always sizing other men up. We want to know where we stand in any room we go to. You instinctively know where you stand. If you're the only dude who is jacked and with a lambo, you're at the top. Your reputation and honor extends past your tribe once you're objectively successful. Once you're a man with honor, you are the top dog. You're the man everyone wants to be. You're big, you're strong, you have money, and you fuck bitches. The only way to have honor is to be **successful.** 


---------


###Conclusion: Surfing the Whorely Yuga 

You have three options.

1. Drown in the waves of the Whorely Yuga and give up the game completely. 
2. Swim with the waves and be a blue-pilled/purple-pilled bitch. 
3. Learn how to surf the waves and most importantly **have fun.**  

Surfing the Whorely Yuga is easy if you focus on two things. 

1. Being better at being a man.

2. Remember that women shouldn’t be taken seriously. 

I try my best to make sure everything I do is either making me stronger, skillful, honorable, or more courageous. I have a tribe of men I trust and they trust me. We shoot, lift, and womanize. I keep my mind on my progress and keep an eye out for ways I can be exploited. I refuse to be used by women, or anybody for that matter, and you should too.

**As for women I don't expect them to do anything but what they FEEL is in their best interest.**  This may seem like common sense, but dudes fuck themselves up expecting women to be anything more than what they are. This is the secret to keeping your head cool in today’s Whorely Yuga dating market. I don't expect her actions to make sense to me and I definitely don't expect a woman today to be anything more than a pleasure seeker. Why the fuck would they be anything more? Feminism has told them to do whatever they want and they're doing it. 

I don’t expect women to be chaste, submissive, loyal, or even beautiful in the traditional sense. If I need to bust a nut I'll install some dating apps, smash, and go home.  If I like her, she'll be a booty-call. Hell, I don’t care if after I fuck them they immediately text another guy. This is the Whorely Yuga, not the golden age of chastity. Not to say there aren't good women out there, but unless you want to go unicorn hunting/molding you should heed my advice.

The Red Pill is realism. It's time to be real with the dating market and how women are without getting pissy and acknowledge that the feminine ideal most of you are secretly yearning for probably doesn't exist unless you're willing to screen, train, and maintain to absurd degrees. This is only a problem if you're taking this decaying world seriously. For those of us who see the end, we enjoy knowing we're the last men left and find a balance between our golden virtues and a good fucking time.

For those of you who want a succinct parting message, I’ll leave you with this: 

***Be a man amidst ruins. Mind on his virtues. Dick in whores.***

Welcome to the Whorely Yuga.

241,I felt confident for the first time last night.,162,rkb4su,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rkb4su/i_felt_confident_for_the_first_time_last_night/,27,"I've always struggled with girls, and looking back it's not hard to see why. I have terrible teeth and had the physique of a potato growing up. I had a single, working mother so my role models were all television and video game characters. I ended up getting very bad grades in school and getting stuck in minimum wage jobs after graduating HS.

I ended up in a comfortable long term relationship in my early 20's, until we hit a rough patch and wanted to try seeing other people. I was almost 25 y/o at this time. I realized how easily she - or any girl could get attention and hookups from guys on Tinder. I quickly found that I was hopeless in comparison. I kept lowering and lowering my standards until I finally realized that not even the least attractive women saw me as a good option.

Needless to say, it was devastating. I didn't want to live any more. I took a long, hard look in the mirror and decided it was time to change. I'd rather die than stay the same.

So I started lifting weights, and cut bullshit out of my diet entirely. I've seen a lot of FR's on here where guys claim to have had their lives transformed in 2 months. Maybe it's bullshit or maybe it had more to do with the confidence than the gains. Or maybe there is some survivorship bias, as people that didn't see great results generally don't post a field report.

Despite lifting and dieting religiously, I had a very mediocre physique. I tried to go out to clubs etc alone many times. Every time, it only made me depressed. I felt like I was invisible to women, didn't have the confidence to approach, and when I did approach I never got anywhere. But I just kept lifting to take the pain away.

For me, it took nearly four years to start to really see muscle definition. Over the years, I've learned to keep the lifting/nutrition tactics that work, and ditch the ones that don't. I honestly think I'm making gains faster right now than I was when I first started lifting weights. There are some muscles that I only recently learned to truly activate for hypertrophy. For example, I recently discovered how to get an amazing chest pump on the pec deck, my chest is definitely growing faster than it ever did from just benching and doing incline dumbbells.

Recently, my confidence has gone through the roof. Whatever I'm doing now, IS working. I've started getting so many comments from people I know about how muscular I've gotten. And when I look in the mirror, I can definitely see it.

I went out alone last night. A lot of girls were dressed skimpy, but all of the guys were dressed up in long sleeves. I had made the right choice, because I was the ONLY guy in the club wearing short sleeves. With a slim fit shirt on, I actually looked super muscular and I was the only guy showing any skin.

I had a long night of flirting and dancing with women. At the end of the night I danced with a cute girl, we made out, she let me touch every part of her body. It was clear that she wanted me to actually fuck her. Then she let me dance with her cute friend and I got to touch every part of her, too. Some other guy was trying to dance with her friend, but I was grabbing them both. I felt the other dude's hand try to pull my hand off the second girl, but I didn't feel intimidated by him at all so I just held it firm. A minute later my hat disappeared and I'm pretty sure that guy stole it LOL.

I started making the second girl really horny when I started rubbing her neck and ears. I turned her to face towards me and started kissing on her neck. That's when the first girl gave me a dirty look and pulled her away from me and they both left to a different area of the club. I just found this hilarious and couldn't stop laughing.

Going forward, I'm going to keep improving both my physique and other aspects of my life. I'm more motivated than ever. I will probably go out more since my confidence is skyrocketing, and push the limits of how far I can go with women. I WILL attain abundance, and right now I'm so close I can almost taste it.

TL;DR I've been invisible to women my entire life. Even years after I started lifting, I wondered if I would ever be attractive. I thought about quitting many times. However, after about 4 years it started to change. I went out last night dressed like a slut and, for the first time in my life, made out with a random girl. I also made people jealous and it felt great.

EDIT: A user PM'ed me asking if I had before/after pics, so I'll share them here.

242,My 1 year Monk Mode progress.,320,rk6dgf,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rk6dgf/my_1_year_monk_mode_progress/,70,"Hey everyone I wanted to post my monk mode progress in hopes that I can help other men become more motivated. As of today I have completed 1 year doing monk mode and it is the best decision I have ever made. 

About me 

I found the red pill thanks to my grandfather. For reference I was born in 89. When my parents broke up my dad went through the grinder that we are all familiar with the divorce court. During this time my grandfather who is still married and never divorce came across tom leykis as he is on the road often. When I entered high school my grandfather would always tell me to listen tom leykis and of course I never did. He would always tell me to listen to him but, unfortunately it wasn't until 26 when I finally listened to tom on youtube. After, I went through the rage and came out of that around 28. During this time I was in a relationship which recently broke down december 2020. At that time I decided to do monk mode for 12 months. Now the results. 

The first 3 months. 

The first 3 months of monk mode was really easy. Before the break up both me and my ex were over weight. Thanks to my now best friend, he told me about the keto diet. In 90 days I went from 277 to 230. After losing the weight I experienced more attention from women which really helped my confidence. During that time I was also promoted going from 16 to 22 an hour. Not much really happened in the first 3 months other than focusing on my diet and saving to pay off debt. 

Month 3 to 6

During this time I began to experience hardship in regards to wanting women. One thing no one talks about is when you lose weight, a man's lobido begins to rise. I felt like I was 18 again having boners almost every morning. This is when I started using escorts again which I am ashamed to admit. During this time I may have spent about 2k on escorts, It felt as if I had a void that escorts were not filling. I also made some bad choices and left my good paying job to go back to retail.(I hate myself for that.)  

Month 6 to 9.

Now this is where the magic really started to happen. Back in march I purchased donovan sharpes course. In my opinion it is a  great course but not for someone who is truly not ready to date again. In his course he talks about books to read and in July I read No More Mr. Nice Guy and the Book of Pook. I highly recommend both books. No More Mr. Nice Guy really helped me understand why I was so nice. It also helped me understand the relationship with my mother and why I need to fly away from home. (I currently live with my mom, sister, and auntie.) In my past 2 relationships both exes complained about my mom and sons relationship. I now understand what they meant and why I need to leave and fly on my own. The book also helped me not be ashamed of my masculine energy and it is ok to want women. This is were i truly learned why I was using escorts. I wanted a women to want me and to have a real sexual connection which I felt was needed. This is when I started to really slow down on escorts. The benefit I noticed was my social skills greatly improved and talking to women was easy. I became more relaxed, attentive and non creepy. In return I notice more women giving me a positive vibe and more eye to eye contact with a smile I never really noticed before but it felt good. The Book of Pook is great because in a way it teaches how to become alpha naturally. I won’t go too much into detail but one thing I can confirm is the book talks about what happens when you gain weight from weight lifting and getting more attention.  When I lost the weight I immediately got more attention from females. As I started to weight lift and gain weight I noticed females who I always thought were out of my league gave me attention. Ladies that were lower in the looks in a way felt as if they could not match with me as if I am higher in the market value. I know it may not make sense to some, but when you see it for yourself you fully understand. 

Month 9 to today

As i said before, after leaving my great job I went back to retail like a dumbass. As I work on my mental issues after reading No More Mr. Nice Guy. I had a light bulb moment in october. I realized I was acting like my mom. She would have a great job and then leave it to work a harder job. When it finally hit me I swallowed my pride and called my old job back. I am now back at my old job making 2 dollars more than before. I am now making 24 bucks an hour which is the most I have ever made with weekends off. Today, I am so happy I did the full year. All my mental issues are gone. I am still working on no longer seeing escorts but, I have got down to 1 to 2 times a month. My social skills are much better and I am now being invited to hangouts  or people are asking me to hang out with them. Me and my sisters are hanging out every month and I now have a best friend. I will be returning back to school in January and I am currently working on starting a side hustle. 

My results 

Health 

Before. 

Weight 277

Shirt size 2xl

Pants 44 relaxed fit

Now 

Weight 225

Shirt size large 

Pants 36 slim fit

Money 

Was making 16 an hour 

Now making 24 an hour

Have a saving now

Spending 100 bucks each paycheck to buy clothes. I feel much better about myself buying new clothes. 

Social skills 

Had weak social skills, did not have social media

Now I have a best friend.

I now hang out with my sisters every 2 to 3 weeks. Before we hardly talked

Active on instagram and snapchat. When I post, my friends like and respond. I do the same back. 

It is much easier to talk to women. I noticed more positive women attraction than before and eye to eye contact.  

What is next? 

At this moment I have decided not to do the full 18 month monk mode. I have decided I will reenter the dating market on March 1 or june 1. For now I just wanted to show what 1 year of monk mode can do. With so much negative light on females today I have decided to go against the grain and find out for myself. I know I have low experience with women and I am looking to change that. One day I want to get married and I want 5 kids. With that said, I want to find out on my own if the dating market and women are really that bad. On the next post not sure when, I will post what I am doing to get ready for dating. 

Something I noticed happening after reading No More Mr. Nice Guy and working on myself.

After reading the book, I notice I no longer have any negative light against women. Today, I am very optimistic about dating and women. If anything I am excited to get back in the market and learn game. To a point I find myself not trusting the red pill as I once used to. It would be interesting to see if other men found the same thing happened to them.

243,Full Body Erection (tips & tricks to maximise vascularity and muscular fullness),62,rkeif4,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rkeif4/full_body_erection_tips_tricks_to_maximise/,25,"What is a full body erection? A full body erection is when all your muscles are looking full, and not flat, giving you the appearance of looking more shapely, larger and more aesthetically pleasing. The state of post workout pump.

**Basic understanding**

Your muscle cells are a series of thread like cells that can have contractile force, inside the cell is a fluid called the sarcoplasm (in every other cell it's called the cytoplasm.) The amount of sarcoplasm stored is able to give it a 'fuller' more dense type of look. Sarcoplasm is able to retain unusually large amounts of glycogen (polymer of glucose), water and salts.

**Nutrition:**

Get enough carbs, seriously - I know you're scared of being fat but if you want to maintain an FBE, your muscles need to be saturated with glycogen.

Eat complex carbs; oats, pasta, breads, potatoes. Starch it UP.

If you are trying to lose weight, then time your carbs in a way that it is mostly within 12-18 hours before your most intense workouts.

This gives your digestive system enough time to load up your muscles with glycogen that would be mostly spent during said 'intense workout.'

Drink water. I mean, lots of water.

Consume salt, yeah I know it's bad to overdo the sodium. I don't recommend just wildin out on potato chips and consuming the good old classic table SALT. I really recommend Oral Rehydration Salts, or a mix of salts/electrolytes. Fortunately there are lots of products that do just this, mostly marketed for runners - nuun hydration, gu, any electrolyte mix works, just make sure it isn't loaded with sugar (no gatorade), just good old salt does wonders too.

If you are on a cut, I will also suggest taking BCAAs, cause you don't wanna risk having an incomplete amino acid profile (more on this later)

On protein, make sure you get enough and from a variety of sources.  
Supplement with Creatine. It makes your muscles draw in more water, making you look dense and fuller. 

&#x200B;

**Stimulants:**

Generally I can say that most commercially available preworkout powders (Cellucor C4, Optimum Pre, Dymatize Pre, etc.) are okay to use and will give favorable results for a pump. This may be somewhat acute as the research suggests. The active ingredients are mostly Agmatine Sulfate and L-Citrulline Malate. They help you look fuller by increasing the nitric oxide content in your body.

Nitric Oxide is a vasodilator that helps relax the blood vessels, allowing them to deliver more blood to your muscles, which results in more oxygen, glycogen and salt for your muscles to replenish with.   The individual mechanisms of each compound differs; generally speaking Nitric Oxide is synthesised in the body by the enzyme Nitric Oxide synthase mostly at the endothelium (inner layer of blood vessels) where it then diffuses into your muscles.

Nitric Oxide is synthesised using the amino acid L-Arginine. I'm of the opinion that if you are able to eat a balanced diet with sufficient protein with a full amino acid profile, you should not be seeing much of a difference.

Another very **controversial** suggestion is to supplement with Sildenafil Citrate (Viagra) or Taladafil (Cialis), as they increase blood flow. However the clinical dosages recommended for patients with erectile dysfunction range from 25mg to 100mg of Sildenafil Citrate. I think this is far too high and has way too many side effects for young healthy male adults, I would only recommend 5 - 10mg, for a maximum of 2x a week before a workout to achieve a pump. However the effects would only last 2-4hrs. Perfect for a night out.

**Training:**

I will not go indepth to the training aspect, as if you're reading this I will assume you already have a workout routine, or a way you like to train. But I want to touch on some science behind the 'pump' or sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.

Your muscles can function in two states, anaerobic and aerobic. The best way to differentiate is the build up of lactic acid in your muscles, the burning sensation as you exercise - being mostly anaerobic. It's not a switch between the two, it's a dial.

**Do not neglect** the anaerobic part of your workouts as the lactic acid build up has been proven to increase the sarcoplasm in your muscle cells - known as sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.   Until it is limited by the number of myofibril (the amount of cells). Maximal effort generally stimulates more myofibrillar hypertrophy (the creation of new muscle cells) but is more neurologically taxing.

Stay hard, boys. ;)

244,How to Bench 315 Easy,59,rk69c7,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rk69c7/how_to_bench_315_easy/,50,"OK, I should clarify the title. Understanding the process of how to bench 315 is easy. Successfully implementing it is another matter. Too many people are content to make excuses rather than improve. This post is for those who want to get bigger and stronger and ultimately bench 315. If you are lifting as a supplement to MMA or boxing or some other sport, or trying to attain a certain very lean look, i.e., deliberately using light weights for a particular purpose, this post isn’t intended for you, though some of the technique tips may be useful. 

When I first stumbled upon this sub, one of the things I liked most was the advice to lift. I started lifting in the late 70s. At that time, it was common for football players to lift, and lifting was making its way into the conditioning programs of athletes in other sports. I wanted to get stronger and faster for sports, so I started lifting. I have fairly good genetics and made fast progress. I did my first powerlifting meet at age 16 and continued competing until my early 40s. I still train intensely.

When I competed, I mostly went to hardcore gyms. I was fortunate. Early on, I got technique and training advice from people much older and more accomplished than me. They saw that I had potential and helped me improve. Over the years, I’ve talked training with many top lifters and coaches. At that level, people learn from each other. If you go into a hardcore gym and act like a know it all, you won’t last long. 

I started going to commercial gyms more as my competitive days wound down. The contrast was striking. At every one I’ve been to, I see guys with potential but whose progress is stagnant. It’s no surprise because invariably their technique and training routines suck. You know the guys I’m talking about-every Monday (bench night at commercial gyms), they’ll pyramid up to a max bench. They’ll eke it out by bouncing it off their chest and lifting their butts off the bench, and their friends will high five them for it. They'll then finish their workout by doing curls in the squat rack. A year later they’ll be handling the same weight, maybe with even worse technique. 

Far be it from me to tell others how to train (without being asked), but if the subject comes up, and I tell them what’s wrong with their technique or training routine, they get all offended. Their egos are bruised. And that’s the number one reason why progress stalls: ego. People can’t accept that someone else works harder or smarter, so they make excuses and cry “steroids.” Don’t be one of those guys. You don’t need steroids to bench 315. Put your ego aside and focus on your mindset, your training routine, and your technique. Fix those things and you’ll be on your way.  

Before you go to the gym, you need to visualize every set and every rep you plan to do that day and see yourself doing it, like you are watching yourself in a movie. When you’re at the gym, you should be thinking about nothing else other than the set you are doing at that moment. The gym isn’t for socializing or picking up girls. You are there to do work and improve. Go to a hardcore gym if one is near you. There is no motivation like seeing someone far stronger than you handling weights you can only dream of. When you see someone else doing it, in person, your mind will tell you that you could do that too, that it is indeed possible. Ideally, you’ll find a training partner or group of lifters to train with who will motivate you. If your training partner slaps you in the face and puts an ammonia cap under your nostrils prior to you attempting a max weight, chances are you’ve found a good one.

Finding the right routine can be difficult. Anything works for beginners. But you’re not a beginner anymore. You need to find a program that will help you make gains. What kind of program? That’s hard to say. It depends a lot on the individual. Many disparate routines work for different people. So educate yourself. Read about how top lifters and bodybuilders train. Ignore internet gurus or youtube coaches who have a flashy presentation but have never done anything of note themselves and have never coached anyone of note. Read up on Westside training--Louie Simmons has a wealth of useful articles on training for powerlifting and technique tips. Read about high volume Sheiko training (named after former Russian powerlifting team coach Boris Sheiko). Learn about the kind of progressive overload training that used to be standard for powerlifters. 

For most of you, some form of progressive overload routine will work best for the stage of training you’re at now. Basically, you start out with lighter weights and higher reps then, over the weeks, gradually increase the weight and lower the reps. 5-3-1 (which is a variation of Rick Gaugler’s old “mini-cycles” routine) is a good place to start. Check out some of Paul Carter’s articles. He has sound training ideas for intermediate lifters. Many of you haven’t built an adequate foundation for strength by doing enough volume and reps. Get on a routine that works, not some compromise routine designed decades ago for football players that even they don’t use now. And stick with it for the length of the program. Higher volume routines in particular can make you feel like you are going backward. You aren’t. Stick to the routine once you find a good one. If your routine allows some leeway on assistance work, I’ve found that weighted dips, barbell and dumbbell overhead presses, Paul Dicks presses (look it up), close grip inclines, close grip board presses, and barbell and dumbbell tricep extensions are worthwhile. And row, row, row. Find which ones work for you and use them.

Technique depends a lot on individual characteristics, but here are some bench press tips that will work for most people. A grip slightly wider than shoulder width is most common, but experiment. I hit my best numbers with the maximum 32 inch grip (81 cm I think), which is where your index fingers are on the rings. Most people don’t go that wide. Squeeze the bar as tightly as you can. So tight that you can feel extreme pressure in your hands and wrists. I can almost guarantee you aren’t squeezing the bar as tightly as you should. Wrap your wrists if you have to. Your palms should be near vertical throughout the lift–don’t bend your hands back like most people do. When your spotter hands the bar off to you, take a big breath and shrug your shoulders. This will activate your lats. You want to lower the bar with your lats. Tuck your elbows and lower the bar as fast as you can while keeping it under control. If you bounce it off your chest, you’re lowering it too fast. But don’t lower it in slow motion either. Fast and controlled is the key. Touch the bar around your sternum or a little lower. Then explode up. Leg drive is important. Drive your heels into the floor. Get your legs into it as much as you can. As you near the sticking point, flare your elbows out and visualize bending the bar into an upside down “U” while maintaining an extremely tight grip. This will activate your triceps. For most people, the best bar path during the ascent will be at an angle slightly back rather than straight up and down. 

Diet is beyond the scope of this post, but few if any of you should be on a cutting diet, unless you aspire to be skinny fat. When your metabolism is equivalent to that of Amy Schumer or Lena Dunham, the solution is to fire it up, not go on a cutting diet. High rep squats, sprints, and high intensity cardio will do wonders in this area. Do those and eat plenty of quality protein, good carbs, and vegetables, keep sweets and booze to a minimum, and you just may find that you don’t need to cut after all.

If your progress is stagnant, continuing what you are doing is a waste of time. Lose your ego and find an approach that works for you. Maybe you won’t bench press 315 right away or next year, but you’ll improve a lot more than you thought possible, and soon you’ll be asking me how to squat 405. Good luck.",1639949417.0
245,Women are biologically programed to orbit an alpha. Cold approach is not necessary.,373,rimapr,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rimapr/women_are_biologically_programed_to_orbit_an/,139,"This is a short post.

Background:

I studied psychology for years before discovering TRP. I read the side bar twice, watched a hundred hours of pua infield. Went out every day and observed. I also approached and got blown out more times than most men could stomach. This is what I discovered.

Cold approach is unnecessary and potentially dangerous:

Women are biologically programed to orbit alpha males. They do not want men they are not orbiting approaching them. It is their nature to chose. Don't go against nature. You will lose! Most orbits are the the form of a simple AI or IOI when they see an attractive male. If you get an AI (approach invite)/choosing signal, go for it! She's giving you an interview. 

How to attract orbiters:

Note: most orbiters are yes girls, proceed accordingly.
Try this: Go out. Look interesting. If you play the guitar, if you skate board, surf, exercise, etc. this is your peacock. Girls will notice from 100 yards away. Make sure you are alone because the IOI from a distance could be for your friend. I post up at the park or beach and do yoga, I'll notice an IOI from afar and watch as she makes her way to me. Watch her but don't stare! She does not want to get caught stalking you. It mortifies them! If she stops, looks in her bag, checks out the scenery, what ever, she's orbiting, checking you out, choosing. Approaching is not necessary. Just open. ""Hey!"" 

Conclusion:

Do this and you will never have to cold approach again. They come to you. I've observed girls in my neighborhood stalking my apartment. It's true. Women are biologically programed to orbit an alpha. The evidence is everywhere, just be observant, you'll see it. A lot of you are being orbitted right now, but are too much of a pussy to talk to that girl you keep seeing around. She's stalking you. However, if you catch a girl doing this never accuse her of it before you fuck her, even if you're just teasing. You will never see her again. I've done it and they disappeared like a whisper in a crowd of screams. It literally terrifies them to be found out. Good luck and your welcome.",1639761847.0

**Or do you have those nice child-bearing hips that should belong to one of your girls?**

If you fit in category 1, great job. You’ve been lifting and this post is not for you.

If you fit in the second category however, **you got some fucking work to do.**

# Why you should care

We all know that your value in the sexual marketplace is composed of multiple facets. Based on your own beliefs, you might think that one thing is a greater contributor to your SMV than other things.

For instance, you might be one of those oldschool PUA guys that thinks you can get away with hardcore game only and that looks aren’t that important.

On the other side of the spectrum, you have the autistic blackpill crowd that think you’re doomed if you don’t have perfect facial proportions and a height of 6’2 and up.

Believe whatever you want to believe, it’s your party in the end. 

I’m one of those guys that believes the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle, and that **the best results are achieved when you try to perpetually get better at all facets of your life.** Looks being one of them.

Have you ever noticed how in movies, the lead actor can look amazing while wearing fairly basic clothing? That has to do with him **a) being jacked**, and; **b) his clothes fitting like they should.**

And guess what. Your clothes can fit better as well, especially so if you’ve been neglecting the gym.

If you want to fill out your shirt like a man should, focus on the parts of your body that fulfill that goal. You want a muscular and *strong* posterior chain, *developed* delts, and a *massive* upper chest.

Now, this is not to say that these are the only things you should focus on. Get on a reputable program and apply all of the basic principles; progressively overloading your workouts, eating in a caloric surplus, getting in 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight, you know the drill.

What I’m suggesting is that if you care about filling out your shirt, throw in a couple extra sets per workout on the aforementioned muscle groups. Below, I’ll list some of the heavy hitters to building up these areas of the body.

**Posterior chain**

* (Romanian) deadlifts
* (Weighted) pull ups
* Inverted rows

**Shoulders**

* Overhead presses
* lateral raises

**Chest**

* (Incline) bench press

Obviously, there are more ways you can target these respective areas, but these exercises have helped me a ton in building up my physique.

IMO, romanian deadlifts are superior from a pure hypertrophic standpoint, whilst conventional or sumo deadlifts are better if you prioritize strength over size.

Now, for any of this to work your diet should be on point. But that’s a whole other post. More on that another day. Let me know your thoughts below.",1639647314.0
247,Notes From the Matrix,194,rh0awr,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rh0awr/notes_from_the_matrix/,61,"**Notes From the Matrix**

**Episode 1: Boomerang Babes**

So I was having dinner with a fellow TRPer when I got a text from a buddy:

*“I am absolutely sick of your being right about everything.”*

This was followed by a text from his recent ex, to the effect of *“I don’t want to get back to together but [I really would like to have sex with you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH12OJ0MrdQ&t=11s), tbh.”*

I had predicted this, and, as often happens, I was right about it – I told him, right after the breakup, to expect it.  She was getting a bit antsy, he’s a proven performer and, because she has already fucked him, he doesn’t raise her N-count.  She could fuck him every day for 10 years straight and she’s still N+0.

Her: *“I can come see you and I’ll leave tomorrow or even later tonight, it’s just that I’m really horny.”*

He texts us back as to whether or not he should let her stay the night.  My dinner companion: *“That depends on how he feels about morning sex.”*

Him: *“Fair point.”*  

He let her stay over, and he tapped it again in the AM.

**Takeaways:** Girls are like boomerangs – they come back to you, for what a buddy of mine refers to as “The Good Part of the Relationship”, because all you do is meet for sex, no dating, no drama.  Don’t do anything stupid, like catch feels, and expect it to last only a little while before the new rubs off and the old shines through, and whatever the problems were re-emerge.  Enjoy it while it lasts, and then move on.

**Episode 2: “Say you’ll suck my dick.”**

So lately, I have noticed an uptick in girls qualifying themselves to me.  One of my regulars was texting me and why there was an interruption in my response and I (truthfully) said, *“I was loading the dishwasher.”*  Her:  *“That will be my work in the future.”*  

Me:  *“Well, really, you will be more in charge of making sure my dick is sucked.  Loading the dishwasher I can handle.  But performing light housework after that is certainly ok.”*

Another girl I met while vacationing in Europe (she’s a Finn; we had a “meet cute” in Switzerland.)  She’s straight out of Nordic/Scandinavian Central Casting: Tall, blonde and good-looking, with a ‘make-work’ job in HR that she’s not at all excited about, but hey, I don’t give a shit about her job, and…she’s hot.  

I did a cold read on her (tall, feminine, introverted) and – *SURPRISE!* – (although not to me), she’s sexually submissive, so, after building rapport, I did my patented, *“By the way, I know you’re secret”* move.  This played out over classic lines, her saying *“What secret?”* me saying, *“You know, your secret.  The one you’ve been hiding from since your teenage years.”*  I let her run for a bit and then let her “draw it out” of me.  It’s better if they have to work a bit for it, then I fired the kill shot, and told her.

**Pro Tip No. 1:**  They often won’t bother to deny it, at first.  So I let them talk and then point out that they didn’t deny it.  Boof!  

**Pro Tip No. 2:**  They will almost universally want to know how I knew.  The response is: *“I am a hunter, I know my prey.”*  This usually gives them a shiver of fear/anticipation, so I will sometimes provide comfort by pointing out that it is her nature and there is nothing to be ashamed of.  In fact, she should be happy because now (finally!) she is in the hands of a Man Who Knows What To Do With Her.

Having gone through the above, she said, *“Wow.  That was a bold question.”*

Me: *“It wasn’t a question.  It was a statement of fact.”*

Her: [tingling!] *“I love your confidence!”*

Anyway, she is back in Finland, now, but she has family in the States and will be coming over soon, and has been texting me regularly since I got back because [reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH12OJ0MrdQ&t=11s).  If it’s convenient, I will pick up her option, but we’ll see.  At some point she asked me what time it was (near 5pm, as it turns out).  Her: *“If I was there, I would be cooking dinner for you right now.”*

Me: *“Yes, you would be.  Naked.”*  Well, with an apron and heels, but you get the point.

So why the noticeable uptick?  So the only thing I have been doing differently is hitting the gym more.  It’s noticeable (to me, anyway) in my arms – the pipes are getting bigger – and chest.  Other than that, nothing else is different, so “Calculatus Eliminatus” would dictate that’s it.

248,How to get shit done and be productive,423,rgn7mq,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rgn7mq/how_to_get_shit_done_and_be_productive/,34,"There are two kinds of people.

There are people who execute.

And there are people who don't. 

They are the equivalent of trying to power-bang a hot babe with only a semi-hard dick. They accomplish nothing and yet they still feel exhausted, even though they set their minds on the right thing. 

For most of my young life, I certainly was the latter. Today, I am an executing machine. I get shit done. Therefore I decided to write up this handy post on how to become amazing like me.

**This article will teach you how to get more shit done, how to do so more consistently, and how to achieve better results in the process.**

A little disclaimer: A lot of the solutions involve throwing money at problems to make your life go smoother. If you don't have money, fix that first. 10 years ago I was broke, lonely, burned out and depressed. Today I am rich, lonely, burned out and depressed while sitting on a beach. 

&#x200B;

*  **Picking a task is a task in itself**

Deciding what to do and how to proceed, picking from a multitude of possible options, all with innumerable possible outcomes - that in itself is already a task. And a demanding one, too.

Picking tasks, deciding what to do, making strategic decisions, blocking out noise and nay-sayers - all of this costs loads of mental energy. (Mental energy being a concept we will encounter throughout this piece of advice.)

Picking a task is already stressful. So stressful even, that some people experience what is called ""analysis paralysis"" - getting stuck in analyzing mode because there are too many unknown variables to satisfiably predict the outcome of a decision. If you are more smart than brave, you are prone to this.

Deciding what to do always incorporates a great deal of fuzziness, randomness, and heuristics. Tuning out that fuzziness is emotionally taxing and burns up mental energy a lot quicker than one might think.

This is one of the core reasons most people are content with being followers instead of leaders - operating in a smaller decision space is less stressful and less scary. 

&#x200B;

* **Establish a framework that does most ""what next?"" decisions for you.**

Good matrices for this type of decision are the Eisenhower Matrix or the Kanban Framework.

&#x200B;

* **Try Kanban: Stop starting, start finishing.** (Read: Kanban in Action)

If you work in software engineering or any kind of project that has some kind of a management approach, you may have heard about ""Kanban"", which is a framework/tool for visualizing work. It's main appeal is that it allows you to keep your to-dos from stacking up.

While originally developed by Toyota for efficiently building cars in a country where storage space is scarce, the Kanban approach is applicable to life.

&#x200B;

* **One central tenet of Kanban is to ""start finishing"".**

Example: The last step of the production is to paint the car red. Therefore, the first thing you do every day is paint the unpainted cars and ship them off, so there is no unfinished vehicles standing in your lot. You never keep more paint or cars on-site than you can process in a reasonably short amount of time.  


The lesson is this:

* **Always start your day by completing tasks that work towards completing a goal.** 

If you can pay off a small debt: pay it off. If you can finish a task: do it.

&#x200B;

* **Always pick the task for the project that is closest to completion.**

Of course, there are situations where you may have to take a different approach. But having a ready-made strategy to tackle big workloads will save you a lot of time.

&#x200B;

* **You need mental energy to start a task. Don't waste it on bullshit.**

Here is a little secret about motivation: Starting a stupid, tedious time-waster of a task costs you just as much mental energy as starting an equally tedious but productive/lucrative task. Even worse: If you are like me and have some form of ADHD, there ""energy cost"" of certain tasks might be totally out of whack. 

&#x200B;

* **Be aware of what drains you and find ways around that.**

I can spend hours upon hours dealing with difficult clients and be fine and dandy, only to be more or less spent for the day when I have to sort through a stack of papers or stand in line at the post office. 

&#x200B;

* **Your mental energy is a form of currency. Think of it like a resource, similar to money or time.**

If someone suckered you into doing a bullshit task for them - and hence made you waste time and energy in the process - they basically stole from you. Worse: You let them. If you can outsource menial, tedious, and boring tasks by throwing money at someone to do them for you: do so. 

&#x200B;

* **If you make more in an hour than it costs to have someone fix this problem for you, let someone else do it.** 

This is of course provided you make a significant amount of money. The first investment I made, once I started to have a somewhat significant cash flow, was to hire a maid and a personal assistant. Even if you are not yet in ""having an assistant"" levels of income, hiring one early gives you a chance to 

Instead of driving somewhere, I take an Uber and hammer out some emails while I drive. Or I use the time to take a nap, or listen to music and enjoy the scenery. The point is: I am not wasting mental energy that I might need elsewhere later. 

&#x200B;

* **Minimize the stuff you own - but invest where it counts.**

Tyler Durden in Fight Club was correct when he said: ""The things you own end up owning you."" However, I disagree about the part where he advocates losing all your stuff in order to truly be free. You can absolutely own some cool shit and still be reasonably free - trust me. 

If there are objects in your life that you (have to) use every day and you can afford to spend the money: Don't skimp. Get things that work well and bring you pleasure every time you use them. The things you use should work and give you energy, not be a cause for headaches, and not require emotional self-regulation or constant attention. 

If you cook every day, get some nice pans or a foreman grill, or a dishwasher. If you like to lift every day, maybe build a home gym. If you work from home on a computer, get a powerful workstation and a healthy, comfortable chair. 

&#x200B;

* **Get quality sleep.**

Of all the things I talked about so far, getting quality sleep is something you can fix quickly. Get into bed early, stay away from screens or wear blue-light-blocking glasses. Take magnesium two hours after dinner. Have a good book on the nightstand. 

&#x200B;

* **Don't let toxic people run your life.** 

So far, we have only been talking about activities and stuff. But by far one of the biggest factors blocking you from getting shit done is other people. Other people constantly demand your energy, your time, and your resources. Be it your bitchy girlfriend who nags you into watching some bullshit movie with her or that loser-friend who can not get laid and constantly whines to you without ever doing anything to solve his problems. Or your annoying roommate. Or your mom. 

Since no man is an island, I advocate against cutting toxic people out of your life entirely - but you should question how much time you spend with them. 

Also, don't forget: The most toxic person in your life is probably yourself. So before going around blaming other people's toxicity for your failures, take a good, long look into a mirror.

&#x200B;

* **Fix your emotional problems.** 

This is probably a no-brainer, but I can't help but wonder how this gets neglected so often. Don't expect yourself to go anywhere if you are carrying a huge sack of emotional baggage. All of the things I mentioned so far are infinitely harder when you have to lug around all the accumulated trauma of your past. 

Here is the problem though: Even if you can bring yourself to drop the bag for some time, unleashing great power in the process, you will find yourself picking up that sack of crap in no time - usually once your life gets a little hard and because you crave the comfort of something familiar. 

Carrying emotional baggage around is a habit. A habit similar to drugs. 

Therefore, pause for a moment every few days. Take some time to take the bag of your shoulders and take good long look at **one** thing in the bag. Just one. If you look at it long enough, it will start to shrink. 

The next day, the bag will feel lighter. And eventually, it will just be that: an empty bag.",1639532696.0
249,The Psychological Benefits of Approaching,298,rf81q6,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rf81q6/the_psychological_benefits_of_approaching/,50,"There's a bit of a contradiction I often see in the RP community. On one hand we're told that our value as men is inherent, innate, that it doesn't have to be earned or questioned, we simply have it by being men. 

On the other hand, so much of the advice given by the RP community is performance-based. Like if you're not hitting the gym everyday and banging three new 10s every week you're somehow not a real man.

Well, make up your mind.

My personal take is more in line with the first perspective. You as a man are valuable, you can be okay with who you are and there's nothing you have to prove to **anybody**. 

Having said that, if you want to live a fulfilled life and experience the most amount of pleasure and euphoria possible, you need to learn to get out of your comfort zone. See, this has nothing to do with your self-worth (though you will respect yourself more if you're always testing and pushing your limits). Facing your fears and constantly overcoming them is simply the best way to live if you really want to feel *alive*.

Most human beings live in a comfortable cycle of familiar behavior patterns that are boring and predictable because it's easy and it's what they know. But again, to truly live, you have to constantly upset this tendency to fall into predictable and repeatable patterns and take the easy path in life. 

One of the best way to do this, for most men, is approaching. 

This is where most men get caught up on approaching: **They make it performance-based.**

Approaching beautiful women has nothing to do with the outcome of your performance, and if you think it does you're an idiot. The reason you should approach beautiful women is for your own benefit and well-being. In other words, it's not about her. It's not about the way she treats you, it's not about how she reacts to you, it's not about whether she accepts or rejects you, it's not about whether she gives you her number or ultimately sleeps with you.

It's about you being a fucking man, overcoming your fear, and doing something that 99% of the male population does not have the balls to do. You become a better person just by the act of doing it, the outcome is completely irrelevant.

Now don't get me wrong, if you perfect this attitude, and truly make approaching about your own self-benefit and self-gratification, totally independent of the outcome, you will get numbers and you will get laid. But it's precisely because you don't give a shit that you will succeed. Stop basing your identity and self-worth on success and simply realize that doing difficult things is a reward in and of itself. 

The psychological benefits of approaching women on a regular basis are unbelievable. You will consistently push yourself out of your comfort zone, you will improve your social skills, you will improve your game and learn how to communicate better, but lastly and more importantly, you will feel alive every day that you do it because you did not let fear control you. So get out there and take some risks.",1639372773.0

&nbsp;

Ringing any bells? Are you currently feeling lethargic, unmotivated or perhaps even depressed?

I’ve been where you are. I’ve experienced the brain fog and the feeling of utter apathy. Granted, it was a some time ago now, but I wish I discovered then what I know now. There’s a remarkably high chance that your lack of motivation is caused by fucked up dopamine.  

I’m here to tell you how to take back your motivation.

&nbsp;

#Dopamine

Dopamine. You’ve all heard about it in some way or another. The popular understanding of dopamine sounds something like this; “*Big Tech develop their apps to serve a user experience that produces a dopamine hit to get you hooked*”, “*Dopamine hits from porn makes you addicted*” or why not “*Dopamine is the pleasure hormone*”. The common popular opinion is that dopamine is responsible for the experience of pleasure and reward in our body.

&nbsp;

I’m here to tell you that’s wrong. Wrong in the sense that dopamine plays a much, much more important role than that of a pleasure dispenser.

&nbsp;


To start off, we need to understand that dopamine is a neuromodulator. This means that it’s different from the more commonly known neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters are responsible for the task of forwarding messages from one neuron to another, meaning they operate on a very local scale. Neuromodulators on the other hand influences bigger parts of your brain, so called neural circuits. When dopamine molecules are released in your brain, it activates some of these neural circuits and deactivates others. Dopamine is powerful precisely because of this substantial geographical influence.

&nbsp;

So what does dopamine influence then? **Dopamine is primarily responsible for our motivation and drive.** Our urge to pursue things in life outside of ourselves – both short term, like food and water, and long term, like our goals or women. This have been one of the biggest discoveries in neuroscience in our time, but the perception that the main function of dopamine is to make us feel good is apparently hard to kill. Dopamine is also critical for our ability to move. People with Parkinson's disease have a critical dopamine deficiency.

&nbsp;

So, dopamine is responsible for our motivation and drive, and supplemental for movement. However, the motivation part and the movement part are divided into separate neural pathways. In this article we will only discuss the motivational part.

&nbsp;

In the case of dopamine our brains have a constant release of dopamine, a baseline, going on at any point. This baseline is called the tonic release of dopamine. Your brain has another way of releasing dopamine called the phasic release which describes, in relation to the baseline, an added amount – a a peak that occurs when we achieve or acquire something we really desire. The phasic release, the peak, is what people mean when they talk about dopamine hits.

&nbsp;

I’ll now introduce you to two facts you’ve probably never heard of when it comes to dopamine.

&nbsp;

The first being that **the reward you feel from dopamine peaks depends on your previous dopamine levels.** This means that something rewarding, like a piece of chocolate, might feel incredible if you eat it while your dopamine is at baseline-levels. If you eat that piece of chocolate just after having a cigarette (cigarettes are also known to increase dopamine-levels) that piece will not feel as good as the one you had from baseline.

This means that the threshold for enjoying something you like increases all the time. This is very closely related to addiction.

&nbsp;

The second fact that is vital to understand is that;

&nbsp;

**Every time you experience a peak of dopamine, a drop down below the baseline bigger than the peak itself will occur shortly after, before the dopamine slowly works its way back to baseline.**

&nbsp;

Read that part a second time. This means that every time you experience a peak in dopamine, you will suffer a blow to your motivation and drive, shortly after. Ever wondered why you get stuck on Youtube, Netflix or fucking God forbid TikTok for hours and can’t seem to get a hold of yourself and go do something else? Well, you are actively, but not knowingly, raping your own ambition.

It’s not that the videos are so interesting you can’t leave, it’s because they (and you) consistently create a small peak in your system and then an even bigger drop. For every peak, there’s a deeper valley waiting. This realization was the foundation of my curiosity about learning to control this mechanism.

&nbsp;

**Furthermore; all of us have different dopamine baselines. Just as with testosterone, you can have a higher or lower dopamine baseline. And guess what? This actually results in you having a higher or lower drive (or: ambition) than the next person.**

&nbsp;

If this doesn’t blow your mind, as it did with mine, you should probably stop wasting your time reading this article. It blew my mind mind because it clearly tells us that if we can manipulate the baseline of dopamine, we can basically increase our ambition and drive in life.

&nbsp;

Good news is; we can.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#Increasing the baseline


So as you can guess there are a billion events that can increase your dopamine momentarily. But what about increasing the baseline? Are there things we can, realistically, do to increase it?

Turns out there are, one of which you are familiar with.

&nbsp;

Cold showers.

Coffee.

&nbsp;

Cold showers (or baths) are proven to actually increase the baseline levels of dopamine for a long time without the subsequent crash. In a study, cold water submersion proved to increase the dopamine level by an insane 250%. To offer you some jaw-dropping perspective, this increase is equal to the increase you get by taking cocaine (250%), and offers a bigger increase than having sex (200%).

&nbsp;

Chances are since you are reading this on TRP you know about cold water submersion already, and might be skeptical to these numbers. That’s fair. What we need to understand when it comes to cold showers is that to reap these benefits we actually have to endure a lower temperature for a longer period of time contrary to what we might think.

&nbsp;

The study that produced the aforementioned results had the participants submerged in water at a temperature of about 15 degrees Celsius/59 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes before they recorded these results.

With that said, you don’t have to work with these extremes, I certainly didn’t and I in no way recommend it as a starting point, but it should give you a clue as to why you might haven’t felt the boost if you tried cold showers before – your cold shower was simply too hot.

&nbsp;

Coffee might seem like a strange addition but there’s a good reason. Coffee itself doesn’t raise dopamine-levels extensively, but what it does is that it increases the amount of dopamine-receptors. This means that coffee essentially acts like a lubricant for your dopamine, and enhances the effect of the dopamine released. I should clarify that it’s the caffeine in coffee that does this, so it will work with other caffeine sources as well.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


#Field report


So, you now understand that we all have different baselines of dopamine circulating in our brain. This baseline determines how ambitious you feel, and the peaks we experience are closely followed by a drop in motivation.

&nbsp;

When presented with this information I decided to test it out for myself. I made the key assumption that any stimulant such as screen-time, exercising or listening to music will trigger a phasic release of dopamine. In fact, I assumed that any time I did anything that stimulated by brain in some way, an increase in dopamine would occur. This is probably not the case, nevertheless I used this assumption because I wanted to avoid the inevitable drop in dopamine that comes after the peaks so I could ‘get to know’ my baseline better.

&nbsp;

I started out on a Saturday morning by taking two full days off any external stimuli, except for exercise. I removed all social media from my phone and put away my laptop. I did this because I wanted to allow my dopamine to level out. This basically meant that when I wasn’t cooking dinner or working out I spent my time sitting down somewhere, thinking and reflecting.

&nbsp;

I then proceeded by adding cold showers every morning to my daily routine, except for Sundays. I wanted one day without the showers. Part because they’re painful but also to see if I experienced a drop of motivation that day. Immediately after the morning shower I had a cup of coffee, the reasoning behind this being that I would use the two tools discussed above in conjunction with one another.

&nbsp;

I also tried to schedule events that would increase my dopamine momentarily so the following drop in motivation wouldn’t affect my day. For instance; later on when I used my social media, I did so in the afternoon when I’d accomplished all I wanted to do that day, so the inevitable drop in motivation couldn’t affect the outcome of that day. This conscious mapping of peaks-and-drops throughout the day is referred to as dopamine surfing.

&nbsp;

I’ve now completed my seventh week with minimal digital stimulation and cold water submersion and I can honestly say that my feelings of motivation and drive have skyrocketed. The main difference I notice is that everything I do, I now do deliberately and with more purpose. Eating well and exercising is completely effortless. I use my laptop and social media but I use them for very specific reasons and on dedicated times during the day. Starting out the cold showers were a pain but I now do them every day because I truly feel more calm, focused and motivated. As for the temperature I’m now down to about 18-19c/64-66F for about 3-4 minutes.

&nbsp;


New guys on on this sub can easily get caught up in the notion that you have to maximize your productivity and be as efficient as you can during every waking hour of every day. I’m here to tell you that I have clearly experienced the benefits of added motivation and clarity due to turning down the constant stream of stimulation offered to us by modern society.",1639314971.0
251,Habit Formation: The most important conversation you’ll have.,254,rdzygp,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rdzygp/habit_formation_the_most_important_conversation/,21,"**INTERNAL DIALOGUE**

Recently re-read *Atomic Habits*. A key point that re-affirmed the importance of Internal Dialogue for me;

*”To change your behavior for good, you need to start believing new things about yourself. You need to build identity-based habits.”* 

~ James Clear

Habits are best formed when you *first believe in yourself.* Or as I read it; *you identify as the person you wish to become.* From there *the process* is honed. Until *the outcome* is achieved. As opposed to setting at a goal and working backwards. It’s a small but powerful distinction.

**Field Report** 

I loved drinking. Specifically binge drinking. Friday rolled around and until Sunday, the beers flowed free and clear. I destroyed my first marriage because of it. After my divorce I knew I had an issue. So I got help.

Through counselling I delved into the causes. Better understood cues, urges, responses and rewards. Not just the *processes* around my drinking; but more importantly; *my identity as* a drinker/party boy. Which was “The Lightbulb Moment”, for me quitting alcohol *cold turkey*. For almost 5 years. I changed my identity, *internal dialogue* and processes first by telling myself daily; *”I am a non-drinker.*” Then reinforcing that internal conversation, with my daily actions and habits. Eventually I simply became a habitual non-drinker.

**Conclusion**

It’s a small but *pivotal* tool to drive habits. First having that *conversation internally.* Then reinforcing that dialogue, with *daily actions that become habits.* Hopefully it can help you too.

252,How To Transform Your Dribble Dork Dick Into A Commanding Cum Cannon,364,rb7kk3,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/rb7kk3/how_to_transform_your_dribble_dork_dick_into_a/,122,"I'd like to preface this brilliant masterpiece by reminding everyone here that the Red Pill is a forum on sexual strategy. The specific sexual strategy humbly pioneered by Alpha Scientist GayLubeOil for the betterment of humanity is: consuming an assortment of herbs, extracts and supplements to unnaturally supercharge your seminal volume and viscosity before annihilating women’s unsuspecting faces with thick streams of cum. Unfortunately, this ingenious scientific breakthrough masterfully published in the fine literary community we call the Red Pill, is of no use to most of our readership.

The vast majority of the men present have no use for real sexual strategy as they are not sexually involved with women and lack the initiative to change this fact. They compensate by pursuing the asexual strategy of consuming increasingly niche pornographic videos before ejaculating up over their pizza belly between their voluptuous male breasts. If you are such a person—and let's face the facts, you probably are—this advice will only make your life worse. Which is why you should tab out of this article right now and go back to the *hub*. Betas cannot stand discipline or chores, and drenching your Costco socks and Walmart towels in more cum will only burden you with additional laundry and cleanup.

Now that the Beta males have retreated into their Coomer-Corners, we masculine Alphas are free to confront the serious ethical issue of male virility enhancement. Specifically, why should we shoulder the financial, nutritional, emotional, and metabolic burden of producing exorbitant volumes of semen only to selflessly give it all away? The short answer is because we Alphas are natural born leaders, and leaders care. Nobody said it was easy being captain of the cream team dream team. But sometimes a man has to nut up, shut up and do the right thing.

**White Christmas**

The holidays are here! Which is why it is the responsibility of every Red Pill Alpha to power up his seminal vesicles in preparation for the season of giving unnecessarily potent and voluminous cum shots. Buying a diamond ring only empowers ethically and environmentally dubious diamond mines. Instead be socially responsible and give your lucky lady an organic pearl necklace. The only thing that will surpass your frothing white waterfalls will be your virility and urgent need to bed hotties as your turbo charged prostate aches from souped up production.

Santa may only come once a year, but you’ll be coming all year round even after this *very* white and sticky Christmas with these potent supplements that were kept secret throughout the ages by the wise men of antiquity. She won't just be dreaming of a white Christmas, she'll be screaming from the hot sticky creaming. Let us not forget the symbolic nature of the visit of the three magi to baby Jesus. Three wise men from the east, bringing the newborn king gold, frankincense, and myrrh, were actually bringing him powerful supplements. If you’re not convinced, check out St Theresa of Avila’s account of the time Jesus gave her an orgasm.

**Choosing The Chosen**

Christmas can be a difficult time of year especially for God's Chosen people who for some reason or another had chosen to nail a 30 year old man to cross, crown him with thorns and stab him with a spear. It's not a big deal though because he slept it off in a cave and came back three days later, good as new. Contrary to what our critics may say   we here at the Red Pill are loving, tolerant and inclusive. Semen blasting your Ashkenazi like it’s the last night of her Birthright trip is a surefire way to make her feel included in this special time of year. There is still hope for those who believe that the messiah has not yet come. It's our job to make sure the Khazars know how much we care by inviting them to a midnight tasting of our Matzo Ball Soup.

**Reversing Racism**

Let's be honest, this has been a difficult year for race relations. It is our solemn obligation to do everything in our power to mend those very important bridges. After all, we here at the Red Pill like to pride ourselves on being bridge-builders. The most despicable, destructive racist thing anyone can imagine is undoubtedly blackface. Therefore logically speaking the most anti-racist thing is to the exact opposite: whiteface. Centuries of slavery, expropriation, colonialization all triumphantly solved with a few urethra contractions. Only a true Red Pill Alpha could have the courage to selflessly invent such an ingenious solution.

Turn your little drow girlfriend into a cute high elf with a warm, creamy Kwanza gift. This will keep you from planting your seed in her fertile black soil and instead give her a moisturizing and exfoliating lotion that will make her really stand out at her next basketball tournament.

**Immunizing Women with your Load**

While most men are receiving heart-rate boosting booster shots in [exchange for sex](https://archive.md/jkduk), we healthy alphas want to incentivize our women to remain fertile with working organs. Instead of letting your girlfriend get boosted by Bill Gates, offer her a healthy dose of your load on her face to keep her skin in good condition. Boosting your girl yourself instead of relying on Big Pharma's infinite cash-cow of booster shots, has the added benefit of stress relief when any second you can be removed from your house and quarantined for exercising [your body, your choice](https://archive.md/vnM28) by not submitting to the endless neo-liberal bureaucracy.

**The Secret Potion To Fortify Your Masculine Lotion**

Now that you understand what must be done and why it is your sincere responsibility to do it, let's discuss how to do it. Blend or consume the following with yogurt in your pre-breakfast protein shake.

L-Arginine, 900mg - 3 pills

L-Carnitine, 500mg - 3 pills

L-Lysine, 500mg - 2 pills

Zinc, 50mg - 1 pill with added selenium

Soy Lecithin - 2 Teaspoons

Maca Powder - 2 Teaspoons

The problem with l-arginine is it gives you stomach cramps. A bottle of l-arginine pills will usually say to take six of them a day to
reach the RDA but you should only take one or two pills, pull them apart so the arginine powder comes out and mix it in with yogurt. Do
that twice daily to ease digestion. Taking the zinc (don't go over the RDA or it will fuck with your copper absorption) alone will make you secrete much more prostatic fluid and make your cum thicker and again slightly more voluminous.

Lecithin alone will increase your volume A LOT, this makes your seminal vesicles feel full. Add a heaping teaspoon of lecithin granules
with the arginine into the yogurt.

Maca Powder has long been used to increase fertility.

Eating celery doesn't increase the amount but makes your cum a brighter white which as you can imagine is important for race relations.

Following this regimen for a week in combination with proper hydration will easily get you to the holy grail of 10ml. For reference the average is
between 2ml and 5ml.

You need to do kegel exercises too, not to increase your production but to have enough muscular strength to Spiderman your web in a satisfying triumphant blast. Producing a lot of semen only to have it dribble out over the course of a couple of minutes is beta, lame and disrespectful to women. 

Proper hydration and lecithin is necessary to make your ejaculate more fluid. The more watery
it is the more you'll shoot out all at once and the more it'll go everywhere. This makes your contribution look larger rather than cumming in thick viscous dehydrated globs.

While you're on your load maximizing mission, you may encounter a certain flavor of beta known as the NoFap Cultist. These shriveled husks live in a rotating state of either constant panic or smug self confidence, depending on whether or not they've touched their weener recently.

Since your goals actually involve getting laid in real life, you can simply ignore these charlatans as you blast hot sticky loads across women's faces. Why? Because a guy calling himself Red Pill Alpha Superstar GaylubeOil told you to.

You’re not supposed to give up when things aren’t going well at the gym. You’re supposed to persist so you can break through your plateaus.

You’re not supposed to give up when things aren’t going well in your career. You’re supposed to keep trying until you find something that works.

You’re not supposed to give up if you encounter a serious setback in your life like a bad breakup. You’re supposed to get back on the wagon and try again.

You’re not supposed to give up when a girl flakes on you. You’re supposed to………..

Wait….

What are you supposed to do?

And that’s where we get to conflicting sets of advice.

On one hand, some people say that you SHOULD give up if a girl flakes since anything less than a “fuck yes” is a no.

On the other hand, some people say you can keep trying in a non needy way since the girl hasn’t officially rejected you yet and a little persistence should be enough to get you over the fence.

**Million Dollar Question: Is Persistence with Girls a Good Thing or a Bad Thing?**

The answer is, it depends.

Are you persistent in the right kind of way?

In order to understand this concept better, let’s examine the wrong way first, to establish a baseline of what not to do.

# The Wrong Kind of Persistence:

The wrong kind of persistence happens when guys go into what I like to call: “Mr. Follow Up” Mode.

Mr. Follow Up Mode is when a guy gets a girl’s number, asks her out, doesn’t exactly get a firm “No”, but gets flaked on or hit with some kind of excuse.

“I’d love to grab coffee with you but I have a meet my friend today”

“I’d love to grab coffee but today’s no good. Follow up with me next week”

“I’d love to grab coffee but I’m not feeling well today and I’m really tired. Talk to you next week”

If you use the “wrong” kind of persistence, this is what happens:

You actually wait until next week to “follow up” with the girl.

She sees you doing all this work just for her and gradually loses what little attraction she had for you to begin with, completely drying up her pussy juices.

You keep following up because you were taught persistence is a good thing and hard work is rewarded.

You encounter more excuses, more flakes, more games.

In other words: IT’S FUCKING OVER BRO

She treated you the way you treated the car dealership that you rejected when you tried to buy a car. You didn’t have the balls to tell them “No, I’m not doing business with you”, you gave them a soft, “I’ll think it over, follow up with me Monday”.

Then when a sales guy from the dealership calls back, you hit them with excuse after excuse or worse yet, don’t even bother picking up the phone at all.

And that’s exactly what happens if you go into Mr. Follow Up Mode with girls or potential customers.

You are NOT in control. They are.

Occasionally, you could get lucky because the customer or the girl makes a decision to go with you after comparing you to all the other options that you’re the best fit, but more often than not, they end up going with another company/dick.

# The Right Kind of Persistence:

The right kind of persistence happens upfront at the MOMENT OF RESISTANCE when it is FIRST ENCOUNTERED.

Instead of settling for a girl’s number, you fucking ask her to hang out right then and there while you’re in complete control of the situation.

“Let’s grab a coffee after work. Come on let’s go”

“I know this awesome bar we should go to right now. Come on let’s go”

“Let’s get out of here, I have this really cool Sangria recipe you gotta try back at my place”

All goes well, that’s a close right then and there and you don’t have to worry about dealing with a flake to begin with since you locked her in for an instadate right here and now, not a potential future date that can be cancelled.

But let’s say she gives you some kind of objection as to why she can’t go on this coffee date right now.

This is where 99% of guys lose the frame battle and give in to the girl’s frame, settling for a shitty number/Instagram close that might lead to a flake later on down the line.

The 1% Game guy will instead use the right kind of persistence right then and there to overcome her objections and get her to agree to the instadate anyways.

You ever watch a skilled black dude game women?

They NEVER give up at the first no.

They’re always like, “aw come on quit playin girl, let’s do this”

Skilled sales people don’t play the Mr. Follow Up Game unless there’s literally no other choice.

And that’s because they are experienced enough to know that right then and there, at the moment of first resistance is the MOST likely time to close. If you fail to seize the moment there, the chances of closing on the follow up are dramatically reduced.

Don’t get me wrong, there are some software sales situations and other high ticket item sales scenarios where it’s virtually impossible to close the first call since there’s so many decision makers…

But closing a girl on an instadate is NOT one of those situations.

Closing a girl on an instadate is about persisting at the RIGHT MOMENT and not giving up like a little beta bitch.

**Here’s a sample of a skilled 1% Game Guy Close when resistance is encountered:**

***Closer***\*: “I know this awesome bar we should go to right now. Come on let’s go”\*

***Girl***\*: “I’d love to! But I have an early morning tomorrow…”\*

***Closer***\*: “I hear what you’re saying. But does the idea sound fun to you? Do you like the idea?\*

***Girl***\*: “Well yes… but I have to get to work early tomorrow for a Monday morning meeting…”\*

***Closer***\*: “I get where you’re coming from. So you don’t want to go to work late on Monday?”\*

***Girl***\*: “No”\*

***Closer***\*: “You don’t wanna get fired huh?”\*

***Girl***\*: “No”\*

***Closer***\*: “And what you’re saying is even if I promise we’re only gonna hang out for 20 minutes and after that I kick you out and force you to go back home, there’s absolutely no chance you’re gonna get to work on time on Monday?”\*

***Girl***\*: “Well… no”\*

***Closer***\*: “Then what are we waiting for? Come on, let’s go!”\*

***Girl***\*: “Okay! 😊”\*

When you deal with resistance the very first time it’s encountered instead of settling for the easier and safer number close or Instagram close option, you force your flake rate to go down because you don’t give an opportunity for the girl to flake in the first place.

And the true beauty of this kind of 1% Game Persistence approach is that even if you persist to the best of your ability and the girl still says no, it doesn’t leave you any worse off than if you just got the number close.

If anything, it even gives you a very tiny edge since your interaction was more memorable than the average guy who just backed off at the first sign of resistance.

# Final Thoughts:

Persistence is a virtue with women, same as every other area of life but it must be employed at the correct timing to be effective.

Persist like the average guy and you will encounter nothing but flake after flake since all the power is with the girl.

Persist like a 1%er and you dramatically up your close rate with girls since you actually convert those “on the fence” girls instead of just following up like a beta bitch.

Fight resistance the moment it is encountered. Persist right then and there.

Don’t give into her frame and settle for a “persistent” follow up game because you were too much of a bitch to fight up front with everything you got.

Happy closing!",1638737023.0
254,Defining the Red Pill,64,r8iymo,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/r8iymo/defining_the_red_pill/,22,"***Inspiration for this essay****: In my previous post there was a comment along the lines of, “TRP is only useful when it comes to dating advice for men” and unfortunately, there is a lot of truth to it. Most of the content that is from the Red Pillers revolve around the nature of women, even though there is a lot of content around becoming 1% better every day, a remarkable proportion of Red Pill content is based around female nature.*

*Due to that, I have attempted to* ***try and underline*** *the basics of the Red Pill, what it is, its utility in modern society, its mention in the traditional scriptures, so and so forth. My personal conception and understanding of the Red Pill direct the contents of this essay and any valuable comment that enriches and increases its value is welcome(as always).*

**About this essay**: This essay explains the origin of the Red Pill analogy, the difference between the Blue Pill and the Red Pill, and its purpose in society. This essay is not aimed at painting Red Pillers superior to the Blue Pillers but at understanding what the Red Pill stands for.

Hopefully, this essay will shed some light and add some value to everyone who reads it.

**Before you comment**: A lot of the readers read content in this subreddit to find faults and give their two cents which are along the lines of, “Red Pillers are stupid and believe in conspiracy theories”. Nothing can be done to stop them, so hopefully, they will be just ignored. Also, valuable examples and corrections are welcomed(because I want to learn more) but don't present counterpoints on the basis of your personal anecdotes. Finally, follow the rules of this sub.

## Origin of the analogy

The analogy of the Red Pill comes from the movie The Matrix(1999) where Morpheus offers Neo nothing but the truth([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE7PKRjrid4&ab_channel=Movieclips)). The representation of both of the pills shows the difference between actual and perceived reality. The Blue Pill represents what we are led to believe and the Red Pill represents the actual truth that exists underneath the surface. The previous statement is quite a complicated one once you see it through the lens of philosophy and psychology.

What is the difference between “your perception of the reality” and the actual reality? Aren’t they the same? If I perceive, through all of my five senses, it to be true and there is tangible evidence for it, how is it not the real truth? In that very scene, Morpheus describes this. What is real anyway? Is it the chemical signals interpreted by our brain? The skeptical and nihilistic conclusion could be, “We will never know, so, what’s the point of it all anyway? Let’s believe whatever we are told, party hard, and die when the time comes.” The counterpoint for that is the true purpose of the Red Pill and I have explained that in detail in the following paragraphs.

One strikingly similar concept(with one fundamental difference) has been represented by an allegory called “The Allegory of the Cave” by Plato. The narrative presented in that book is something like this. There is a cave where people have been imprisoned since early childhood. They have been tied in a way that they are all in a line, side-by-side, facing towards a wall, and their necks are fixed so that they can only see the wall that they are facing. Behind the prisoners, there is a fire, and between the fire and the wall, there goes a lifted pathway where people passing by are carrying things on their heads. The prisoners are only able to see the shadows cast by those objects because of the fire.

Plato continued, the perception of the real world will be based entirely on which shadows they saw while things were being carried on the heads of those people on that path. Suppose one prisoner escapes and goes onto the real world. He will see the *real* world for the first time, the true real world. He will be blinded by the sunlight as he steps outside because he was never used to the light. This is quite similar to the internal resistance human beings exhibit while being presented with absolute truth. After exploring the real world, he returns to the cave, and upon entering his eyes needs some time to get adjusted to the darkness which the other prisoners interpret as “whatever is outside causes harm”. They are so resistant to the truth that they might be ready to kill someone who attempts to drag them out of that cave, Plato concluded.

The story of Neo in the Matrix is quite similar to that. He saw the truth, believed in it, and fought for it, even though there was resistance. Cypher, who saw the truth and understood it, was so in denial of the truth, probably because it was more disappointing than the fantasy he was told to be true, he betrayed Morpheus.

The Red Pill represents the absolute truth and the Blue Pill represents what you have been led to believe. In order to explain the more granular details of the difference between the Red Pill and the Blue Pill, we need to delve into the precise explanations of the real truth and the perceived truth, which deserves an essay of its own.

## Why do people choose the Red Pill?

Individuals who publicly accept and identify themselves as “Red-Pillers” are somewhat met with hostility. They are laughed at, and often are put in a spot in a public place where they are pushed to defend their “pill-choice”. In many places, Red-Pillers are compared to “conspiracy theorists” and are disrespected because of that dogma.

So, the big question is, why do men choose the Red Pill? If you ask most of the men who do consider themselves Red-Pillers will struggle to define it articulately. Even then, despite the lack of a well-formulated definition of the Red Pill, their numbers keep on increasing. Even though those men are silenced, reported, and banned from social media, their message doesn’t die. Granted the left-leaning bias of Google doesn’t favor the nature of content that the Red Pillers put, and communities are getting banned but still, it continues to pop up in different shapes and forms.

If the Red Pill is nothing but a convoluted fictitious theory and there is no truth to it, how in the hell is it attracting so many across the board? Let’s try to find out.

## The necessity of the Red Pill

*Here is an example from my personal life. I have been told since I was a little boy, that all I need to do is work hard, follow the rules, be harmless and nice, and as a consequence of my controlled(or should I say highly predictable) behavior I will be rewarded by society. I am very sure that many men have heard the same from their parents and were told to play secondary to someone, obey the rules that have been set by someone, and work hard. I followed that, because for me that was what I was led to believe, that was the only truth that I knew.*

*I was an exemplary student until I was out of college. However, there were no rewards. I recall many moments where I said no to great “fun” plans because I believed what I was told. Even though I saw people breaking the rules, being unjust and “working smart” instead of working hard, they were more successful than me. Students who copied off of me had better grades, better jobs, and lived relatively stress-free.*

*The biggest mistake was I believed someone else’s truth. I did not have a direct relationship with the reality of the world. My interactions with the world were based on the perception of my parents.*

In his book “Thus Spoke Zarathustra”, Nietzsche explains this phenomenon. He inspires individuals to “go on their own journey” and “seek their own truth” because following a messenger of God, or a philosopher or an intellectual will limit your potential to find the truth([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-k7b8Zmh70&t=2s)).

One of the many problems with believing whatever you are told(or not seeking your own truth), is the fact that you will always be dependent on someone else who will make sense of things for you to understand. The answer to “Why didn’t I get that promotion” is  “well because you are not working hard enough” in many instances, even though we have realized it to be not true. If you cannot live a truth then it is not true. This has inspired many men to seek their own truth and has been united together on the topic of “sexual and dating strategy in the modern age”, but the Red Pill is much deeper than that. It is not just a way to educate young men to not fall into the traps of women who only look out for themselves.

Every individual has a perspective in this world and if it is articulated well and contains wisdom that can be passed upon, that perspective needs to be heard. The crucial thing is our perspective of the world continues to evolve as we learn more. Take the example of the economy. For a long time, most individuals are under the assumption that we are in control of our finances in the free market economy. As soon those individuals get a job and get a few years of experience under their belt, they start to see the reality. The same thing is applicable to medicines, food, water, and everything we use regularly. Who decides that this thing is safe? What are their motivations? Do they hold power over the common people? Will they ever misuse it, if the desirable circumstances pop up?

For a long time, it has been believed that the Red Pill is the domain of older and more mature men giving dating advice to younger men to protect themselves. In other words, “the Red Pill” discussion space has been dominated by men. This begs the question, do women not need the Red Pill? Do women not have the urge to seek their own truth?

*I cannot think of an example that is well thought out at the moment that makes a woman go, “I have been sold a lie” but I will be looking forward to examples if you care to share. I have an example, but it is not well articulated, but it goes something along the lines of, “women have been led to believe that working 60 hours a week at a job that doesn’t care about you is more meaningful than raising the future generation that you made with your body with the person you love”.* 

*Although I do believe that everyone should be financially independent, there is some truth to it where women believe the narrative that they need to max out on their career while sacrificing their own actual needs which make their lives meaningful. Also, why are most modern women dissatisfied with their lives even though they are successful in many ways including careers? More and more modern women in the age of 25-44 are reporting mental distress, these are the women who are high-performing in their fields(*[*source*](https://www.mhanational.org/depression-women)*). Have they seen it all and realized that it was not what they wanted? Did they start to realize that they have been sold a lie? Does the “epiphany phase” also apply to the general wisdom of life rather than just the dualistic sexual strategy of the modern woman?*

## The perspective of the non-Red Pillers

People who are in disbelief of the theories of the Red Pill consider themselves as “normal individuals”, as opposed to people who believe that they have been sold a lie. As it has been mentioned earlier in this essay, the non-Red Pillers(more apt) have obtained the understanding of the Red Pill from MGTOW. MGTOW came into existence, in brief, when men decided to say no to women for LTRs who “explored” their options a lot during their youth. It was also fuelled by the fact that most men have been burned by the divorce laws in multiple parts of the world, most men’s lives have been ruined by false sexual harassment allegations where men decided not to deal with women anymore.

Instead of trying to understand the cause, the non-Red Pillers believed that men possessing that understanding are impractical, insecure, and commitment-phobic. The actual message was lost in translation since most of the points of the Red Pill community were treated as anecdotal theories. Very few individuals from the other side were even willing to listen to the stories of those men, which have been highlighted extremely well in the 2016 documentary, “The Red Pill”. In the TEDx talk, Cassie Jaye, the director, accepts that she was skeptical at first, even while listening to these men who were separated from their children([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WMuzhQXJoY)).

Apart from that most non-Red Pillers do not believe any of the points put forth by the Red Pill community when it comes to dating advice. Some examples include:

* SMV is a lie and doesn’t exist
* Hypergamy isn’t real
* Men and women behave the same way
* A woman’s past doesn’t matter

The counterpoints provided by the RP community are outrightly disregarded even when presented with evidence. Most common replies include, “you are mad because you can’t get women” or “be better, stop complaining”.

## Wrapping up

The noticeable thing about the objective and absolute truth, which is represented by the Red Pill in “The Matrix” is it comes to those who seek it. An individual who is willing to be voluntarily skeptical about what they already know and challenge the intellect of the general public will only be able to find the Red Pill. So, who is motivated enough to do that? How does someone muster enough courage to go seek the truth that has the potential to turn your perception of reality upside down?

For starters, if one continues to live their life according to someone else’s truth or a lie, one will eventually see the plot holes. Men who once believed that their boss was their best friend and acted accordingly were not the recipients of the next promotion. Men who believed that their wife is with them because of their personality and not money have lost their possessions and more importantly their children.

### What should a Red-Piller do?

*Continue this exact course of action and. Engage in qualitative debates where ideas are shared and discussed with tangible evidence that supports them. But be careful because telling the truth to someone who is still “plugged and happy” will be met with ridicule. As it was explained by “Cypher” in “The Matrix”, “Ignorance is bliss”, it is only natural that the most predictable reaction to the absolute truth is denial(*[*source*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denialism#:~:text=In%20the%20psychology%20of%20human,accept%20an%20empirically%20verifiable%20reality.)*). Why not avoid pain by chasing expedient pleasure?*

*I know many individuals will attempt to shred the content of this post by sarcastically comparing me to philosophers and thinkers and that’s okay. Everyone must believe and live by the truth that they believe in. However, I still encourage the Blue Pillers of the non-Red Pillers to share their thoughts with tangible evidence from verifiable sources. The Blue Pill and the Red Pill are two versions of the truth on the same axis. The difference is the Blue Pill writes axioms based on the perception and the Red Pill focuses on the cause.*

What incident pushed you to seek the Red Pill?",1638597357.0
255,The promise of algorithmic dating,168,r7iw0t,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/r7iw0t/the_promise_of_algorithmic_dating/,138,"The most common and at the same time simplest kind of algorithmic dating comes in the form of swipe online dating (SOD), most prominently tinder, where sexual success is heavily tilted against most men.

The promise of algorithmic dating: to find your perfect match, a soul mate with the same values and goals as you, which sounds like a nice deal.

What this notion overlooks, howeber, is that the sexual marketplace is highly competitive. All individuals engaging in screening for sexual partners compete with one another for the most valuable resource - everyone wants the best mate. The market is governed by immediate satisfaction. Short-term mating strategies rule the market. Men are therefore searching for hot, young women. Women search for adventurous, high status men. Men are much more open to dating outside of their status or income class or with different social or cultural backgrounds. A man can spend decades dedicated to sexual conquest of many different partners without long-term commitment and still being fulfilled. However, short-term mating doesn’t make women as happy as it does men.

Women select sexual partners based on short-term signals, i.e. attractiveness, perceived status and emotional excitation (ALPHA traits or hypergamy strategy), but what they want in the long-term is stability and (real) status or money/access to resources (BETA traits or monogamy strategy).

On the other hand, men screen sexual partners mostly based on their short-term signals, i.e. hotness (Whore aspects), which is their primary strategy anyways (polygamy) but what they want in the long-term, supposing if they want that, is care, compatibility and mental stability (monogamy). What both want in the long-term may be similar, however, their urges tilt towards entirely different outcomes: hypergamous search for a monogamous long-term relationship in women (which is a contradiction in itself and enough material for an entirely different article) and polygamy in men.

Women, on average, are more interested in committed relationships where they live together with a high-status male and make a living by extracting his resources. This essentially leads to two entirely different markets: the long-term mating strategy for women and the short-term sexual strategy for men, which causes a clash of interests and imbalance in outcomes.

Together with the more open mindset of males to engage in sex with women irregardless of their background and the more picky nature of women to want partners socio-economically above them, a false scarcity of men is created. Herein, all the women compete for the minority of high status men only.
These several opposing markets which are summarized under the header “online dating” or “sexual market place” (SMP) form a weird equilibrium.

The results: The clash of the two opposing sexual strategies, much more freely and casual male strategy and status and stability-oriented yet fleeting emotion-based female strategy, which leads to winners and losers.
Naturally, in any creative, competition-driven or goal-oriented process, about 20% of causes account for 80% of the consequences.

This law is universal and has many names: The Pareto principle, related to Zipf’s law or Price’s law. Applied to the sexual market, it says that 20% of men have access to 80% of women. The 80/20 principle often cited here has, however, at least in the Western world, heavily shifted even more towards the highest status men, and the law can be adjusted with each passing decade: it used to be 80/20 in the 2000s, proceeded to devolve into 85/15 in the 2010s, and it's currently estimated to be 90/10 in the 2020s. (This assessment is based on one guy's personal estimation stemming from anecdotal evidence and incomplete knowledge but is also based on many findings in scientific research)

As we have seen with filter bubbles in social media and the last US elections, algorithms only showing the user’s preferences will lead to a self-reinforcing process. The supply of information is heavily skewed towards even more extreme content as the days go by, the like buttons are clicked and the feed filtered by preferences. This is especially true since the world was in lockdown for the most part of the last two years, and dating-oriented interaction has shifted almost entirely towards online dating.

The top 10% of men which successfully display their muscular body as well as their socio-economic success on dating sites have access to all the women. In principle, there is no limit for them. They have a harem of women applying for dates and wanting their attention and the men don’t mind going on dates with all of them several days of the week. There is essentially no cap for these men, they corner the market and are on top of the hierarchy because they are what all the women want.

The men themselves aren’t nearly as picky and would love to go on dates with all sorts of women, no matter their background, as long as these women are attractive enough. Since attractiveness forms a Gaussian-like curve, the average man cuts the female population in half and divides it almost equally into attractive and not attractive.

Women on the other hand rate around 80% of men as being below average in terms of attractiveness. Thus, only 20% of men are considered as attractive to women. However, being physically attractive is not enough. Men, in addition, ought to have high status to be considered dating material.

All the cards are on the table for attractive and successful men while men in the middle and bottom are not getting any opportunity. The Pareto-winning men have no incentives to settle down and all the women who they go on a date with hope for their commitment which they won’t receive.

Women cannot get the long-term relationships they want, because the high value men will not commit. Dating as a whole is pushed towards promiscuity since the men at the top who land all the dates are not incentivized to settle down and the men at the bottom don’t even get to play the game at all.

Online dating reflects the most primal urges of what men and women want. Women want someone who is a good father and provider but filter men by who is sexually attractive and induces emotional excitation. Men in constrast want to spread their seed with little consequences and maybe an emotionally stable housewife as an upgrade (a long-term relationship can also be seen as a downgrade, depending on where you are coming from).

In case I wasn't clear enough, I've got your back, [here you go, listen to a woman and a gay dude explain what I just told you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kp5L2S0LsE).

Actually what the West is currently going through, the decline in culturally/religiously enforced monogamy/matrimonium to unleashed female hypergamy, female sexual selection, catalyzed by birth control and focus on career for both sexes and at the same time the rise of the incels is not a new phenomenon. Essentially this is a digression back to the days before humans started forming larger communities and built the first civilizations. Hypergamy was the status quo in prehistoric times. The only new thing is presented by the internet and the possibilities of internet pornography as well as incels being able to form communities and rebel to some extent. In some sense, the difference between now and then comes down to women being able to screen for attractive men globally now instead of only locally and men being able to jerk off to pixeled videos of attractive women from all over the world now instead of relying on finding a real girl in the local community.

You may now wonder what there is to do to solve this societal problem and how to return to the conservative times where monogamous relationships were enforced and promiscuity was followed by social punishment. You may also wonder why I am telling you this and how I, the author, feels about the whole issue. But you won’t find any of those here. It’s neither my intention to present a twelve-step-solution to this problem nor to put blame on women. 

I can only blame the insecure and ill-informed reader who is probably still going through the anger phase and puts blame on women or society or on anyone else than himself. Yes you heard that right, don't put blame on anyone but yourself. This here right now is the situation at hand, a situation which you cannot change. It will only get worse out there. This is a gentle reminder that you should strive towards the top, to fulfill your potential, be a Pareto winner and achieve personal goals, or your mission or whatever, since this is where the fun zone starts. Utilize this situation and become the most attractive version of yourself, use this knowledge and maximize your sexual success for your own best outcomes and enjoy the decline. After all, sexual strategy is and should always be amoral. To all the other readers who want to know how to utilize this situation to the fullest all of this has been said and retold countless times before.

256,Reviving the concept of Transcendence,102,r6ypi9,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/r6ypi9/reviving_the_concept_of_transcendence/,63,"One of my favourite TRP contributors is u/Woujo, and one concept of his that captured my attention is about transcendence. It’s a unique concept in TRP that never gets talked about. In this post, I wish to further expand on this concept. I’m a STEM nerd and extended writing is not my forte, so this will be a messy set of ideas that have floated in my mind. (which is what TRP essentially is anyway).

[Link 1](https://www.woujo.com/blog/2017/5/30/more-thoughts-on-transcendence) [Link 2](https://www.woujo.com/blog/2017/1/5/how-to-be-a-transcendent-man)

I’d suggest reading his blogs first my because my aim in this post to elucidate this concept further.

So what is transcendence? Woujo’s definition:

*“Transcendence is something that is fundamentally out of our reach. Transcendence is something our mind cannot fathom or comprehend. Transcendence is something infinitely higher than us. Transcendence is something that exists beyond our reality. Transcendence is something we are drawn to and feeds all of our emotional and intellectual desires and then exceeds them. Transcendence is something that expands our mind. Transcendence is something that gives us a window into infinity.”*

And how it relates to women and hypergamy:

*“I agree that women are hypergamous. But I think that women are also attracted to transcendence. Transcendence is hypergamy on steroids: women are not just attracted to guys that are higher than them, women are attracted to men that are infinitely higher than them. A woman is not just attracted to guy who is smarter than her, but a guy who, through his frame and actions, makes it appear that he may actually be INFINITELY smarter than her. If this sounds absurd, you are correct. Often, transcendence is an optical illusion and appeals more to the primal, base areas of our brain rather than the rational part. Men have lots of theories about what women want: money, physical attractiveness, social proof, nice cars, “alpha male” behavior, etc… These explanations are not wrong, but I think they are missing something. Tangible things like money, social standing, or alpha male behavior are ancillary to a woman’s desire for transcendence OR are simply an indicator of transcendence.”*

The post goes on to reaffirm the basic tenet of TRP, which is that you must always focus on your mission and on yourself, to be growing as a person every day, and that this is how one becomes transcendent.

I want to focus on actionable things you can do to with the goal of becoming transcendent. Note that I am big on mysticism and there’s going to be an esoteric element to what I will say. I don’t expect you to believe everything, see my words as a psychological mirror whereby you take what is relevant and ignore what’s not.

**Know Thyself**

*“Know thyself and you shall know the universe and the Gods” - Socrates*

*""Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power."" - Lao Tzu*

*“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."" - Lao Tzu*

It’s even referenced in [The Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svfDdcPmELk&ab_channel=voudeaux).

Isn't it interesting that this idea was so revered by [ancient greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself), who were far wiser as a society than this degenerate postmodern world we're in?

It might seem obvious but it must be stated that you must take the journey within yourself and confront your whole self. We are not women, we don’t delude ourselves with lies to protect our sense of identity. We can’t afford to do that because it will cost us dearly. But how does one actually fully know the self? There’s many different models out there to do this sort of self-journeying. One that I recommend is Jung.  His work is incredibly profound and he was way ahead of his time. He managed to take Freud’s concept and build his own philosophy which has a distinct spiritual tone to it, incorporating the idea of the infinite. Where Freud saw sexuality, Jung saw spirituality. Freud thought men secretly wanted to fuck their mothers, Jung saw that men wanted to return to the womb and become one with the infinite/the ALL/the Buddha-mind and be reborn.

Of particular importance to men is shadow work. How it works is this; think of all the worst things humans can possibly do, and understand that within you is the ability to do it. Now close your eyes and meditate on this and see what comes up. Men’s sexuality is something that has a particularly dark undertone. In our natural state we are supposed to be dominant in a way that can be morally transgressive at times, which is an instinct borne from the collective consciousness of our species that wishes to self-preserve. This reminds me of something that Illimitable Man once said; a good man is not one that is not capable of doing evil, it is one that can do evil and knows his ability to act destructively, but reigns in that force and transmutes it for higher purpose. HVW recognise this naturally, because they saw it in their strong fathers who acted virtuously and for the good of their family. It’s only LVW with daddy issues that chase after overtly dark triad men. For every act of good you do, the “energy” of the opposite exists. When you engage in acts of charity, feelings of greed arises within you. That’s the law of polarity. One cannot exist without it’s opposite. Recognise this, and integrate it. To integrate, you transmute these emotions into something better. It’s like how you hit the gym and use your anger and rage to tear every fucking muscle fibre in your body day in day out until you are a monster. Use this negative emotions to instead be firm, hold strong boundaries. Experiment with it.

Another thing that’s of importance is trauma. Many of us here are suffering from trauma, and healing isn’t a linear thing. Sometimes when I think of my most painful childhood experiences I get a headache. This is all something I’m still working on. Inner child work helps. Again, meditate, and visualise you as a child, tell them it’s all okay and that it wasn’t their fault. Talk to yourself.

Also don’t underestimate the power of forgiveness and compassion. Understand that your parents had their own traumas and their actions towards you is a consequence of that. Generational trauma is some deep stuff. Epigeneticists figured out that the memories of your ancestors are actually encoded in your DNA. It's your goal to break these patterns of trauma so that your children end up better than you.

An exercise to here is to write down all the emotions you feel most prominently. Emotions, not thoughts. We feel an emotion first before our left brain uses rational thinking to construct a thought from it. Really hone in on these emotions. Do you feel melancholic a lot? Write it down. Anger? Write it down. Jealousy? Write it down. The key is you want to bring yourself to equanimity. To balance these such that you are calm and balanced.

Finally, astrology. If you’ve got some money lying about go and get a professional astrology reading. I know I know, you’re a capri sun and the chick who keeps crystals in her pockets you saw for a bit told you that’s a red flag. But try it out, you might be surprised.

Some books: Jung’s stuff, have a read. Also liminal thinking. Very interesting book with its own model, im not bothered to write my thoughts on it because I read it a while ago.

Now don’t get too obsessed with *tHiNkInG* and self-reflecting all day. Once you’ve dug up enough about yourself, recognised problematic patterns of behaviour and thoughts, see what the root cause of it all is etc etc, you should focus on your mission and find some meaningful purpose in life, and let that drive you.

Something I recommend to help change yourself is affirmations. Lay down on your bed and get deeper into a relaxed state, then say some ""I am"" affirmations. Here you're essentially trying to trick the subconscious into believing something. By impressing the idea that you are *already* in a state of being, the subconscious gets to work to change the conscious mind in such a way that it becomes true. Best done before bed and just as you wake up. This is when the subconscious is most malleable and open to accepting new ideas.

The benefit of Know Thyself, from an RP perspective, is that you naturally gain a strong boundary. Women’s shit tests don’t affect you because you know yourself and are assured about your own capabilities and limitations so what she says can’t affect you. You can stand your ground better. Your frame is stronger.

**Meditation**

It’s been said many many times here but of course I know there’s some of you who don’t do it. It’s a practise that calms the mind down and your mind is quite literally your reality. Everything is a projection of the mind. The same way a tree is replenished by the sunlight, meditation is you shining precious sun rays to your soul. I found it improved my game a lot. After a month of taking meditation seriously, I noticed I was more engaged in conversations. People like to feel heard, and meditation improves your conversations in ways you can’t imagine. My conversations were a lot more interesting and engaging and people were a lot more receptive as a result too. But honestly there’s so much more to it.

Another exercise to do:

*“As an extension of relaxation training, examine any action that you make, no matter how simple, and find the easiest way of doing it. Apply this method to everyday actions-dressing, undressing, picking up objects, performing routine tasks. You will find yourself expending much less energy, and being aware of what you are doing, rather than 'rushing' through a task while your thoughts are projecting into a future beyond the task. When you touch something, pay attention to the brush of your fingers upon it, feel the object through your fingers and move it with just the right amount of energy. Look at objects with a cool appraisal and visualise what you want to do with it and find the easiest way to do it.*

*Do Easy exercises demonstrate how we classify tasks as boring or routine, acts to be stumbled through as we project ourselves into a more interesting future. Direct the attention into actions that we usually think are unworthy of consideration; opening a door, picking up a glass, slicing bread. There is an Easy way to Do everything and anything. We are unusually unaware of performing simple tasks until something happens which hampers us. How would losing an arm affect your everyday life?”* \- Condensed Chaos, Phil Hine

The ultimate state of mind is this: You are thinking of nothing when you’re not doing anything, and when you are doing anything, your full focus is on said thing. Think of the energy you waste daydreaming as you walk, creating unnecessary anxiety over shit that doesnt even matter. Live simpler! Sounds obvious, but combine meditation with the Do Easy exercise and you’ll have what I like to think of as a 007 aura.

**Connect with the divine feminine**

Within the Yin is the Yang, and within the Yang is the Yan, the sense of separateness of the two is a consequence of dualistic thinking. We want to be a mix of the masculine and feminine, the masculine is what polarises the woman into being aroused however the feminine is what connects her on a deeper level. Women naturally have this inclination to spirituality because they’re very intuitive creatures. They perceive emotion in a way that we simply cannot relate too. But that doesn’t mean we can’t become more in tune with it. Seduction is not a precise science that can be rationalised completely, ultimately it’s an art, a dance between the man and the woman. You create this fantasy that she wants to revel in and submit to. The fantasy you create must be authentically you. Being able to be seen as distinctly unique is important in this, that’s what’s gonna make her dream of you at night. Connect with the Animus (Shout out to Jung) within you is important. But to really connect with the divine feminine, learn to appreciate the beauty in the world. There is beauty in everything. We even often attach ourselves to our own traumas and romanticise it in a way that’s uniquely human. Learn to appreciate art, connect with nature. Look up at the stars at night and see how fucking beautiful everything is. Even in the madness of it all. Honour it, venerate it, and be beautiful by having a beautiful mind yourself (and hit the gym).

&#x200B;

**Psychadelia**

Are you a lazy fuck who cannot be bothered for all this? Well fear not. (joking, stop being lazy and get your blood checked you clown) A shortcut to all of this is psychadelics. Do a lot of research before it. Psychadelics have been proven to help with depression and anxiety. It quite literally rewires your brain.  Psychadelics helps massively with KNOW THYSELF. It really shines all the stuff you’re ignoring about yourself. But it goes deeper. It makes you question every belief you hold, you see the intrinsic emptiness in everything, every thought, belief and construct of the mind you realise isn’t “true”. You really see what ""be formless"" is all about.

Shrooms is for healing. It’s a natural drug, and it helps with deconditioning yourself from existing beliefs that aren’t helping you. If you’re up for it, do it in total darkness. LSD is more “fun”, imo. With shrooms, you go where the mushroom takes you,

LSD you can go wherever you want. You can purposefully change your mind in certain ways. You can really experiment with it. Watch a movie of a character you really admire and see what ideas you come up with. I remember having some really profound thoughts while watching The Big Lebowski. The Dude is levels of alpha we mere mortals cannot comprehend.

Setting strong intentions is key. And don't have a particular expectation of the outcome, because that's probably not gonna happen. If you’re struggling with confidence, write some thoughts on it before about what you want to contemplate during the trip, then look at it during it. I experimented A LOT with psychadelics and it changed me in indescribable ways. I became a lot more chilled out and laidback about life for starters. I have more fun nowadays. I can return to the state of being in flow easier. But be warned of unearned wisdom. A few of you may feel that psychadelics aren’t for you. Especially younger guys here. That’s fine, don’t ever go into a trip fearing the drug.  Do your research.

**Woo-woo**

I truly believe transcendence is about embracing spirituality and doing spiritual type work. This includes meditation, energy work (chakra, Qi Gong etc), prayer and all that good stuff. A good book to read is “how to know higher worlds” by Rudolf Steiner. When you grow spiritually, the world around you changes in magical ways. But also recognise the need for catering to the mundaneness of the material (Being compassionate, empathetic, honouring nature but also realising sometimes you have to be Machiavellian). Find balance. The middle path

I stumbled across this old roosh blog post and found it quite interesting. As a guy nearing a double digit n-count, I don't feel very experienced in general. I sometimes hear about how you shouldn't care about notch count and that it shouldn't be a focus. Obviously no one should make a high notch count their life goal, but reaching a minimum might matter.

I think in this blog post he brings up a very good point. If someone has a notch count of 2, his advice will probably be less knowledgeable than someone with 40. Taking ego out of the equation, if one were to attain a notch count to be able to navigate the SMP, what would that notch count be? What kind of notches would they be? ONS or plates?

Now, if someone has plans to spin plates till the grave, this thought process might be worthless. But I think for someone who would consider LTRs in the future, this could be solid advice about their experience and would help them in their endeavors.

I bring this up because although the post itself is an interesting subject, I was wondering what others thought about his post. His post is also 8 years old, maybe minimum notch count for experience has increased, or times have changed beyond that.",1638426958.0

I always had a gripe with STFU. I never understood. In my own experience talking about things that I am passionate about always helped me with women. My game is ""talking"" game. I am still trying to build my confidence to the fullest, I am still trying to build who I should be etc, but talking was my one power that always helped out. So understanding the concept was really difficult for me.

Until I met people from USA. To clarify, I am from a small country in europe that people from USA never visit, you never meet them here. But I did meet a couple while I was on vacation in mainland Europe.   
The stereotypical american couple, two fat people, loud, obnoxious and OMG never shutting up, NEVER. Like, they could not last 15 seconds in silence. Seriously,   
I know this is a shit quality post compared to what else is here, focusing on one aspect without giving too much valuable info so here's some.

&#x200B;

Learn to enjoy the ""awkward pause"" learn to enjoy the silence at moments. Don't try to fill every single second with loud noises. This is a general rule in life, don't be an obnoxious attention seeker that cannot last a single second without talking or getting people's attention.

And to flirting. USE the damn silence. When you have an awkward pause, that's the moment when you make deep eye contact, look at her eyes, lips. During those silent moments is when your non-verbal communication should be at its peak. Have the next subject to discuss ready, but USE and ENJOY the silent pause. Then, after you made that target, she will either break the pause, or she will also enjoy it.   
Use the pause for your non-verbal ""push"" and then, break it with a verbal pull.  


Also, given how retarded some of you here are, I can predict right now that after 3 minutes of awkward pause, you break it by saying ""I gotta go take a shit""",1638346970.0
259,How to understand advice from the Manosphere... (TLDR: calibrate all the advice you receive to suit your own progress and journey..),112,r5y876,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/r5y876/how_to_understand_advice_from_the_manosphere_tldr/,13,"**I sit at my desktop computer having NOT been to the gym** since Halloween... having NOT lifted anything heavier than 20 lbs in the past month, with an aching groin, still taking fucking Advil every day. Funny story, I swear. Consider this the first, if not *only*, Manosphere related injuries...

Really, it's a funny story...

I found the Manosphere, via this very subreddit, in 2013. I had always been *on-and-off the gym*, since getting my first gym membership back when I was 21. You can spend all day kicking yourself for every missed inflection point- every single fuck up- but don't. 

You know how it went without me having to tell you... you know the story of the blue pill man: he gets a girlfriend and the gym becomes less of a priority; then he missed so many consecutive days that, he thinks, ""it's *just a break* but why keep the membership since *I'm not going right now*... Better for when I'm ready to *refocus* and *restart*..."" 

And then three years pass...

By the time I had found the Manosphere, I already had my prison break from my *so deathly toxic that it boarded on suicidal* four year [relationship](https://killtoparty.com/2020/05/03/kill-to-party/), my game was re-sharpened, I had had dates, I had had lays- I had lost about seventy pounds and had been back at my beloved, basement, gym bro gym for about a year.

**But a funny thing happens when a man finds the Manosphere-** after a tremendous degree of euphoric relief that you found OTHER PEOPLE MAKING THE SAME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT WOMEN THAT YOU'D BEEN SILENTLY COLLECTING FOR YEARS...- **you suddenly think that every bit of advice applies to you.**

And one day you learn that it doesn't.   

Unfortunately, I learned that *after* tearing a hole in my groin.

**Typically, Manosphere advice is geared toward the lowest common denominator, the** ***blue pilled as fuck*****, couch potato...** typically this advice is from men who are either still trying to climb the mountain, refine their image, and put their old self six feet in the ground- or men who had done just that, came out fucking heroes on the other end of it- and want to help the bros who need the most help. There is nothing wrong with any of that...

...but if you don't **calibrate the advice to where you are currently with** ***your own progress*** **on** ***your own journey****,* you may get TOTALLY AMPED UP in the wrong direction.

Take game, for example. My game turned to shit when I started reading about game. Why? I was already a fucking asshole! I've always been a fucking asshole! And reading endless Manosphere posts about asshole game had me AMPED to push my asshole game to its limit. I overdid it... and yeah, sometimes it was just fine, but how many times could I have gotten an easssy lay by toning it down a little bit?

**So now, I'm sitting here, pissed as fuck that I can't hit the gym** because it got in my head, when I was first reading shit on here almost ten years ago, that I wasn't pushing myself hard enough at the gym. LIFT HEAVY; PUSH IT EVERY TIME YOU'RE THERE; ANYTHING BUT PUSHING AS HARD AS YOU CAN IS A *LIMITING BELIEF.* Call me an idiot, and maybe I was- but I could see new guys taking that advice, getting amped on the Manosphere buzz, and making the mistake I did. Pushing a little too hard in 2014 and giving myself a hernia that I finally got fixed a month ago, that still fucking hurts, that I did to myself and that **I could have avoided by** ***calibrating the advice I was receiving to my own progress.***

This is my advice for you, today: assess yourself and your progress. Be honest about your weaknesses *and strengths.* If you've been a pushover with women- be more of an asshole. If your game ain't broke, don't bother fixing it. Lift consistently with good form. Find a plan that works for you. Don't rush progress, or your house of cards falls apart and you'll have to take serious time off to heal...",1638308513.0
260,Breaking the Fourth Wall,59,r5zx5y,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/r5zx5y/breaking_the_fourth_wall/,11,"*Disclaimer: this is not another post about women hitting the wall, or guide on how to escape from Mexico to the US. I know many are disappointed, but c'est la vie. For the others, I hope you’ll use this information to improve your life, business, sexual escapades or at least, be aware about it.*

&#x200B;

*The Fourth Wall* is an imaginary wall that separates the story from the real world, or the actor from the audience. This premise originated in live  theater, where the three surrounding walls enclose the stage while an invisible “4th wall” is left out for the audience/camera. Think of this as a one way mirror. In movies, the audience can see the scene and the story, but the opposite is not possible.

I can already hear the autistic screeching in the comments: *‘bro, this has nothing to do with TRP’, ‘wtf is this bullshit, not reading’, ‘how is this going to help me to fuck instahoes’*… pop some addy and keep reading. The point of Fourth Wall violation is to connect with your audience, creating bonding *intimacy* that the consumer did not expect. It makes them feel special about it, like, they are the only special snowflake in the eye of the producer. Sounds familiar, simps? I bet.

# Examples

If you do it right, breaking the Fourth Wall will evoke deeper emotions within the one on the other end. Remember the live festival you’ve been to, the singer/dj making eye contact with you? Watching a movie and suddenly, the lead actor [talking to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZL13w9TqbA&t=125s)? Getting an autograph by your favorite player, [Commercials](https://youtu.be/HZJdQnHmCpI?t=2), [Video Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpKF1GAArp4), Porn (POV, JOI), OF/IG (custom videos, gfex). You get the idea. What’s the common denominator for all of this? It’s and act, a game played on purpose to get the consumer addicted to the product and separate him from his money. This intimacy created is addictive to the mind. Many addict consume because they are lonely, desire to belong, or pure FOMO. Those people understand that the actor or the singer is ‘talking’ to other 1,000 people,but they still feel ‘special’. They feel intimate bond.

# TRP and the Fourth Wall

As I’ve mention above, it’s really easy to fall in this trap, especially if your dick’s been dry for a while, and the scarcity took over.

&#x200B;

* **Prostitutes**

I see many posts and comments about visiting a prostitute/escort if you’re in a dry spell. Up to you, but there’s a trap hidden behind the curtains (pun totally intended). It can be addictive, especially if she’s using Fourth Wall violations like affection. Many guys fall for this, even develop oneitis. It’s pure oxytocin abuse. You’re not the only one she’s doing this to. That’s how she earns for living. Same goes for strippers.

&#x200B;

* **OF/e-thots**

There’s even worse version of this – simps. They literally get obsessed over illusion, OF, e-thots, instahoes etc. They use the same tactics from above. Step by step, textbook. This creates an illusion in the simp mind, they get addicted to the image the hoe (producer) is projecting, allowing him to see what she wants him to see. The brain doesn’t give a fuck about the reality and reacts to the visual as if it’s true, be it real or pixels. So, oxytocin/dopamine/serotonin spike up. Boom, infatuation. Bonus points if mommy issues are present. But there’s a catch, it ain’t free. It’s pay to play. I remember couple of years ago, some twitter e-whore losing hundreds of thousands followers, just because she posted a pic of her bf while drunk. The thirst is real.

But wait, there’s more. You can use this to your advantage. Remember the good old push/pull tactic? There’s a reason why it works so good. When you pull, you give validation, when pushing, you withdraw and making them want more. As a high value man, you don’t have time to put some hoe on the pedestal. So, the only thing that matters is to create that spike of intimacy, so she associates the feel good emotions with you. This is basically violating, then reversing the violation of the Fourth Wall.

If you can, always go for actionable dates (climbing, hiking, skating etc). It creates strong bonding, especially with kino. Remember something about her when she’s blabbing, then use it in the right timing. Run the emotional roller-coaster, tease. Read the DEVI section in SGM, then apply. Be creative and have fun. Avoid being boring sperg, nothing dries pussy faster than that. After the high, withdraw the attention/affection, just don’t be predictable, be random. Don’t overdo it. The hamster will go on overdrive. Alpha widows are common side effects of this.

As you can see, this trap is everywhere. I hope, after reading this post, you can at least recognize it, or completely avoid.",1638313204.0
261,Pedestalization,190,r4vvhk,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/r4vvhk/pedestalization/,34," When a person subconsciously views themselves as beta, they have a natural tendency to put others on a pedestal because our subconscious minds impute magical powers to the person we determine to be the alpha of our tribe.  Our subconscious minds love the feeling that our alpha is all-powerful, has all the resources we will ever need, and loves us. Therefore, if we subconsciously categorize somebody as the alpha, we impart these characteristics to them and ignore facts that contradict this image. If the alpha treats us badly or ignores us, we subconsciously assume we deserve it and all we need to do is “correct” our behavior to get back in their good graces. We ignore the alpha’s flaws, make excuses for their behavior, and blame ourselves for the alpha’s shitty behavior. This is why abuse victims justify and rationalize what their abuser’s actions – they subconsciously see their abuser as the “alpha” so even when their logical mind realizes he is being abusive, their subconscious mind still thinks he is acting with right.

To make matters worse, humans evolved to feel like there is only one relevant tribe in the world, and therefore only one relevant alpha, so we subconsciously feel like there is nobody else capable of making us happy and if we lose our alpha we will be alone in the jungle forever. This fixation on “one” person to the exclusion of everybody else causes people to become desperate and stalkerish, even when they have lots of options. I have seen very attractive men who could fuck lots of women still lose their mind over one particular girl who did not give a fuck about them. It is wired into our DNA. To make matters worse, popular culture validates and reinforces this irrational emotion with wacky concepts like soulmates and the idea that love is a mysterious, magical force you cannot control and must give into.

Rationally, pedestalization is obviously stupid because there are plenty of fish in the sea and no one person is the source of everything we could ever want to be happy. When you take a woman off the pedestal the “magic” around her disappears and you see her for what she is: a limited human being with strengths and weaknesses, whose only value to you is how she can make your life and emotional experience better. Her pussy is just a wet hole, and while sex is fun, you can have enjoyable sex with lots of women.

Pedestalization is also repulsive to the person being pedestalized. When you subconsciously designate one person as the source of all the good in the world you emotionally overinvest in them, causing you to act beta, needy, and creepy. When you see a woman as the alpha, you supplicate to her, treat her like she is better than you, do things for her she does not deserve, and let her get away with bad behavior. Pedestalization also causes you to be anxious because humans evolved to feel anxious around the alpha so they do not say or do the wrong thing and get rejected from the tribe. This anxiety causes you to censor yourself, which is unattractive because women want a transgressive guy who does not give a fuck what anybody thinks. You cannot read a woman’s mind, so when you fear offending her you become generally boring and dull because you eliminate ANYTHING that could possibly be edgy, transgressive, or interesting. Pedestalization also puts pressure on the person being pedestalized. When you put a woman on a pedestal, you do not appreciate HER, but rather a weird character you created in your brain which is a combination of her and the archetypal alpha. Women do not want to be the alpha and do not want the pressure of being responsible for your happiness. The most common trait I see in men who are terrible with women is that they have unrealistic expectations of women, and they get angry and resentful at women for not living up to the magical image they have in their head.

To not pedestalize women, you must 1) realize that pedestalization is an irrational emotion, and not an accurate representation of reality, 2) stop treating her like the alpha by doing things she does not deserve – the more you treat her like an alpha, the more your subconscious brain assumes she is the alpha, and 3) maintain abundance with women. A man with oneitis is like a drug addict; his brain focuses on one particular path to pleasure because it feels there are no other paths. You must rewire your brain to realize there are many other paths to pleasure, and the best way to do this is to have abundance, which I explain more in the mindset chapter of this book.

Women have the same subconscious desire to pedestalize men so you must talk and act like you are already on the pedestal to appear as the alpha to her. You must act like you are the most awesome guy in the world, you have tons of options, you can make her happier than anybody else (by a long shot), and she is only fortunate enough to be in your presence because she did something significant to deserve it. You should not act like you are just one valuable guy among other valuable guys, but that you are the golden child, the special, uniquely attractive man she cannot live without. Of course, this is totally irrational – you are not that special – but by acting like the alpha you can subconsciously make her feel you are the alpha.

I want you to imagine you’re a 22 year old kissless, handholdless virgin.

You’re not even that ugly, you just couldn’t figure it out for some reason. Even though you had decent looks, good height, rich parents, and drove around in a BMW, girls simply didn’t you, in fact they didn’t want anything to do with you, not even as a friend.

Growing up, your family knew that you were fucked up so they took you to therapist after therapist but nobody was able to help.

Your Dad was so cool that he even used his connections to arrange a one on one meeting between you and a local Chad (a successful Hollywood writer) to try to help you get laid.

That didn’t work either.

What would you do in this situation?

This was the reality for a young man named Elliot Rodger and his response was to go on a mass murder spree, killing 6 people and injuring 14 others by shooting them, stabbing them, or running them over in his car. ([by the way, the part about his Dad arranging a meeting with the Hollywood Screenwriter who wrote “My Cousin Vinny” is completely true! Crazy stuff](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28197785))

Elliot Rodger, the founding martyr of the Incel Movement, was one fucked up dude.

What’s particularly interesting about him on a psychological level is that he somehow found a way to blend psychopathy, narcissism, and autism all into just one person.

Psychologists refer to it as comorbidity, where more than one mental illness is present in the same person. which in Elliot Rodger’s case, simply led to a failed human being.

He had the poor social skills and social awareness of autism, the utter lack of empathy of psychopathy, combined with the grandiose yet deeply insecure ego of a narcissist.

I’d argue that given how society tried to force feed him typical normie advice despite all his fucked up personality disorders, Elliot Rodger never had a chance.

For him, it really was already [over before it began](https://imgflip.com/i/5rdcsm)…

But it doesn’t have to be for you. The goal of this post is to construct an individual guide to each different common personality type so you don’t waste time spinning your wheels following advice that simply won’t work for you.

Keep in mind that all of these personalities are present to some degree in everyone.

It’s like a color mixer, everyone has different levels of psychopathy, narcissism, autism mixed in, the only difference is the degree.

Most people have a primary personality type but a lucky few have comorbidity like Elliot Rodger.

Not every personality style grows or achieves success in the same way so it’s very important to identify yours early so you can optimize your results.

# Neurotypical:

If you grew up with a close circle of friends that you’re still in contact with today…

If you generally like the same things that “normal” people like (football, happy hour, popular Netflix shows)…

Then consider yourself blessed.

Seriously.

Nowadays, Hollywood TV shows and entertainment tend to paint an unrealistic picture that in order to be successful, you have to have psychopathic personality traits and that if you actually have empathy, you’ll never be able to outcompete those who are willing to do whatever it takes to win.

Here’s what happens in the real world.

Having empathy is like being born a native speaker of a difficult foreign language that everybody else struggles with when they try learning it at as an adult.

You’ll have natural intuition about social situations and won’t need to constantly analyze or scheme out situations in your head in order to get ahead, since you’re relying on feel rather than analysis.

Because of this head start over other personality types, you naturally had no problem forming friendships growing up and managed to keep most of those relationships intact over the years since you have a natural aversion to fucking people over for personal gain.

Getting a girlfriend should have happened naturally while you were in High School & College.

In case it didn’t, results come quickly and easily from simply reading the Red Pill sidebar and not being a lazy fuck.

Most advice is catered towards normies because by definition most people are neurotypical. All you have to do is simply get off your lazy ass and actually do it.

Actually create a schedule and start lifting, actually start tracking macros and making sure you get enough protein in every day, actually asking out the girl that you have a crush on, actually escalating to sex instead of being too much of a pussy to make a move…

And things should improve really quickly…

**Biggest Obstacles to Success with Women:**

**1)** ***Not moving fast enough***. Typically, neurotypicals have no trouble meeting prospective girlfriends through friends or simply from dating apps but they ALWAYS make the same mistake of not moving quickly enough. You think that relationships will develop naturally over time like they did in High School and College but the truth is after College, most great long term relationships start with sex. Adults typically get into relationships after hooking up over and over again and developing feelings for each other, not by going on 7 dates and then finally having sex. If your goal is to have an amazing relationship with the woman of your dreams, you’re going to have to come to terms with the fact that the highest chance of success will come if you have sex with the girl as early and often as possible. By having sex often, the woman will start chasing you for a relationship instead of the other way around, which almost never works.

**2)** ***Not being able to let go of toxic relationships***. This is the main downfall of empathy. Neurotypicals get absolutely destroyed by toxic women (women with borderline personality disorder or other cluster B traits). The empathy makes it impossible for the neurotypical to walk away from a toxic relationship – which ironically is what you should be doing in the first place to make toxic women to actually chase you instead of the other way around. The important thing to remember is, if a stock isn’t performing, you’d drop it in a heartbeat but for some reason, you have no problem investing time, resources, and emotional energy on a woman who you know deep down in your heart is no good for you long term.

**3)** ***Feeling*** ***Guilty or Embarrassed all the time***. One of the biggest weaknesses as a neurotypical is that you’ll often keep the same social circle even as you start to achieve success yourself. You have a hard time letting go of people who are holding you back. You also have an extremely difficult time intruding on other peoples’ boundaries to get what you want, like cold approaching a girl for sex. The truth is, you don’t need to feel guilty if you go for what you want. You especially don’t need to feel guilty when you cut out old friends who are holding you back from reaching your full potential. And yes, there is a chance the girl is going to think they’re a creep if you cold approach her. But pushing through that fear is so critical to getting that fulfilling relationship you want.

**4)** ***Getting too complacent in a relationship***. *Not being able to maintain attraction in a long term relationship by being too boring.* A lot of neurotypicals love living a simple life with no long term plans or vision for the future except being happy. Unfortunately, this puts them at a disadvantage compared to other personality types like narcissists and psychopaths who often have more grandiose ambitions that pull a woman in and capture her imagination. Neurotypicals simply don’t have the ego insecurity of a narcissist to want to get famous or the greed and lust for power of a psychopath so they are much more likely to just settle into a comfortable life.

**5)** ***Trying to live a lifestyle based on what society wants instead of what you want***\*.\* Based on every neurotypical I’ve spoken to, I’d estimate that around 80-90% of neurotypical men have the end goal of getting into a passionate, meaningful long-term relationship with an amazing woman. They don’t need to have 5 plates spinning at the same time or to engage in hedonistic sex with a bunch of sloots to be fulfilled. However, because that’s the image painted by society about what constitutes a “successful man”, some neurotypicals get caught in the trap of trying to live up to society’s expectations instead of going for what they want, which is a deep connection and meaningful emotional relationship with just one woman.

**6)** ***Not looking as good as you could***\*\*.\*\* Most men dress like shit. If you’re going to put in the effort to go to the gym every day, then why wouldn’t you take less than 10 minutes every day to put on an outfit and do your hair so you can be proud of the way you look every time you go outside? Appearance is the very first thing people judge you by, it makes perfect sense to maximize it as much as possible.

**How to Succeed with Women as a Neurotypical:**

The biggest strength of a neurotypical is long term networking and the ability to leverage friends to meet women organically. In short, as gay as it sounds, the power of friendship.

Fastest way to improve with women: Move faster than you think. Modern dating in the adult world is all about speed. You can have the deepest connection with a woman but until you sleep with her, you’re just another dude.

If you want to actually lock down a girl you really like for a relationship, sleep with her as early and as often as possible. Without that, you literally have nothing of value with her and you’ll get heartbroken when she gets together with someone else who actually isn’t scared to move fast.

A neurotypical needs to realize that sleeping with a woman as soon as possible is the most efficient way towards getting into a deeply fulfilling relationship since it prevents you from wasting time and mental space on girls who are simply not into you but too polite to let you know.

# Narcissist:

Next up, we have the narcissist.

If you constantly feel the need to exaggerate your talents or accomplishments…

If you require excessive admiration from others and feel like absolute dogshit if you ever get rejected…

If you are often jealous of others who you feel like you should be better than but are somehow in higher positions…

If you just can’t resist defending yourself and your ego whenever you get attacked…

Then congratulations. You’re a narcissist.

As a narcissist, your ego is extremely fragile due to low self confidence. The bragging, the need to defend your ego… all come as a defense mechanism against getting your ego hurt.

Fortunately, while other men can’t stand dealing with narcissists, women don’t seem to mind.

In fact, guys who are primarily narcissist dominant in personality tend to enjoy the most success with women out of any other personality type.

Because you’re so insecure and care so much about what other people think about you, you learned from a very early age to either looksmax by always dressing and looking your best, or by cultivating talents that can easily be demonstrated in a large crowd for social proof.

This often results in you getting results with women at an early age compared to other men. These quick results ultimately lead to more early encouragement which means that you’re going to be more likely to stick with seduction/game compared to other men with longer learning curves.

For the most part, because modern society is so heavily looks focused, any effort spent maximizing looks is time well spent and narcissists simply have a huge leg up over the psychopath, neurotypical, and autistic types simply by grasping this very important concept.

Another side effect of caring so much about what other people think is a higher than average attention to details. This is a trait that not only leads to success with women but also leads to success in life.

So much of success in business is simply catching the right details about what will become the next trend before it actually becomes the next trend.

So much of success with women is simply making sure that you maximize your first impression by making sure that your looks, body language, vocal tonality, and social skills are on point right from the beginning, which the narcissist either does well at an early age, or is in the process of doing well since they care so much about what others think about them.

Now let’s get to some drawbacks of this personality type:

**Biggest Obstacles to Success with Women:**

**1)** ***Indecisiveness:*** Narcissists can’t stand the idea of failure in any aspect. In business, they’ll be afraid to lose money, even if there is a far greater reward if things work out. With girls, they’ll be scared to death to say the wrong thing and get rejected, leading to a lot of them adopting a “slow play” strategy with girls where they always have to wait for the next date or the next opportunity with a girl instead of going for the kill.

**2)** ***Lack of Work Ethic:*** Most narcissists I’ve met are not capable of grinding for long periods of time in any field that involves rejection without getting burnt out. Their ego simply can’t handle the no’s. With women, just like in sales, volume often beats skill. You can be the best salesman in the world but if a psychopath grinds 5X harder than you and makes 5X the number of approaches/calls as you, it doesn’t matter if you’re 3X better than him in skills, he’ll still get better results.

**3)** ***Poor Social Circle Game:*** As stated before, while girls don’t mind narcissists, other guys can’t stand you! You’ll have a difficult time forming real friendships and thus, will most likely not be able to leverage social circle game to get easy layup results with women compared to neurotypicals. The key is to transition to a more covert style of narcissism where you gradually learn to hide how you really feel from those around you. Yeah, yeah, I get it, you feel so “insulted” whenever someone even makes a slight hint of attacking you in public. But in most circumstances, it’s smarter and more effective to pretend to befriend the person than making a big show of defending your ego and making everyone dislike you.

**4)** ***Easily Manipulated:*** A narcissist is the easiest personality type to manipulate. Simply give them genuine compliments and they won’t be able to resist! As a narcissist, you should be aware that oftentimes, when people make you feel really good about yourself, it’s because they’re getting something from you. That personal trainer you hired who tells you you’re a natural at the gym? Probably manipulating you to get money. That girl who lives with you rent free but showers you with compliments every day, probably manipulating you to get a free place to stay. As a narcissist, you’d do anything for narcissistic supply, which means that people who provide it often have power over you without you knowing.

**How to Succeed with Women as a Narcissist:**

The biggest strength of a narcissist is an obsessive focus on looks combined with higher than average attention to details. In short, the power of looksmaxing.

Fastest way to improve with women: Get organized and set up a daily routine of hitting a certain amount of approaches no matter what. Narcissists typically already have all the tools to become absolute killers with women, the only thing holding them back is fear of rejection and obsessing that every detail has to be perfect instead of just grinding.

Narcissists typically get results really really quickly whenever they are on a set routine that they follow no matter what – whether it’s gym, girls, or money, because they naturally pay attention to crucial details that other personality types miss and have the ability to make adjustments to fit other people’s needs.

What a narcissist needs to realize is that in any area of life, whether it’s business or women, consistency beats brilliance over the long term. Doesn’t matter what you’re doing, if you’re not consistent and give up on things when they get hard and can no longer feed your narcissistic supply, you won’t make it in any endeavor long term.

A narcissist really starts to take off when they either force themselves to cultivate incredible self discipline or better yet, find something they’re so passionate about that they never lose interest even in the hard times when they don’t get the praise they’re dying to get from others.

# Psychopath:

Next up, we have the psychopath, the “coolest” personality type to be today based on what the media tells you.

Do you do extremely well under pressure when most people would crumble under stress?

Do you go to sleep every night feeling absolutely no guilt, regardless of how many people you fucked over that day?

Do you just straight up feel like you’re superior to everyone around you, even if there’s no objective proof?

Are you straight up unaffected by rejection to the point where you can get 100 times in a row by women you cold approach with zero negative psychological consequences?

Do you really not give a fuck about other people but always felt like you were clever or cunning enough to manipulate others into thinking you cared about them?

Do you straight up feel no deep emotions whatsoever (never ever get depressed) and can only generate shallow emotions like anger?

If so, you’re a psychopath.

As a psychopath, you have one quality that no other personality type can ever hope to match and that’s consistency.

When you set your mind on something, come hell or high water, you’re going to get it. It doesn’t matter how many people get hurt around you, hell, it doesn’t even matter what kind of pain you yourself go through, you’ll get what you want or die trying.

All of this combined with a lack of emotional response to positive or negative events compared to everyone else means that you can grind for extended periods of time without losing motivation or burning out.

You’re the one personality type that can actually approach 20-40 girls a day for an entire year. You’re the one personality type that can actually do 200 cold calls a day without giving a fuck about getting rejected.

And oddly enough, psychopaths do extremely well in long term relationships since they naturally follow the Principle of Least Interest – whoever has the least amount of interest in continuing a relationship has the most power over it. Since you truly don’t give a fuck about anyone except for yourself, there’s no need to even fake not being interested in other people, it’s simply who you really are.

And unfortunately… that’s where the positives end…

You see, most psychopaths don’t end up achieving any kind of success like in the movies. You may think that being a psychopath makes you a future CEO since herp derp CEO is the profession with the most psychopaths!!

You may even think that worst comes to worst, you can become a criminal since the prison population is full of psychopaths!

But what really ends up happening is that just like everyone else, you’ll most likely just end up as an ordinary person with an ordinary job and ordinary prospects with women.

You’re not special.

The only difference is, because you don’t feel empathy, you had a much harder learning curve growing up compared to others when it comes to social awareness.

That being said, because you deeply value money and power, you most likely realized that in order to get both, you have to learn social skills to blend in.

Either you went through that blending in process successfully at an early age or you didn’t.

If you didn’t, you end up with a borderline autistic adult who has no friends and isn’t particularly good at anything but who thinks he’s the greatest at whatever he touches (usually something involving vidya games)

Also, while having extraordinary persistence and determination is generally a very good quality to have, it’s borderline useless if you combine it with a lack of attention to details and an inability to make adjustments when necessary.

Every single time, without fail, whenever I talk to someone who has made 100 cold approaches but failed to get laid once, it’s a psychopath. A psychopath is one of the only personality types who will be retarded enough to try the exact same thing 100 times or even 1000 times in a row without making any adjustments whatsoever.

They somehow believe the world should conform to them instead of the other way around. With this kind of attitude, not only do you make zero progress from all this hard work of going out and getting rejected, but you actually make NEGATIVE progress since you’re ingraining bad habits into your memory that will be extremely difficult to undo later on.

As a psychopath, you genuinely believe that you’re superior to other people, yet all this does it lead to a “it’s good enough” attitude to everything you do.

Your appearance ends up looking careless and disheveled because “oh well, whatever I wear is good enough”

You walk up to girls 20 times, get rejected 19 times and don’t even stop to consider that it might be because you didn’t take the time to put on a nice outfit and get a trendy haircut before going out.

Hell, you probably didn’t even take time to analyze your mistakes from a game perspective.

Instead, all you do is move on to the next approach like a robot, because who gives a fuck about rejection? All you need to do is make enough approaches! A lay is right around the corner, right?

**Here are some of the biggest shortcomings holding psychopaths back from success with women:**

***Not Giving a Fuck about Appearance***: For some reason, every other personality type at least understands that you need to put some basic effort into physical appearance before you go out to approach women. Even incels realize the importance of looks. Yet psychopaths love to get sucked into weird theories that you can seduce any woman if your game is good enough and that looks don’t matter. Fact of the matter is, you can be Don Juan reincarnated. In 2021, it doesn’t fucking matter. You’re not getting laid on a consistent basis if you go out wearing whatever feels comfortable instead of looking your best.

Simply getting a proper haircut that’s faded on the sides and back, and wearing layered outfits will yield immediate improvements in the way people respond to you. You spend all this time learning about seduction or manipulation techniques like 48 Law of Power or Passing Shit Tests, why the fuck wouldn’t you invest time and energy into the ONE THING that actually counts most for success with women – your appearance!

The way forward is to be more like Patrick Bateman, less like Ariel Castro. Every single time without fail whenever someone complains to me that they made 100 approaches and only got laid once, it’s always a psychopath or autistic personality type since no other personality type would even have the patience to go through that much rejection for such little results.

***Lack of Conscientiousness:*** Because you don’t give a fuck about what other people think of you, you’re less likely to care about the quality of your work when you’re delivering projects to clients or taking care of your appearance before you go out to approach girls. It goes without saying but you’ll never succeed in any area of your life whether is working out, building a business, or with women if you don’t care about whether or not you do a quality job and simply think everything you do is “good enough”.

***Lack of Attention to Details***: Another huge problem with the psychopathic personality type is that important details are often neglected due to brain wiring. Things that other people catch immediately are simply not even noticed by the psychopath. If the girl is feeling scared, neurotypicals or even narcissists can sense it and will make a comment to diffuse the tension. Meanwhile, the psychopath keeps running his shitty version of game over and over again, not giving any fucks what the girl is feeling, which eventually leads to yet another rejection.

***Ego too high to learn from people who may be trying to help you***\*:\* As a psychopath, you’ve never experienced a moment of imposter syndrome. You have the opposite problem, thinking you already know everything and that they know better than other people. The truth is, while most people are as useless as you imagine, there are a few who know significantly more about women or making money than you could ever hope to achieve. The fastest way to get better at anything is through a mentor. The sooner you can temporarily let go of your ego and reach out for help from the right places, the sooner you can actually start getting results instead of doing the same thing over and over again and getting nowhere.

***Monotone delivery***\*:\* Because you feel less emotions than others, you don’t really convey any sort of emotion in your voice either. Unlike other people, where there’s a range of loud and quiet, high and low, your voice is monotone as fuck. It’s like you’re speaking in black and white while others are speaking in color. Since you lack empathy, it also never occurred to you that in a noisy environment like on the streets for a cold approach, you have to talk 2X louder and 2X slower than normal so the other person can actually understand what you’re saying instead of constantly saying “What??” In fact, this might be thing easiest thing you can test for yourself right now as a psychopath. Go out and talk 2X louder and 2X slower than normal and you should see an immediate improvement in the way other people respond to you.

***Overconfidence*** – Attributing any success to inherent greatness instead of doing the work. Psychopaths usually do a terrible job of analyzing mistakes or analyzing victories, not because they’re inherently bad at it but because they don’t even bother! They simply don’t replay events in their mind like a neurotypical or narcissist would. They go to sleep every night without a care in the world. Every success is because they’re inherently great. Every failure – eh who gives a fuck, on to the next victim! What psychopaths need to realize is that no one is fundamentally great. Great results are achieved by hard work and because someone caught important details that most other people were not aware of. Failures happen for the opposite reason – not putting in enough work or doing the wrong actions and taking the wrong advice – aka catching the wrong details. One of the best ways to improve is to simply journal every day as gay as it sounds since it allows you to go over your mistakes and victories so you don’t repeat mistakes over and over again.

**How to Succeed with Women as a Psychopath:**

The biggest strength of a psychopath is relentless consistency. You don’t experience the ups and downs that other personality types do. Make sure you’re actually using that quality to your advantage instead of wasting time on petty schemes or playing vidya games all day.

Starting out, you may get rejected quite a lot simply because of appearance. Take time to really nail it. And remember that it’s not about what you think looks good, it’s about what girls think.

Don’t be afraid to reach out for help from others who have what you want. If someone else has really good fashion and has a lot of girls interested in him, try to bring them on as a mentor. It’s far easier than you think because people love feeling like experts. Simply implement whatever they tell you to do and report back with results. Guaranteed the mentor will be absolutely thrilled because 95% of people take advice and don’t do anything with it!

Recognize that even though you may have to approach more girls and have a steeper learning curve than every other personality type, you’ll have significant advantages once you actually lock in a plate or Long-Term-Relationship.

Girls may be creeped out by you when you first approach them since they can tell something is off about you but as soon as you fuck a girl enough times, she’ll be your little puppet to do whatever you want with. They won’t be able to escape because you don’t give a fuck about them, so you have all the power.

My final bit of advice for psychopaths out there is that almost all of the mainstream self help stuff out there is not just useless for you – it’s actively harmful.

Your problem was never about not having enough confidence or not knowing your own value.

Your problem is the complete opposite – being an overconfident fuck who overvalues himself and his own abilities. All reading self help books will do is make you love the smell of your own farts instead of actually finding a mentor who will correct all those mistakes you’re making so you can actually go to the next level.

On a final note, you may think you’re cunning as fuck and that nobody can see through your mask but I’d say for 95% of psychopaths I’ve ever met, everyone can see right through them!

Really take time to analyze how people respond to you. If you never get promoted or offered leadership positions at work and have no long term friends, just a series of short term acquaintances, then that means you have a shitty mask.

EVERYONE can see right through you so it’s time to really analyze what you’re doing wrong so you can actually achieve the kind of success you dream about.

# Autist:

Do people around you get weirded out because you can’t keep eye contact or have weird body language or facial expressions that don’t make sense?

Do you have obsessive interests in obscure fields that you go FULL tunnel vision on?

Do you absolutely have to follow certain routines, even if they make no logical sense like making sure to clap your hands a certain way to spin in a circle whenever a specific action happens to you?

If so, congratulations, you may be Autistic!

This post is already way too long.

As I was writing, the Autist section came out to 20+ pages of advice and observations. I truly put my heart and soul into this because I know a lot of people with autism who struggle with girls and don’t have any resources to point them in the right direction, least of all from mainstream normie advice…

Therefore, I’ve uploaded everything you need to know if you fit into this personality type into a TRP.Red post that you can access here:

[Link to 20 Page Document about How to Improve as an Autist](https://imgflip.com/i/5vti8m)

>!LOL JUST KIDDING! There’s no hope if you’re an autist! It’s over for you before it even began! My only serious advice would be to follow all of the psychopath advice since their path to improvement is about the same as yours, just yours will be even harder since you have naturally weird body language.!<

# Conclusion:

I truly hope nobody on this subreddit goes Elliot Rodger. I know that there’s plenty of people wallowing in depression or stuck on an endless loop, putting in effort but getting very little results.

I was totally joking about autism. I’ve seen plenty of people with autism or aspergers overcome their weaknesses through relentless self analysis and help from others.

If you have comorbidity (more than one personality disorder at the same time) read through both as you’ll most likely need to implement strategies from both in order to truly take off and get results.

Always remember that you have natural strengths that your personality type allows you to tap into in times of greatest need.

The greatest strength of a neurotypical is the ability to leverage long term relationships. This is why most millionaires are neurotypicals, since the other personality types have a hard time building a team that works together towards a common goal.

The greatest strength of a narcissist is attention to detail. You just knew how important things like appearance, social status, and cultivating attention grabbing talents were from an early age so you most likely got laid way before all the other personality types.

The greatest strength of a psychopath is relentless consistency. The ability to go after what you want without giving a fuck about who gets in the way or gets hurt in the process, even if it’s yourself that gets hurt! That kind of consistency is extremely potent when combined with a more humble approach that actually goes over what went wrong each time instead of mindless grinding.

The greatest strength of an autist is that you can hyperfocus on 1 or 2 narrow fields of interest and tunnel in a way no other personality type will ever catch up in that field. Better make sure that field is something you can make money in like computer programming.

Whenever you feel too discouraged, remember that it can always be worse and that you could have more than 3 personality disorders at the same time!

Important Reminder.",768,r31g82,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/r31g82/women_dont_want_to_grow_with_you_they_are_waiting/,196,"How many times have you heard women saying, I want to ""grow"" with a man and help him out in his journey of whatever it is? Of course never. The reality is, as we all know, women in the modern age want to have it their way In everything. You can't have your cake and eat it too. 

For many men, they are told by society and everyone to ""work hard"" and be ""established."" Indeed. But, established and successful for what? For themselves? Nope. Men are programmed from a very young age by society, to be a beta buxx and are prepared for it from a very young age. While you are working so hard, day and night to money maxx, your future wife is getting pounded by broke Tyrone's day and night. Yes gentlemen, this is the reality. I remember back in HS I used to have a job as a busser. And there was this dishwasher (bad boy type guy with tattooes and all) and this guy literally didn't give a fuck about anything. I remember, he used to brag about piping down the hot waitresses, and he was very well liked. Even by the milf manager. From that point on, I realized that women will fuck any guy that gets them wet when they're horny, and not care about his status. 



 Women in their youth have everything they need and want, funded by their father's. At this time, she's not wanting a beta buxx husband. Why? Because her material needs are met. You know what she wants? She want to get degraded by many tyrones and chad's and the whole football team in many ways as possible. Yes. Most men cannot handle this or accept it, but that's what's happening gentlemen. And you? You're still working your ass off, not for yourself, but rather for your future wife and kids that you think will make your life better. Little do you know, you're her last beta buxx option after she got used and degraded by many men, in many ways possible, and now is a emotionally damaged man hating feminist, who wants YOU to save her. Why? Because you now are fully established and at the finish line, and she's waiting for you there. 

And you know what? I don't get suprised anymore, when men on here say, their wife was banging the guy next door, while he was working his ass off for his family. You see gentlemen, for sex, a women doesn't care who she has it with. Why? Because every guy wants sex with her and she will only choose the most sexually capable. But, for marriage? Nope. She will choose the man with the most resources and who is most stable in life, aka you. It's not because she loves you or anything, nor does she appreciate the hard work you did to get there. She is just happy she got a ""lifelong"" comfortable income guy that will provide her with her material needs.

 For sex? She has the next door neighbor who will bang her for free, while you paid for her in marriage and did everything for that. Sadly, most men are dumb asf. I blame men. They have given up their principal's, morals, ethics for women and a so called ""good"" wife. You must acknowledge, if you marry in the modern age, you are nothing but a beta buxx in her eyes. I liked the post here which was titled, ""Today's women is yesterday's prostitute."" Women openly display their nature and hoeing around on social media. Literally, they don't even hide it anymore. Because they innately know, no matter how much she exposed herself, there will always be a desperate sucker who will put the ring on her, no matter how much her body count was.



She will lose respect for you in no time, and she will fantasize the QB from her university who she fucked, while having sex with you, becausec she has experienced it all! Don't lose your self respect gentlemen. These women aren't worthy enough to even spend a single penny on. Work hard, and make money only for yourselves and self improvement. And with that money, change the life of others who are really and in desperate need, so they will actually remember you. Unlike a women, who you can do anything for, and if you don't do that 1 thing, she will say ""What good have you ever done for me?"" 

Most religions say most inhabitants of hell will be women, and indeed this makes sense now, and no matter whatever religion we are, we all come together in this regard because each religion has said the same regarding the true nature of women. 

 Tldr; Marriage = nothing more than beta buxx and a slave to her and the government. Don't marry. There is no unicorn.",1637975017.0

It's video games. You knew [this was coming, boys.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3EYLA_SoPQ)

Why do you still play video games anon?

So many reasons to quit, so let's start with the obvious one:

&#x200B;

**The Golden Age of video games is over.**

Video games used to made by gamers for gamers. Now it’s just corporate execs releasing annual products for their consumers.

Years ago, those gamers weren’t implementing loot boxes, micro transactions or even thinking about a sequel, they just wanted to make a good game. They were just passion projects. Now, it's thoroughly controlled by corporate executives.

And what do they do?

They nickle and dime ghey-mers and wait until next year to do it all over again. Putting trans black soldiers in a WW2 game isn’t what a gamer does, it’s what a corporate executive does. Making your protagonist a trans person isn't what gamer implements, it's what a corporate executive implements. Swapping nazi swastikas for an iron cross isn't what a gamer thinks of, it's what a corporate executive thinks of pander to the new generation of ghey-mers, who more and more look like [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fknowyourmeme.com%2Fphotos%2F1897818-soy-boy-face-soyjak&psig=AOvVaw3XKB9GkQIfS2Qr6ip2cf9f&ust=1637874660209000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAgQjRxqEAoMCBQVAAAAAB0AAAAAEBQ). It has been replaced by extortionate micro transaction systems and deluded historical revisionism such as black WW1 soldiers, or trans propaganda.

Can't you see it? Games prioritise virtue signalling, nickel and diming over good quality games, and yet you still play them. Why?

I'll tell you why. Because deep down, you are **still trying to chase that high** you got from them when you were 12-16. Those first moments when you first picked up gaming. You keep buying new releases annually, only be disappointed, swear them off and then come November, do it all over again. You try to relive the glory days, the highs you got, but deep down, you know they are **truly gone.** They died when gaming became corporatised, but you lie to yourself...you hope those meanie executives will finally listen and give you the game you first played.

&#x200B;

Newsflash bro: **it ain't coming.**

&#x200B;

The personal passion project type of video games are dead. There is no way you can describe any major title as ""personal passion projects"" unless you are high, and if so, pass me the blunt brah. Surely, you noticed this decline in quality too right?

But maybe you never got to experience the golden age. Maybe you never got to experience people calling you the naughty word over the mic whilst claiming to have banged your mom, and this current age is all you know, making what I'm describing foreign to you. Or maybe you just don't have the vision I have, I mean, I am a God after all, so it's cool.

&#x200B;

Don't fret, I still got you fam.

&#x200B;

Ask yourself, after playing your favourite video game, how do you **really** feel?

Do you feel elated? Do you feel like a ""high""?

If you are honest with yourself, you don't. You just feel drained/tired.

Compare that to coming back from a workout, its **nowhere** near the same. The workout literally took from you, it took your sweat, energy and your mental focus for 1-2 hours, and yet you feel like a Demi god right after. You gained more than you lost.

&#x200B;

What did the video games take?

Fucking nothing. All you had to do was sit on your ass and play, and you STILL didn't gain anything from it. No sense of elation, nothing. You lost more than you gained. Try it out next time you play, see how you feel after. **Empty/fleeting** would be the word you'll look for.

Here's something else you can try. Try to remember what it was like playing a few days ago or a week ago. Don't just try to vaguely ""remember"" it, try to remember the exact details of what was happening, how many kills you got, the matches you played and how you felt.

**You can't**. Gaming doesn't even get saved as a distinct experience in our brains. It's just a vague blur. In a way, its almost as if it never happened. You can remember banging that Spring Break Hoe but you can't even remember last week's gaming session.

&#x200B;

Compare that to your last workout or last week's bang. You remember so many more details. You can still remember what you were squatting last week, or benching last month, how hard it felt and how much easier it feels recently.  **It happened.**

That bitch you fucked 2 weeks ago, you still remember her. You even think about her when you bang someone else and convince yourself it's her. Hell, even the bitch still remembers. She remembers being fucked and will always remember being fucked (no matter how she pretends she doesn't remember or add it to her n count). Bitches are dumb, but they aren't that dumb.

&#x200B;

Every year, you grind and grind on the latest instalment; unlock all kinds of things, level up your characters only for it to count for nothing by next year when they release the next instalment of their franchise. Your work almost gets **completely undone.**

(Side note: there’s some interesting psychology happening here. Why do men grind so much on video games? Doesn't it get stressful? Who would want to put themselves through such hardship just to unlock shit on video games? Well, men are human doings. They derive purpose and pleasure through conquering and doing. Why do you think games never give you everything unlocked right off the bat and say “*Well, go have your fun now. You have everything you need”*. Because guys don't have fun like that. They get it through grinding and working for those unlocks, video games know this and hijack this to hook guys and make them play for hours).

Again, compare to that to the gym. Your grinding in the gym visibly and numerically pays off, your muscles get bigger and stronger. Last year's work is not only NOT counting for nothing but instead actively counting towards your goal. How will you bench 315 if you never went through the year of only benching 250? Hell, even if you fall off the wagon and stop working out for a while, muscle memory will kick in when you return because of last year's work. If you benched 275 in the past, you still benched 275, the work **doesn't** somehow get undone. Similar thing with a bitch, if you fucked her last year, you still fucked her last year. Its not like she gets unfucked.

So as you can see, what even is the point of playing video games? What is the point of all this grinding? What is the point of playing if you can hardly remember what it felt like? Do you see the futility of it? **Or do you just choose not to?**

&#x200B;

Here's a quick litmus test.

Just ask yourself, ""**am I playing too much video games**."" It's as simple as that. A lot of you aren't where you want to be financially, physically or sexually, and so instinctively, you will know the answer, it will be like a reflex. Any deviation from this answer is a ghey rationalisation you use to hide from the truth. (*Think about this before you come in the comment section defending your ghey video games).*

There will be a minority who can genuinely say ""no I don't"". And to them, I sincerely tell them to keep doing what they are doing. But this is a **tiny minority** of people.

&#x200B;

**You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it.**

&#x200B;

There’s really no better time to give up video games. They are shit now, they don't do anything for you, they leave you empty AND there are so many other things that require your attention...productive things. You can easily replace video games with something else, and naturally you will. You think you will just stand there idly during the time you were meant to be gaming? Hell no, you will find something else.

If you genuinely do find yourself twiddling your thumbs during the time you normally would be gaming, here are some ideas:

Go for a hike, meet up with an old friend, go on a date with a girl you aren't too sure about...maybe you'll find she's not too bad, start a side hustle, look into crypto, do some stretches (a lot of you guys are inflexible as fuck), go do some cardio (don't think I don't see you guys skipping cardio, refer to my cardio post on the best forms), read some posts on the main sub by your favourite posters (like me of course).

&#x200B;

Here's the thing, you will NEVER regret not playing enough video games. **Nobody** at 80 is dying thinking ""*damn, I wish I played more video games.*""

&#x200B;

Here's what they do regret:

\- Not having fucked enough bitches. Not having enough stories about of the escapades he had.

\-Not having built a good physique. [Imagine dying without never having seen your body at its peak.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F512847476292061055%2F&psig=AOvVaw3C5Pr66y5fMNsiER7OsRSn&ust=1637955947045000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAgQjRxqFwoTCNj318WjtPQCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)Couldn't be me.

[""But...but...moderation Apollo. Please let me play my video games. I promise I will only play a bit, I'm not like those betas who can't control themselves.""](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0cdfed8813947b242680c34124858100-lq)

**Tempting , but no.**

A lot of you are vehemently anti porn. Even if moderation was proposed, a lot of you would say ""No, just cut it out completely."" Why? Because you know porn is poison. Poison is still poison regardless of dose. Same thing with alcohol and drugs, a lot of you propose you going cold turkey on these things, but yet you struggle to say the same for video games. Why is giving up video games your kampf, but not alcohol or drugs, at least those 2 typically happen in social environments unless you are a total loser and doing those alone in a basement. But in that case, wtf bro?

A lethal dose of polonium is about 50ng, would you still propose having this at moderation? Say, 1ng or 0.5ng? No, you wouldn't. Poison is still poison regardless of dose. Why the fuck would you take it?

So the real question isn't about everything in moderation (including poison), but rather can you afford it? If you are an alcoholic, you can't afford the poison alcohol. If you have a compulsive eating disorder, you can't afford the poison McDonalds. **And, if you aren't where you want to be currently, then you can't afford video games.**

&#x200B;

Deep down, a lot of you know I'm right. **Any contradicting retort is simply a rationalisation used to hide from the truth.** So this Black Friday, do yourself a favour: don't buy the latest vidya game, don't buy the GheyStation 5 or the latest NoSexBox 360. It's just going to a huge time sink a lot of you can't afford.

266,Why you need to track what you consume.,126,r2n49k,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/r2n49k/why_you_need_to_track_what_you_consume/,31,"It's been 3 years since my last TRP post. Figured I might chip in again and try to get some healthy discussion about lifting going.

Everyone knows the essentials of building up mass by now. Getting in enough calories. Consuming 1 gram of protein per lb of bodyweight. However, without measurement, you won’t know what the hell you’re doing or what you’re putting in your body.

This is why you **MUST** count your calories, or at the very minimum keep track of what you are ingesting.

# 1. You are terrible at guessing

We are all like the 400lbsers on TV claiming they don't eat that much. You can't guess how many calories were in one meal, let alone a whole day of eating.

Naturally skinny? You'll eat too little.

Naturally overweight? You'll eat too much.

Some people can get away with it. But chances are that they have learnt to eyeball portion sizes by first counting them religiously.

# 2. Silence your bitch-voice

Your bitch-voice says: ""I did enough for today.""

**You didn't.**

Your daily calorie goal is telling you that to your face when you count and measure. Don't rely on your internal voice telling you whether you are on the right track. It lies to you.

Use systems to place your goals and goal-tracking outside of yourself.

This way you can confront yourself when your bitch-voice starts talking again. Write the goal down. Track your progress. Confront yourself with it every day.

# 3. Avoid the Yo-Yo Effect

You overeat when bulking. You undereat when cutting.

You will go from skinny to fat and back again.

This is not why you train. You want to look great and feel strong year-round. Counting calories gives you absolute control over your physique, and strength.

# 4. Adaptability is KEY

Humans are not static beings who need X calories indefinitely.

You have active days and inactive days. And your body adjusts to your calorie intake over time. You are not gaining or losing weight as much as you want to...

Without counting calories, how are you going to adjust? You are now back at guessing how much you need to eat to reach your goal. **NOT going to work.**

You must count calories to adjust to changing energy needs to keep losing fat or gaining muscle. This ensures you reach your goals.

267,Is it really better to be red pilled?,192,r23ym6,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/r23ym6/is_it_really_better_to_be_red_pilled/,136," **A few nights ago,** I recorded a podcast with a few guys who are very into both the manosphere and the new genre of *manosphere inspired* underground literature that people seem to be excited by. Since I identity as being part of both emerging movements- movements that will only gain momentum in the coming decade- they had me on. We discussed the manosphere to underground literature pipeline.

As an ice-breaker, a question they almost assuredly thought was a throw-away; a softball; a little bit of brick-laying in order to get to other, more interesting questions... **they asked if I thought red pill knowledge was a necessity; if, in order to be successful, men** ***needed*** **to be red pilled...**

# I didn't know how to answer.

I said to make art. To write shit that people find interesting; emotionally honest; intellectually resonating, that you should be *red pilled* on female nature. But the word *successful* hung in the air- silently taunting.

I didn't know how to answer. I thought about my life- where things are currently; where things went wrong; the trajectory of how I set things right. **The manosphere was integral in that trajectory. I needed to understand the nature of how women love**; learning that immunized myself from ever needing a woman to love me. I guess I can still appreciate it if it ever happens again.

My *game* was just fine before the manosphere- if anything, for a prolonged period of several years it had gotten worse; I got too *in my head*. I second guessed my reactions to things; my responses; my words. I became more of an asshole. This is not a problem for most people, but if you're already an asshole you'll likely end up overdoing it. I overdid it.

Then I thought about [Nancy](https://killtoparty.com/2020/04/01/zenith-the-low-hum-of-a-blank-screen/). I thought about [Blair](https://killtoparty.com/2021/02/25/after-hours/). I thought about turning forty, and I thought about the very last *red pill* I took... maybe one I didn't need. Maybe one red pill too many. Maybe the most important red pill:

# Women buy what they can afford.

**If you aren't a man who women are throwing themselves at to begin with....** and if you're here- if you had to learn game- you probably aren't... **you may still get laid; you may still get a girlfriend; you may still do well, but you'll never be the one she really wants- you're the one she can afford.**

If you're not the man she really wants, your relationship will be- to some extent- transactional. To some extent, you'll need to jump through hoops- be it with financial support, or gaining social status, or by performing the clown show called game. To some extent, your relationship will be inauthentic; to some extent she's your prostitute.

This red pill can rightfully be called the *real red pill-* and **are men better off for taking it?**

# I don't know how to answer that.

I wrote an essay called [**""The King of Hell""**](https://killtoparty.com/2020/11/07/the-king-of-hell/) upon first making this realization. That now, at forty, I can have fun fucking an infinite number of women who *afford me* as the best they can do- granted, for my age, I'm in excellent shape- I'm not a terrible version of the best anyone can do. There is satisfaction in fucking these women, but the other end of it is being aware of how it all works....

**Society was structed in a way that men did not have to be red pilled.** People married young and never looked back; divorce was difficult to obtain and there were strict social taboos on female promiscuity. **A man a hundred years ago would likely have died believing his wife truly loved him**\- that they had a *true love story*\- that it was all real, everything authentic. Hell, maybe she even thought so too- maybe she didn't know the difference. **Maybe naivete all around is for the best.**

That isn't a world that exists anymore. There is no returning. There will never be- without extreme hardship and pervasive violence. I don't want that either.

**But, I think... what if I didn't know these things.... then what?**

# I don't have an answer for that.

Maybe things could have worked out, and I'd never know the difference. Maybe not knowing would have ruined me... maybe I'd have done the whole shebang- the wedding, the kids- and ran that relationship into the ground, like every relationship I'd had before being red pilled... maybe it's better to know the truth and write about it.

It's a question that I'll die thinking about.",1637867436.0
268,The Number 1 Mistake That Majority of Men Make.,329,r1j140,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/r1j140/the_number_1_mistake_that_majority_of_men_make/,41,"As you are growing up, whether it's society, your parents, relatives, or anyone, they have all these expectations from you. Every person who gives you any advice regarding life and success, their definition and meaning of ""success"" is very different.  For a majority of parents, their meaning of success is you gaining a degree and being ""set"" in your life, and then finding a good wife and having kids. That's ""success"" in their eyes. In the eyes of society, for a man to be successful, is being rich and having a harem of beautiful women combined with many different sports cars.


**The point is when you come into this life, each and every person has different expectations from you regarding their own view of the world**. As you are ingrained from a very young age regarding this fake meaning of ""success"" by all these people, you then chase after this ""success"" which, ironically, is the expectations others have of you, which doesn't even bring peace to yourself. You want to buy all those sports cars and that mansion not because you deeply desire it, but rather to prove to society that you have ""succeeded"" in regards to their definition of your success. 


I know just too many people that have bought all these expensive cars on finance etc and they legit don't even have enough to put in the gas tank. They live paycheck to paycheck but for the Instagram likes and validation of others, they have given priority in pleasing the expectations others have of them, rather than pleasing their own selves and what brings them that inner peace. And, this is the case for the majority of men. 

**Men have been programmed to obey, listen and please others, while sacrificing their own goals and ambitions for the expectations that others/society has for them.** You then keep chasing and chasing this false view that you have of ""success"" only to be dissatisfied and never fulfilled, because you never wanted that in the first place. 

The point is gentlemen, don't conform to the expectations of society and people have of you. No matter what you do you in your life, whether it's good or bad, everyone will always have something to say. **You cannot please everyone and you cannot keep them all happy. If you do this, people will then ask, ""Why didn't you do that?"" If you do that, then they will ask, ""Why didn't you do this?""**

**The number 1 mistake that most men make is, they sacrifice their own ambitions and goals to please others, while forgetting themselves. And by the time they wake up and realize all this, it's too late.** And, all the people they wanted to impress never cared anyway. Because certainly in today's world, who has the time to? **The same people you tried to ""impress"" will one day leave you in the grave, and go on with their lives.**


 1 of My favorite quotes of all time is from the Movie Wall Street. Where 1 of the character says, ""Man looks in the abyss, and there's nothing staring back at him. At that moment, man finds his character. And that is what keeps him out of the abyss."" Indeed. **Only when we look at the abyss, that's when we reflect and realize how much delusion we were in.**

 In conclusion gentlemen, don't put your purpose of life in what others want you to do and achieve. Rather, do what you have to do. Of course, on the journey to find your inner peace and happiness, you will overcome many obstacles, pain and suffering. But what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger. And whatever you may face, it will only add on to the list of experiences in life which you will learn from. Take advice from gentlemen that you consider wise, and always keep an open mind. Because there is always something to learn from everyone. There will always be a person smarter, stronger and wealthier than you. Don't let your ego come in the way, making you lose valuable wisdom that you may gain.  

In the end, listen to everyone, extract all the knowledge you possibly can, and live life on your own terms. Never let anyone dictate how you live your life, and never take shi from anyone.",1637799043.0
269,Growing out of the improvement cocoon,97,r049gz,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/r049gz/growing_out_of_the_improvement_cocoon/,10,"Tldr at bottom because this came out like a novel. 

It’s always hard figuring out the right way to word these sorts of things, what kind of frame to take? How will it be perceived? Is it another post in the countless wall of posts that parrot the same talking points over and over? Do I have anything unique to contribute?

There are a million posts on TRP and in self improvement circles in general trying to sell you this idea or that idea, and overall there’s this trap of “self-betterment” that is so easy to fall into. 

I guess I’ll just try and keep this authentic, and share the thought, to escape that self improvement bubble, and form your own idea, and be your own person. Not just a collection of tactics, pieces and strategies with the self improvement brand duct tape of holding it together. 

When I first started with TRP and self improvement it was this great spiral. Self discovery, great habits, “betterment”. Finances in order, improving my physical look, great habits. Becoming more of a man. You name it, I had it. 

You get on this, “I’m holier than thou”. I can bust your shit test. I cut out negativity. Im forcing my own positivity. Perfect diet. Perfect life. Whatever. Fueled by the ego hiding in the closet, the rage of your blue pulled days. You are trapped in the eternal struggle to “find perfection” rather than seeing the greatness around you. 

But as you dig deeper you uncover all of the different paths out there, because self improvement is more of a tree than a road and it branches out. 

Your path isn’t linear. 

And one day you see that your room is clean and your closet is full. You keep piling up these parts of you, that you want to hide. But they’re still there, because you’re not just a self improvement robot.

You get stuck in a routine - daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and it’s easy to force this sort of ideal upon yourself. I’ve got to have a perfect house, because that’s what all of this self improvement stuff says I’m supposed to have.

But that’s not it.

You need to go through that closet. You need to integrate what is actually in there with who you are now. It’s okay to fail shit tests, to be alone, to not be this multi-billion dollar guru, this charismatic leader, to violate any trp principal, you name it. 

Because it’s not about morality, it’s about reality. 

You need to accept both the negative and positive thought process, the masculine and feminine, the yin and yang. Because they are the same, and they are you. And they are humanity. They aren’t moral. They just exist.

It’s okay to not have a perfect house, because the point isn’t to have a perfect house, because there is no possible objective standard for perfection you can ever truly reach, but a house that you enjoy. A good place to lay your head. 

The striving for perfection is the anthesis to good. 

Go live your life. I mean truly live YOUR life, using what works best for YOU. 

Some people are extroverted, I’m not. Some people are charismatic, I’m not. Some people are mathematical, some are historians. Everybody has different strengths and weakness’, that’s what makes us human. 

That’s okay. Play to your strengths and not your weakness’. Don’t be the best version of someone else’s vision, because you can’t and you won’t ever live up to their ideal. Be the best version of yourself. 

Some people say TRP is a toolkit, but if you spend all your time cultivating a toolkit, you’re going to die the best equipped carpenter, with the most empty funeral, in the world.

That isn’t to say, cultivating your toolkit isn’t important. There are times when you need to cut wood or saw. But there are times too, when you need to eat or sleep or play. 

Life was made to be lived. Shut off the noise and live it.

Tldr; Don’t let the perceptions of anybody else dictate your reality. There is no true objective redpill ideal, just the subjective opinions of those around you. There is no true “redpill”, just that which exists. So go live your own reality not somebody else’s, what truly works best for YOU.",1637639799.0
270,The Girlfriend Experience is for sale - The Boyfriend Experience is not.,443,qztsdj,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qztsdj/the_girlfriend_experience_is_for_sale_the/,144,"Today apparently is one of those days I woke up and decided to wear my 'toxic masculinity' shirt.

It is often brought up on this sub that 'you are the prize' and 'commitment is something a woman must earn'. I'll try driving the point home a little further.

A realization hit me a couple days ago;

**The Girlfriend Experience is for sale - The Boyfriend Experience is not.**

What are things universally desired by men that (smart) women know how to offer and get the guy to stay (for a long time/indefinitely)? 

* We want our nuts drained by an attractive lady. 
* Peace of mind/tranquility.
* Clean house, good food.

What are things that are universally desired by women that men have to offer?

* Emotional connection/feeling loved.
* Emotional Security (Their 'Rock')/Physical Security
* Leadership/guidance

Obviously this is very simple and generic and I'm sure your imagination can come up with more bullet points for both genders. I'm trying not to overcomplicate this to make the following point: 

You can buy the girlfriend experience for 80%. A good escort and a good housemaid is all you need to satisfy the majority of your needs. It's not that costly, especially when you factor in time saved by not having to go on dates, doing your own laundry etc.

On the other hand, the boyfriend experience can be bought for only 10% at most. Think about it, let it sink in for a couple days.

&#x200B;

Gentlemen, we are rapidly headed towards a society where most women **must** work full-time to sustain themselves. Where a minority of women will be married (and taken care of) not because they don't want to but because there are not enough high quality men around and women have 'standards' these days. Plus the fact that many men are starting to opt out of marriage because 'the juice is no longer worth the squeeze'.

It's up to women to 'give' sex - or not. It's up to you to give your commitment - or not.",1637609951.0
271,Today's Woman is Today's Prostitute,265,qyyf5x,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qyyf5x/todays_woman_is_todays_prostitute/,72,"**Every now and again I thought it was fun to text** [**Jennifer**](https://killtoparty.com/2020/03/10/adventureland/)**.** We had the most antagonistic relationship I had ever experienced with a woman. I would get a little high off of our interactions- especially if I were on the winning end of them. If I were to hit her with a quip that I knew rattled her. You could tell, even over text- she was emotive. It never resulted in actually fucking her again- which would have, admittedly, been a welcome consequence- but even little spats of nasty texting in between sets at the gym was entertaining enough.

Then, one day, the interaction was a little different. She said if I *did* want to see her- want to *fuck* her; want to do *whatever I wanted* with her for a night- it would be $500. At the time, I thought this was a jab at me- and, frankly, I took it as a good shot. After all, I was the one initiating these brief textual occurrences. So maybe I deserved to be treated like a thirsty doofus. I laughed. *Good one*.

I didn't give it another thought until after the very last interaction I had with a woman from Bumble- this dating app facilitated interaction was so repugnant; so shockingly negative, that it had me swear off dating apps- at least for now. 

**I was talking to a rather normal looking woman of about forty-years-old.** Our conversation was fairly normal. I enjoy *setting frame* as the typical dominant jerk that I really am, in my better moments. Women like it if you can mix dominant with being smart and fun- that's really the only *game advice* I can offer you, and I stand behind it. I had her call me Daddy- another mutual interest I have with the women I interact with. She took the sexy selfies I wanted her to. I assumed this would go in a direction of meeting at a bar, or at the beach, and hooking up- as these such things usually turn out.

The next day, I get a text from her. She tells me she's going shopping and would need a little pocket money. Please Daddy, she says. She attaches a canned picture. I tell her absolutely not.

Later, she texts again. She's embarrassed. She misunderstood. She still likes me. She'd still like to talk. She'd still like to meet and be considered for a relationship. Of course, for me, this was immediately removed as a possibility the moment she asked for money- as if she turned both keys on a nuclear missile attack. I do not tell her this- as now I'm interested in wtf's going on from the perspective of a writer.

**She tells me that she misunderstood my desire to be called Daddy.** This, to her, was a tell that I wanted to be a ""sugar daddy""- that she had other such arrangements with other men that she met along the way on dating apps. This entirely average looking 40-year-old woman had men, whom she claims to never have met- whom she claims to have never taken money for sex from- sending her Venmo and CashApp ""tributes"" for her pictures and erotic stories of sex with other men, men who were at least a decade her junior. 

I wanted to know more, but she cut our interaction short- she was ashamed; I had began treating her more like a curiosity than a sympathetic case of misunderstanding met with respect for a small business-like work ethic. She wanted to paint all of this as *normal;* what *everyone would do* if given the opportunity to make a little easy money.

Now, with the benefit on hindsight, I don't think [Jennifer](https://killtoparty.com/2021/01/30/jennifer-lost-the-war/) was kidding. I do think Jennifer would have taken my money for sex. I do think it's possible that Jennifer was in a similar situation as the average looking forty-year-old. **I do think that men on these dating apps- sapped of confidence; desperate for anything- offer women money for pictures and chat.** I do think we live in a culture where women think it's a good thing to accept these *donations,* or *tributes*, or... any terminology that makes it seem like they're not prostitutes. That they're strong ""girlbosses,"" with ""badass side-hustles.""

Like seeing a few ants on your kitchen floor and knowing there are 20,000 just behind the wall... there are more prostitutes than you think. You're probably talking to one right now- even if you're the guy she's selling stories about.

I don't think the original author will mind, but the original essay came rocketing into my brain after having seen a FortWorthPlayboy tweet about a friend of his, which I will copy below:

>Girls don't negotiate Slutty history with new Men in their lives.  She'll naturally hide it from a HV Man she has set her sites on. I just witnessed a local slut move 5 states away to make a fresh start with a guy who's NONE the wiser. **Both are incredibly happy.**

I spent a few minutes thinking about that final line- as I lie, alone in my bed, with my cat and an aching groin (after hernia surgery several weeks prior). I enjoy my solitude; I like to be alone, but I can't help but wonder- likely due to inexcisable biological impulse- what it would be like to *share a life* with someone. Not just in the temporary, like starting a new season of a long running TV series, but... in the permanent.

# I often wonder: is it possible to be happily married?

**To write my** [**book**](https://www.amazon.com/Welcome-Hell-Bad-Billy-Pratt/dp/195189751X)**, I wanted to get to know women.** I met different women; normal women. Once you get them talking, you realize that even the most normal of woman would have been considered a prostitute by a now obsolete social standard-at least at some point in their lives.

It would usually take a little cajoling to get these women to open up about their experiences. If you left it alone, you'd believe that they spend their weekend nights sitting on their hands, watching HULU and waiting for some nice boy to sweep them off their feet. 

If you're reading this, right now, you'll know that isn't the case. I've known this for a long time... What I didn't know, until I was there, talking to these women, was that **younger men use older women as a type of gas station bathroom of sex**. A gas station bathroom, because, you sometimes need to use one- you never spend a lot of time there; literally just *in and out*- and you're mostly disgusted after. 

Upon making this realization, I titled the corresponding essay [**Eternal September**](https://killtoparty.com/2020/09/19/eternal-september/)\- because, once a woman begins going those these motions, there is likely no escape; I titled by book **Welcome to Hell** for obvious reasons:

>A woman new on the scene will be enamored by the attention- so many options, often exceeding her wildest fantasies. A gym-rat in his early-thirties, looking to relieve a bit of stress after leaving the office; the twenty-four year old bartender; the frat guy cheating on his teenage girlfriend; everyone vapid and interchangeable, everyone with gaudy AOL screen names- all chasing a woman over forty. She always knew she could do better than her husband- and with the maturity of age, now she’s comfortable enough with her sexuality to indulge without regret.

**Maybe men are meant to be naïve.** Maybe any deviation from naivete can be understood as a demonic possession; the death of a man's soul; a vampiric infection rendering him the walking dead. A disease for which there is no cure, but I ask you this: **can a man know the true nature of female sexuality and still be** ***incredibly happy*** **saddled with a female permanently?**",1637426916.0
273,The Masculine Male (pook excerpt.),148,qx97oh,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qx97oh/the_masculine_male_pook_excerpt/,31,"There has been far too many noobers around these parts, noobers who can't read the sidebar.  noobers who're actually really fking ugly incels.  the truth is that all is not lost, even if you're alot worse than a ""good looking loser"".  however this applies to all men who lack sexual success. if you won't read the sidebar then i welcome you to a much easier alternative, the book of pook.  its ok to be noober, no1 overnight success.  even boomers have secks, every1 should have the secks.  enjoy the excerpt

Pook walks toward a bubbly Nice Guy with a needle of Man-ness.

“No! The prick will hurt me!”

Fine, die a painful long death of Regret, Loneliness, and Frustration. Any other takers?

Another Nice Guy volunteered.

See? This fella knows that a momentary pain is preferable to consistent suffering.

Pook puts the shot into the Nice Guy and injects him with testosterone.

Now, gentlemen, watch the effects.

The Nice Guy no longer fears what he desires. He sees the woman he wants. He approaches her.

Why do jerks approach women? To marry them? No! The jerk is operating not out of control with ‘that head down there’ but rather being influenced properly by his testosterone. He sees what he wants and goes and gets it. He does not apologize for it. He does not try to rationalize it. He does not analyze it. There are no stupid philosophies running around in the jerk’s head.

The Nice Guy gets rejected by the woman!

Oh oh! Poor Nice Guy! But look, something is changing. Look at the anger building up in him. Something is being charged within him. It is frustration. It is anger. The worst thing for him to do would be to cry and duck his head in the sand. Constant rejection requires one of two solutions: either lower your standards or increase your standards in yourself.

But it is true that standards do not enter the jerk’s mind. He gets frustrated and angry. He tries again with MUCH LESS awkwardness. Nature’s system is at work here, chiseling his social exterior. He gets the dates.

The Nice Guy gets dumped after a few dates.

Oh dear! What happened!? Why, perhaps the Nice Guy was trying to mock earlier jerk behavior and remetamorphed into an AFC eventually before his chick! Imitation IS suicide. No wonder chicks are so hard for honesty!

Do jerks really care on pleasing the women in the spirit of altruism and glorious relationship?

“Yes.”

Hush you! The jerks obviously DO NOT care about the women in such a manner. Their testosterone says, “I have needs that need to be fulfilled. Entertain me.” And so the jerks come off self-centered not because they ARE self-centered, but because they are closer to their own male nature and seek to satisfy their thirst.

The nice guy sees that fun is merely being around a beautiful woman. The jerk is a bit more… active. He wants to have fun his way. She is along for the ride.

It has been well known that action dates (ex: dancing, bowling, rock climbing, etc.) work MUCH BETTER than regular dates (coffee, dinner, movie, etc). Rather than merely matching the effect (the action date), let us focus on the cause.

The jerk would obviously skateboard and play basketball than to sit at dinner and watch the girl flap her gums. Testosterone has been shown to create more ACTION in the individual. Jerks (i.e. testosteronized males) do the action NATURALLY. Rather than worrying about making yourself do action dates, get yourself in that natureset and action dates will become the only comfortable choice you could make.

The Nice Guy gets dumped because he hardly made any moves.

Oh no! We know how the girl gets mistreated and will talk to her girly friend (the nice guy) about it. We see the abuse and we think, “Oh heavens! Am I to be abusive to get the girl?” What is this abuse? Is she really hurt? Or is she merely mad that she has failed in her mission: to sterilize and link to the masculinized dude?

“But the guy stands her up all the time, etc. etc.”

It is not because he stands her up. It is because she knows she is not loved by him. Her feminine powers are not ensnaring him. It is a feminine failure.

The girl sleeps with the jerk and he leaves her. We, as guys, think the abuse is the jerk sleeping with the girl merely to ‘use’ her (and motherly harpies try to feminize us into not doing ‘this’). Rather, the ‘abuse’ is that the girl realizes she could not keep the guy. She ‘was not woman enough’.


tl;dr if you can't comprehend what was said, you cant even begin to approach women.  once you know how to communicate, screen for receptiveness and talk to those girls.  complete this short book and feel free to test new things you've learned on women without full intent to fuck to properly digest ""how women communicate"".  When its time to land a bang you'll be far more prepared and not miss the opportunity. I've read 30+ books in the manosphere, this is a good one for forum noobers who don't want to read quite yet.  Theres nothing worth reading here daily that you can't find written in better format.  Guys of various experience posting here have no idea the level of mental weakness some of you guys are working with.  pook really has an amazing way of writing.  imagine if gaylubeoil wasn't a complete piece of shit every post making it as hard to decipher as possible.  pook is a cryptic in a beneficial way

You are sick and you know it.   
 

You, the reader, not even close to being a real man, are wandering on the internet to find that unique trick to solve all the problems surrounding you. Well, I am afraid that this post is not for you.  
 There is no substitute to reading the sidebar and lifting along with other habits like meditating, eating clean, socializing as much as you can, etc.   
 This post is for those who already have figure out the importance of the above-mentioned things and are religiously living a disciplined lifestyle.   
 

Here are **Some Don’ts** for all men to make themselves good men, in the eyes of other and most importantly in their own eyes.  
 

\[Note: This post is based on my personal experiences as I continue the journey to better myself every day. These are not advanced level tips as I don’t consider myself very experienced. Take it with a grain of salt.\]  
 

 

Don’t Boast –   
Or don’t brag. It is very beneficial to keep your achievements to yourself, as a result, you build your confidence to the point where you feel you don’t need external validation or people always praising you. Basically, STFU about your accomplishments until someone explicitly asks you about them.  
 

Don’t Blame –   
Or don’t accuse. The more you keep playing the victim card by calling other factors/people responsible for your current state, the more you fall in the rabbit hole of complaining and never making a move to uplift yourself. Sometimes, you are affected by external beings, but you need to treat such moments as mere obstacles. Be resilient.  
 

Don’t Betray –   
It is amoral to reveal others’ secrets. It is better to keep mouth closed if someone has asked you to do so. This way, you are not weak of a man to handle your urge to pour all your homies’ secrets. Be worthy of being a trustable friend.

Don’t Belittle –   
Or don’t put down people. Or don’t abase people. Rather make yourself seem inferior and let other men slip out their valuable info. Also, it is not good to trash the person you are talking in their face. Be careful in social situations, have some tolerance but don’t tolerate too much, leave the setting if things start to ignite inside you. It is better for both parties if you don’t contact them after you find you are better than them instead of just showing who the boss is every time you meet that person.  
 

Don’t Bust –   
Don’t bust a nut. Also, don’t fight, win with actions, not with physical force or verbal battles. You need to win the war not the battle, so take time and do your thing and the result will make you superior. Don’t fight with other men in a social setting, it will lower your reputation and get you in further troubles. Ignoring the one who irritates you will make him/her seem insignificant and thus putting you in a better defensive position. Never fight even though you are learning Muay Thai and BJJ. Remember, we are peacekeepers, we are not fighters. (Just like how Master Rossi said Goku when first teaching Martial arts.) The more you are calm and composed, the more you are likely to win. *“Strongest men are usually the most disciplined men.”*  
   
Don’t Babble –   
Don’t speak nonsense, no one has time to listen to that. Your brevity will be admired. Being laconic is an art.  
 

Don’t Bash –   
Don’t destroy the serenity, the peace. You will be much more powerful if you can deescalate and end predicaments than escalating and leaving yourself with a potential threat/enemy the next morning.  
 

If any of you bastards has read 48 laws of power, you would know this already. Read and reread the sidebar and DO! the things said there. I was only able to make this post because it hit me in my head as I encounter new challenges daily while I consistently follow the above-mentioned advice.   
 

It’s a refresher kind of a post.

275,"I don’t remember her name, but I know that she had herpes",66,qvbs2l,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qvbs2l/i_dont_remember_her_name_but_i_know_that_she_had/,58,"**You have this moment when you meet a woman with herpes where you think you’ve really lucked out.** Before the big reveal, of course. Where you think you’ve found this down to Earth girl who could just shoot the shit with you- no games. Where you feel comfortable *being yourself* yet still feel as though you’re respected as a man. Who has the same sexual proclivities as you; who seemed to enjoy being humiliated- a shame fetish, I suspected. You think to yourself, *could this be what it means to find a soulmate*? Could this have been my “one and only someone”?

No, stupid, she just has herpes- and much like the burning and irritation it causes her genitals, such is the guilt she feels when she meets someone new.

So, she tells you. She confides in you. You’ve already built a rapport. She’s shown you that she’s *different*. She’s cool. No pretensions. She thinks it’s interesting that you’d get turned on by watching her cry- this is new ground for her. Yes, you could verbally demean her. She’s hated herself for so long that it’s become a part of her sexual identity. **She tells you about her herpes because she thinks she’s built up some kind of equity with you.**

She tells you that you probably already have it- “most people have it,” if you didn’t know. And if you (somehow) don’t already have it, you definitely won’t get it from her- she “hardly ever has an outbreak,” and when she does it’s “barely noticeable.”

She tells you these things because she can’t bear to lie anymore. The countless men she’s spread her leprosy to through silence and omission haunt her dreams. So she’s cultivated the *perfect girlfriend* personality type. Had she only done so before infection, maybe she’d be married with children, but she won the unlucky lottery and here we are.

**The perfect girlfriend. Everything you’ve ever wanted in a woman, with one little defect,** but how about it? You had your mom buy you that pair of Air Jordan’s in 1992 with the tiny red dot on them, that you hoped your sixth grade class would never notice, and that worked out okay, so isn’t this the same?

Sorry. Fuck no.

276,Take note gentlemen,0,qw86e9,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qw86e9/take_note_gentlemen/,6,"I love the smell of dirty panties.

Each zone of scent.

Panties can smell a little different depending on what she eats, how long she wears the same pair, if she gets a little pee on them, at what point she is in her cycle, and so on. There are also zones of scent in dirty panties that have different kinds of smell (obviously).

Zone 1 - the Front seam of the crotch/gusset. This is where her clit and front folds of vulva are. When it smells really good, there is usually a yellowish/whitish bit of delicious dirtiness there. It has a high, sharp note. Flowery and sweet. Sometimes it can have hints of white pepper. I think the peppery scent is present when certain food or drink is consumed. Generally the smell is up high ""in your head"". I love this zone the most, but all of them are exquisite.

Zone 2 - The Middle of the crotch/gusset. This is where the Vestibule (opening to the vagina) is. This is where any discharge (which is of course, normal) and general moisture is. This zone is where you will smell a more mellow and wet sweetness. It's not as sweet as Zone 1, but still has a very delicious smell.

Zone 3 - The Back seam of the crotch/gusset. This is for the more refined panty sniffer. Obviously, the wearer's asshole has been in this area. Now, you might think to yourself, ""UGH, I bet it smells like shit!"" Well, ....yes I guess it could. But, more likely, it doesn't. As I understand it, the genitoanal region of humans have an Apocrine gland. It is mainly thought that this was used in evolutionary times as a way to signal for finding a mate. It has a deep musky smell. Still very sweet, but with low notes. You can feel it deep in your chest as well as up high in your head. It can have hints of vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar.

Obviously every woman will smell a little different, but in my experience, these basic things are pretty consistent.",1637180855.0

278,Simply checking boxes isn't what makes a man.,188,qr0wnq,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qr0wnq/simply_checking_boxes_isnt_what_makes_a_man/,53,"I thought of a dozen ways to write this, but in the end it was a waste of time, so I will keep this short and sweet. 

My point: Simply checking boxes off a laundry list of real life xbox achievements doesn't make you a man. 

* Oh you lift huh? Cool, I do to, so does that programmer nerd who is overhearing this. So what?
* You cold approached 10 girls today, this week, this month, whatever. So what? What difference does it make if  you have cold approached so many women that its starting to make you nauseous. 
* You have worked on your game, studied the art, practiced, failed, and repeated. So what? The chad next door has never ""practiced"" game in his life, so what?

The list of these achievements that we (yes we) have game-ified has gotten so long, its starting to look like an apple watch presentation about the million different ways you can display your heart rate on a screen so small its not even worth using.

What am I getting at? You know what I am getting at. What makes a man isn't what he does, or even what he did, or what he will do. Its how he will learn from it.

Working out, lifting, is not about gains, its about discipline. Gains are physical, and you will one day be 85 years old and shriveled up worse than a grape. You think Arnold looks good today? He looked good when his skin young, now he just looks like an overbuilt junkyard clunker that had more money sunk in to it that its worth. 

Working on your game, approaching women, etc, isn't about getting a body count, having sex every day, or having bragging rights that you can also be Chad. Approaching women has been engrained in our heads as something ""scary"" and if you can over come fear, anxiety, depression, laziness, etc, you can apply that everywhere. Approach a million women for all I care, if all you did was numb your sense to the point that you are a walking talking robot, why the fuck should I care? You aren't cold approaching to make the process autonomous. You are doing it to learn how to overcome your weaknesses and if possible, remove them from your life entirely.

Recently I quit my job. I was making 6 figures, a healthy amount, but I was honestly just over it. I doubt I could easily find a job that paid me this much. What's the catch? The VP himself called me into his office and asked why I was leaving. I cold turkey told him ""I'm just burned out."" He offered me a 1.5x salary raise and the choice of where I want to move since we are a global company. I told him ""Sir, I don't want to have to be dependent on you to tell me where to move, even if you make it seem like my choice."" The difference between him and me is nearly 20 years. This guy is known to be ruthless, he has fired a fair share of my collogues who just didn't cut it. There were no second chances, and if he wanted to fire me that same day to avoid paying me benefits and severance packages, etc, he could. 

Most people in my position would have jumped on the opportunity, but what does life teach us about too good to be true opportunities? Yes, that they are in fact too good to be true. I knew I was getting used, even though the pay was great. Sometimes just saying no I won't put up with it is hard.

Back to the point. These check boxes that all you kids are trying to check off as if you are playing call of duty won't get you anywhere. You think that my colleagues didn't have the same exact degree as me? They did. Yet they didn't cut it.

Try doing this. Write down your ultimate red pill list, go grab a piece of paper (not your phone you millennial fuck) and a pen (no erasers here bitch) and write down with out googling what your ultimate red pill achievement list is. Dig into your subconscious.

Now replace it with this:

* Mental discipline
* Resistance to physical pain
* Stress management
* Fight instead of flight
* Learn to dig yourself out of depression
* Ignore anxiety
* Patience
* Think big and long term about your future
* You can have the pussy only after you are done working
* Learn to say no, enough is enough
* Stop being a simpleton
* Consider everything an investment of either time or money

My list looks a whole lot different right? There is probably a million other things that I didn't put on it this time, but I will leave you with a quote from an article I read a while back from the early 2000's that still stuck with me.

**Summary**

Every girl wants to one day find a real man, but no girl wants to know what it takes to become one. The process is awkward, not socially accepted, a continuous struggle between a desire to spin plates and a repulsion to witness your own personality at its weakest. To be cringy, to stutter, tremble, blush and sweat. There is no other way than to burn through a 1000 women. Many you will make uncomfortable. To want it to be no different than it is, to become unashamed, that is to see the piles of plates piled up on the street, waiting for someone to pick ‘em up and give ‘em a little spin.

&#x200B;

**Body**

1 - Danger in imminent. Danger is everywhere. If you’re an average looking woman spending your days in the buzz of busy streets, hasty strangers and roaring cars, danger is always there. If you’re an average looking woman walking alone at night, danger is on your mind, always. If you ever hope to one day have the balls to stop any stranger in the street, you have to learn to deal with the fact that danger from the unknown is somewhere in the back of any girl’s mind, and you may very well be the danger her unconscious mind is very much looking to avoid. Do not want it to be different.

&#x200B;

2 - Sad people have two things in common: they are ignorant and they hope. Know and do not hope. The only metric that has any significance in your journey to power in the realm of women, is the amount of women you stop and talk to. Take a brief moment to count the girls you talked to in the past two days. Now take away cashiers, bartenders, colleagues and online dating. How many among you dare to admit you’re at zero? You’re ignorant and you’re hoping. Know and do not hope.

&#x200B;

3 - Cold Approach: A Voice of Society. I get it, it’s fucking scary. You’re on the street, shopping, whatever. Cute girls pass by you *en masse*, but what should you say? Think for a moment what it means to ask that question, and you quickly find you’re looking for a socially acceptable way to interrupt a woman from her state of being. So you ask for a coffee place, where the nearest Zara is, or where you can buy a goddamn chess board in this street. I don’t give a fuck what it is you have to ask - you stop and talk to women, you stop filtering yourself. That is what you do, that is who you are. And to those mocking such a man to be a slave of his desires I say, that mocking voice in your head is your worst enemy, protecting you from the resistance you need to build an actual personality. Forgive the girl in front of you for her unexpressive face. She is yet unaware she'd love to suck your dick tomorrow.

&#x200B;

4 - “But what should I say?” That question will burn through your mind for ages. You think about it some time longer and you discover that looking for a socially acceptable thing to ask or say implies that saying the one true thing on your mind is forbidden, wrong. Gad, that you saw her and now that you’re standing here you actually have no idea what to say. That you know this isn’t normal but you thought fuck it. That you know you’re nervous but also excited and if she maybe wants to talk for 60 seconds to a random stranger. That you’re bored of the ordinary but terrified to talk to anyone like her on the street. That she’s cute, hot, she looks interesting, intriguing, you love her thick black hair, her basic bitch unamused face, her mature sensual confident energy. That she should skip her plans, she should stop calling and come talk to you. That she should give you her number. That she should cook you dinner tonight. That you’re looking forward to it.

&#x200B;

5 - Burn through a 1000 girls. A 1000 girls - at least! - just to say hi or goodmorning. You won’t get their number, you won’t get in their pants. They are your target practice. You will creep some of them out, a lot more will simply ignore you. Then another 1000 to ask cold random questions to, until it bores you. Many will be awkward, many more will simply ignore you. Every girl wants to one day find a real man, but no girl wants to know what it takes to become one. If this is what it takes for you, then this is what it takes.

&#x200B;

6 - You’re terrified of disturbing her - or even worse, them. Greet every woman, man, old, fat, foreign you find on the street, the bus or at work. I say it’ll take you an extra 1000 people to figure out how ready and willing everyone actually is to be disturbed. And many will ignore you still. But they will all make you smile.

&#x200B;

7 - Burn through women. There is no magical thing to say. It’s all about the strength of your personality and your personality is weaker than you think. But burn, burn, burn and on the other side walks a man who can turn around in the middle of a busy street and run after any girl he just caught in the corner of his eye. Here is a man not afraid to be afraid. Here is a man laughing with his own insecurities, his own trembling voice. And to every assumption he makes to not go back and talk to her, he says, “let’s find out”.

&#x200B;

8 - Unashamed. The highest stage of seduction. Here is a man who is unashamed of shame itself. And for all the witnesses of his most shameful rejections, you have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. Here moves a man without chains, without resentment for himself. Here moves a man with a voice in his mind stronger than the voice of society. Here’s a man that is a threat, an imminent danger, because she knows her boyfriend won’t like it. But God, is she looking forward to get railed by this stranger.",1636546923.0

What he meant was, to become so attractive, fit and well put together that you don't have to chase women anymore, instead they chase you. This method would work, and I believe on the phases of my life where I did in fact look decent, I did get some attention. Well, the one who told me that, he's a tall fit chiseled jaw looking handsome ass motherfucker who has a hairline that celebrities would envy. Of course, he'd get chased. For me to 'be the chase' would require 20 plastic surgeries, a hair transplant, two personal trainers and a personal fashion stylist - and in a decade maybe I'd have the frankenstein look that would garner enough attention that I could perhaps MAYBE leverage to intimacy.

I think that's fucking flawed if you're ugly like me. (no this isn't meant to be some cutesy 'oOoH I hAvE pOor SelF eStEeM' shit, I know what I look like and I'm working on it)

The real point here is, one that all the fucking weeaboo gamer nerds figured out.   
Minimise your weaknesses, maximise your strengths. (or min/maxing)  


I know I'm not super fucking handsome tall perfect chiseled jawline greek god material. I minimise the weakness by exercising enough to get some decent muscle mass, wear well fitting clothes - I'm not an absolute slob, my foot jammed in the door so I can let my strengths play out. My strengths are definitely my irl humor/charisma/conversation - I actively hone this by going out and just having as many conversations as possible, trying different tactics to get different outcomes constantly making mental notes of what works, what doesn't - perfecting shit down to an art.

Reverse this if you are a good looking motherfucker.

My mentality summarised became: 'have fun, live life, we're all going to die anyway',   
We're all going to die anyway, so why do you fucking care so much what others think of you, why do you fear what someone might say. Wave a hello, slide in that dm, people are too self absorbed anyway. You are a mere speck in the floating continuum of social interactions, nobody really gives a shit. You and I we take a photo together and we look at the picture, you look at yourself first make sure you're looking okay looking fly. People are way too self concerned to care about you. Don't take shit too seriously.

We're all going to die anyway, so none of this would matter so fucking much - say that absurd shit you wanted to, paint your dick grey (non toxic ofcourse) put on some googly eyes above it and call it an elephant, have fun. You'll be genuinely surprised at how far you can take it.

Have fun, but establish your core beliefs. You want her to be your intimate sexual partner? Make it clear that you want it so - so she has the chance to politely decline you or play along. The odds of you starting out as a friend and making it to a lover are infinitely lower than if you had started out establishing yourself as someone who is the fucking MAN to her woman.",1636449231.0
281,Beware of female bosses,294,qot2nm,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qot2nm/beware_of_female_bosses/,88,"**Note**: The points highlighted in this essay in the upcoming paragraphs are my personal interpretation of observations and conclusions drawn from psychiatrist studies and experiments conducted by reputed individuals and/or institutions. They also contain my opinions that I don’t desire to force on anybody and will not be offended if anyone respectfully disagrees by providing a counter-argument with similar credible evidence from reliable and verifiable sources.

**About this essay:** This might appear like I am against women leading teams and organizations but that is untrue. I don’t believe that female bosses in particular are bad, incompetent or even malevolent by nature. The actual purpose of this post is to inform people, or at least open discussions, on the difference between male and female bosses. Men have been leading everything for a long time and now, only a few decades ago women have been in charge in some industries or some sections of some industries, so it is time we understand how they function and how they work. Men and women are different physically, chemically, and socially because they are treated differently because of their genders, have different biochemical composition, and want different things in life. These differences cumulate and exhibit in multiple ways when either of the sexes hold a position of authority. If you truly believe the narrative that a boss is a boss and gender doesn’t matter, you are believing what you want to be true. What we want is an impartial and capable leader and we just want to know them by their title. However, the reality is far from that and we know it. Believing otherwise will be naive. In this chapter, we will see in which ways female bosses are different from men and how it might affect the dynamics at the workplace. I have presented evidence through this chapter which are sociological experiments’ conclusions and various psychological studies conducted by different credible and impartial institutions. This chapter aims to give it's readers a deeper insight into how women function as leaders and how you should change your approach while functioning with them because they are clearly different from men in a multitude of ways. It is impossible to keep your personality and character out of your professional responsibilities, so might as well learn to integrate that and learn to live with it.

## What makes them different?

them=female bosses

Hormones, understanding of the world, skills, interests are a few of the many things that make women different from men. In this section, we will see those specific differences from professional angles and how they have an impact in the workplace and the subordinates of the said female boss.

### Motivation to succeed

Men, in the workplace, are motivated to complete their deadlines, finish the tasks assigned to them as fast as possible. It will help them ascend the dominance hierarchy in that organization, because they will be invariably valuable to the bottomline of the company. Women, on the other hand, are more focussed on getting along, obtaining the respect of their coworkers, and being empathetic. The motivations to succeed are different biologically. Men choose to succeed by getting respectable and secure jobs to get more mating options or rather, better mating options. Women choose to succeed to overcome social barriers that they believe are hurdles in their path of being treated as an equal. The infographic generated by Boston Research Group based on research conducted in 2012 says the same([source](https://motivationfactor.com/gender-infographic/)). This motivation to succeed and thirst for achievements can be proven by looking at the distribution of both genders in colleges.

Academically women are more motivated to get higher education and more degrees and men are more likely to get those degrees based on the practical utility it provides. Men choose their majors in college based on which might get them the most respectable job or the biggest check, therefore most men choose to go for STEM fields. Women, on the contrary, choose to go for degrees that they believe will attain them equal treatment. Most students studying liberal arts in college are women and most students in the STEM fields are men([source](https://www.stemwomen.co.uk/blog/2021/01/women-in-stem-percentages-of-women-in-stem-statistics)). The motivations to get a degree in a particular field and the motivation to get a job are different in both men and women and that directs the behaviors accordingly.

### People and things

Men are more interested in things and women are more interested in people([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19883140/)). As a result of this fundamental difference in opinions and interests, men are more likely to look at situations/incidents with a tactical perspective whereas women tend to take the social approach. Whenever there is a problem at work, which is almost everyday, men are more likely to look at it objectively and pursue the solution in that manner. Women, on the other hand, are more likely to look at things from the social POV. For example, who is involved in the problem, what can they do about it, who is affected, etc. Men are more likely to look for the answers to what is causing this issue, how it is affecting the bottom, etc.

If one is working under a female boss, it is more likely that you will be treated more as an independent individual but with male bosses, you will be treated more as a valued employee capable of solving problems.

### Materialism

This could have been included in the “motivation to succeed” but I feel it deserves it's own section. Men buy things that are necessary for their survival and women buy things for entirely different reasons([source](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/men-buy-women-shop-the-sexes-have-different-priorities-when-walking-down-the-aisles/)). Men already know what they are purchasing even before stepping into the store/mall and women browse when they get in, although they do have some idea about what they might want. If you read the article in the previous source, you will find that women do 83% of the purchasing. Although a part of it could be attributed to women who shop for their families, if you take a look at the possessions of a typical single modern woman living on her own in a big city who has a credit card, you will know. Younger women are more likely to purchase things online that they might not need but want([source](https://www.abacademies.org/articles/factors-affecting-female-consumers-online-buying-behavior-7296.html)).

How does this impact work? Well, what motivates women when they are acquiring things is what they “want” and not “need”. There are instances in which female team leads have done things based on what they want. Furthermore, this affects the decisions that a boss makes at work for the entire team and the office. Men purchase things or get things based on it's utility whereas women give some preference to the material value and the status the material brings with it. Men are okay to show up at work wearing a pair of shorts and a t-shirt but women need to go through multiple blog articles to nail the “chic” look at their office during the summers. Purchasing decisions, tools, workflows, etc, all of these are “materials” which are chosen for their utility only if the decision-makers are predominantly male.

### Stress response

Prefrontal cortex is a part of the mammalian brain located at the front of the frontal lobe and is responsible for a lot of crucial functions. Prefrontal cortex is responsible for a lot of complex actions, including but not limited to voluntary movement, planning, focussing, strategizing, and personality development([source](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/prefrontal-cortex#:~:text=The%20prefrontal%20cortex%20is%20a,greatly%20contributes%20to%20personality%20development.)). The limbic system, which is buried deep within the brain tissues of the brain has a completely different set of functions. It is responsible for behavioural and emotional reactions, especially the ones necessary for our survival. The limbic system exhibits and controls our response and behaviour for reproduction, caring for our young, feeding, and fight or flight scenarios([source](https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain/brain-anatomy/limbic-system)). Even though men have a larger sized brain in terms of volume(about 8 to 13 percent), women’s limbic system in the brain is more developed, resulting in the potential of experiencing a larger range of emotional spectrum more deeply than men with developed emotional response than men in general([source](https://www.iomcworld.org/open-access/brain-chemistry-and-sex-differences-are-male-and-female-brains-reallyvaried.pdf)).

Work is a stressful place where problems and challenges of varying magnitude pop-up on the regular. It has been found that in stressful situations like these, in the case of men, the prefrontal cortex activates influencing men to take a route involved in planning and strategizing and in the case of women, the limbic system activates influencing them to take an emotional and behavioural route([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3425245/)). Even though it cannot be said with certainty that any of the sexes are better at handling stress, because stress comes in different shapes and forms and demand appropriate responses and courses of the action from the individual experiencing it, it can be said that stressful situation at work can be more easily solved with the prefrontal cortex rather than an emotional response triggered by a powerful limbic system.

### Agreeableness

Agreeableness is a trait that comprises altruistic, empathetic, caring, and helping natures of the human species that makes the person more accepting, assistive, and forgiving towards others. If you are in the workplace and are in the position of power, you need to be authoritative, argumentative, and strong-minded. Although every emotion needs to be moderated in an appropriate range for ensuring success in the workplace, research has indicated that professional development is better in individuals that are less agreeable. People who are less agreeable are more likely to get promoted, more likely to earn more than the individuals who are more agreeable([source](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-18/agreeable-employees-earn-less-work-harder-good-for-companies/9670238)). This doesn’t mean that you should be a douchebag at work and be insufferable, it merely means that being the “good, helpful guy” probably won’t get you your next raise or promotion. Learning to say “no” at times and putting yourself(or the collective) first might help you as these are the traits most sought after in a leader.

Time and time again it has been shown that women are more agreeable than men and it makes them more empathetic, patient, caring, helpful, and altruistic([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149680/)). Furthermore, it can be observed that the professions that require those personality traits are predominantly done by women. Examples include but are not limited to, teachers, nurses, babysitters, air hostesses. Women who are bosses or women who are driven enough to climb up the professional ladder to become bosses have to cultivate this trait of disagreeableness. Going against your nature and compromising your own morality will make you resentful, hurtful, and vengeful([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3083636/)). The same concept has also been deeply described in “Crime and Punishment” by a great Russian. Are you comfortable with working with someone who is potentially like that? Again, not all women are by default agreeable, but a majority of them are, of course, hyper-successful women who are difficult to co-live with as a partner but a person who has compromised their own morality is harder to work for.

## How are male bosses different?

Note: The following points are derived from personal experiences hence could be treated as anecdotal evidence.

* Getting along: Men don’t need to get along to get shit done. In my personal experience, I have worked closely with men who deeply hate me and I despise them back. Even though we occasionally make out mutual hatred clear through serious sarcasm, I never had trouble working with them. Yes, it made things a bit difficult, but after a while, it was okay. I don’t recommend working with someone who you hate, although it will be okay to work with someone who you are not particularly fond of. You will always be on “defensive mode” because that person might sabotage your career, or worse, mental peace.
* Humor: Everyone does make some kind of jokes and the kind of jokes that I make are not particularly PC(at least I think they are “jokes”). In my personal experience so far, making those kinds of jokes will draw you trouble if you do it in front of women. And I am not just talking to coworkers, it is my sister, female acquaintances, etc. As a response to non-PC jokes, women like to put the guy in the spot by making a snide remark, taking personal offense, and often follow up with an inquiry asking what makes that joke funny. Some laugh it off, but it just kills the vibe.
* Predictability: Women are more emotional than men. A lot of studies already prove that, and even though it is just a fact, many take offense to it. It is an objective fact and it is the way women are in general. Anyway, I feel that men’s emotions are predictable and we know what’s up and how to behave, and reading the room becomes easier. In the case of dealing with a room full of females, or even a conversation with a woman at work, it is hard to gauge her emotions. At the end of the day, men have an “life sucks and we have to deal with it” attitude, but in the case of women, it depends how much attention Amy from accounting was getting because she had a haircut, just joking, but you get it(men will be like, “yeah I know, right”, but women will, well, I simply have no idea).

## Some stereotypical points

Of course, since I am a straight male living in the age of modern feminism, some of my opinions will be stereotypical towards women because all men are pigs and bigots. Instead of making it difficult to fish out from this long essay, I made another section, so go to town on this one.

* Fake compliments: It is evident from the social media these days, but women really do that in real life as well. I had never seen a woman talk badly to another woman to her face. However, I have also rarely seen a woman talk highly of another woman in her absence. Honestly, it is none of my business who women choose to hate or appreciate as long as this duality doesn’t exist. My female boss gives fake compliments to other women in common meetings but her opinion shifts entirely when they leave. I guess she was complimenting her personality and not her quality of work.
* Personality extrapolation: Women tend to form an impression of you based on a small interaction that you had. Men do it, but the impression keeps on modifying as the number of interactions increase. In the case of women, their demeanour in every new interaction will be defined by the way they understood you in the first one. Again, this is something that I feel personally and you might disagree with this.
* Being friendly: This takes up a lot of energy. I am not at work to make friends although that will be a welcomed outcome, if the opportunity arises. Friendships forge themselves and cannot be forced. I know being nice and kind is good, but being over the top “friendly” is irritating. I cannot bother to change the tone of my voice while greeting you every single day while you share a dull anecdote from your life that I do not care about. Some days are busy, I just want to complete my shift, go home and take a nap, it is nothing personal if you interpret me as “unfriendly”. I will always be nice, courteous, and professional, but dragging conversations filled with fake compliments to appear friendly is not my cup of tea.

## Friendly advice

Women are in the workplace and thank god for that. There are a lot of perks of women being in the workplace, although I will write about that in another essay. The point is either today, or tomorrow you might have to work with women. Here is some friendly advice that you can follow if they make sense to you.

* Be professional: Speak less, speak when necessary, speak when spoken to. It is a good piece of advice. Confucius also said something along the line of, “silence is a friend that never betrays”. One of the most important aspects of being professional is staying silent in most cases. Be courteous and nice but please shut the hell up, especially when you are around women. Everything you will say will be seen through their emotional filter. At work, everything you say should be work-related and nothing else. Answer the daily conversation starters in one sentence(not one word). “I had a great weekend” instead of “great”.
* Desexualize yourself: At my workplace, most men of my age wear t-shirts, hoodies, cargo-shorts, denim shirts, etc. I keep it simple, a full-sleeved shirt and a pair of trousers with shoes. I am not saying it because “I am a saint” but because your purpose is to get the bag. Present yourself professionally, clean and neat. Added perk is I don’t have to spend any time thinking about what I want to wear. If you are an attractive man, have a regular haircut, don’t wear clothes that show off your toned abs or muscles because your purpose is not to raise eyebrows at work. Believe me, it doesn’t help you in your professional journey. Yes, being presentable helps, but not like that. This brings me to my next point.
* Don't have sexual relationships: This is a “duh” but so many people do it. Having sex changes everything at work, but I might have to write another short post about how it changes the dynamics at work. I will also advise, don't even meet them outside of work, because you have no idea what kind of a human being they are. They could be amazing, unless you wish to increase the level of friendship, don't even meet them outside of work. Also, another branch of advice off of this train of thought, men are better friends, or in other words “female friend” is a myth. Like Ice Cube had said, “I don’t converse with pussy I ain’t gon get”. Anyway, the point is, your life is already complete, don’t meet women from work outside of work.

Comments are welcome. Please be respectful, provide logical arguments and above all, keep in mind that I am just an idiot with the internet.",1636305496.0

Gyms are shut for 3 days. What do you do when you 
1) Need to get a workout in
2) Want to get as much stimulus as weights would give your muscles
3) Need an actual challenge?

You don't train your body.
You train your mind.

Not just physically but mentally exhausting workouts.

I'm talking 1000 pushups
500 pullups 
An hour of jump rope
1000 bodyweight squats

Basically anaerobic marathons where your body can not take it. It's just you and your mind...which is where your brain becomes your enemy.

Be it anything- cold approaching, working out, cutting calories- your brain wants comfort. Familiarity. Sloth. Complacency.

This is where the idea of the self comes in. Who are you? Someone who'll do a hundred pushups and stop because 'buh....muh chezt is sore...muh tryceps...' or someone who'll keep pushing and stop when YOU'RE DONE and not when your brain tells you you're done?


Habit and identity formation-
Research into this topic shows that building a habit requires FORCE. You struggle to push yourself up a peak and then your habit becomes a part of your identity. You just BECOME the guy who cold approaches fearlessly. You just BECOME the guy who can handle social situations. Your brain has now succumbed to the desires of the self.

A good way to do this is the kind of workouts I mentioned. Experience it for yourself. 

All throughout the lockdown I regularly did 500 (weighted) pushups and workouts like those.

Did a 1000 pushups the first day gyms were closed for Diwali celebrations. The next day I did 800 squats. The next day I decided I'd do an hour of jump rope. (60 sets of 60 seconds each)

That morning, as you could imagine, my legs trembled.  I could barely walk. Halfway through I wanted to give up. Legs were fried. After mustering the willpower to push through, I noticed something weird. As I approached the 40th set, my soreness seemed to go away. My brain eventually knew 'this guy isn't going to stop....might as well stop sending 'soreness' signals'

Such are moments where the self will triumph over your comfort- seeking brain - only and ONLY after you've pushed the boulder up the peak. Smooth sailing from here on out because your brain now acts according to your idea of your self.

So you wanna build a habit that lasts? 
Acknowledge that your brain will work against you. Acknowledge that a true, concrete self takes time to form. Fight. Stay on the grind.",1636262826.0
283,Girl established rampant IOIs with boyfriend right next to her,58,qofbti,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qofbti/girl_established_rampant_iois_with_boyfriend/,54,"# Intro

I am 23 and in the last 3 months I started work to improve my SMV, frequenting a small bar nearby to practice socializing and build connections. I've noticed the change in people's behavior towards me (both good and bad) and I am still building my database of social queues, so this situation even in retrospect is uncharted territory for me.

# Report

I met this couple tonight at the bar and would estimate they are at least in their late 20s. Almost immediately after introductions the girl began pouring IOIs over me as I sat in front of the bar, to her right (only after she continuously insisted I did so), with her boyfriend on her left.

She gave off more signals than I can remember. Full facing body, dreamy eyes, leaning/moving close to me, frequent touching/feeling, especially of arms and shoulders. Sometimes subtle and sometimes not at all. Once during conversation I got the 'tingle' to look at my crotch and saw her hand quickly jerk back as I looked down. When I looked at her she was blushing wide-eyed.

Most notably later on, she ""accidentally"" bumped her ass into my side,and immediately apologized for it, though I'd not acknowledged she'd done it.

She interrupted and even straight up ignored her boyfriend to listen to what I was saying or monopolize my divided attention. I expected him to get pissed and lay down some discipline after the third or so time she cut him off but no. He just shut up and let her speak.

Through talking with her it was clear in subtext that she was home often and does not work at all, not even cooking. She does the shopping, he does everything else.

I do not remember a single moment that she initiated intimacy (they didnt kiss once, not even a peck) with her boyfriend of 6 years, but there were plenty of times he came and stood over to do just that. Of course with little reciprocation, if at all.

She also asked where I lived, the street and kind of house I lived in.

We spoke for maybe an hour but by the end of it I think he noticed what she was doing and eventually scooted her off the stool so they could leave. Her boyfriend made it too risky to ask for her number so I asked him for his instead, under the premise of wanting to send him some article I read a while back.

# Conclusion

I am seriously wondering what the fuck that was all about and where to proceed. Every question in reflection brings up more questions. Should I take those hints seriously or disregard them? Apparently she has a boyfriend of six years so why is she acting like that?

**Who was actually being tested here, me or the boyfriend?**

**11/22 Update**: 

Ran into the couple at the bar again, sitting at a table with friends. I sat next to the guy and did not acknowledge or pay any mind to her. I began talking with him and she did not make any attempt to interrupt or interject the conversation, contrary to last time. Him and I actually had a good conversation about knives, food, politics, life and other general BS. He invited me over for a meal ""one of these days"", but how genuine that was remains to be seen.

Only notable thing the girl did was wink at me as I excused myself to go to the bathroom, but I ignored it.

A few hours later the guy announces they are leaving. We say our goodbyes and he leaves but his girlfriend stays to talk to someone (I think it was a mutual male friend of theirs but I only glanced for a second). Ten minutes later he came back, called her name and raised his voice for not leaving with him and she caved in very quickly. I don't know how to explain it but I was relieved to see him put his foot down with her.

I followed the subs advice to ignore her and ignore her I did. And potentially made a new friend!",1636252608.0
284,Why do women NEED so much attention?,278,qnypx4,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qnypx4/why_do_women_need_so_much_attention/,108,"I’m 29 M. I’ve noticed that social media has flipped into something way different than I grew up believing it would become. When I have a moment of downtime I may open up IG. When I do I see my sports highlights and some folks doing some cool shit. BUT If I switch to the explore page it’s women literally of ALL ages  doing any and everything for what seems to be male attention. Dancing spinning  sideways so you can see their frame, very sexy clothing, great provocative pictures etc.  Don’t get me wrong I enjoy the views but it dawned on me. Why are they doing all this?? What’s the end goal?? To turn a man down if he shows interest? I have a rotation that I do my thing with so I never cold approach or online shoot my shot. I understand my ladies want attention in person I give them enough for my system but if I tunnel vision on work or maybe even the game I’ll notice them get closer, do a deep sigh lol and other gestures to notify me that they know I’m not thinkin of them in that moment. It seems that men looking or interacting with them holds a power or value I don’t understand. As a man I thrive off little to no attention so my perspective is 1 sided. I let whatever my mission is at the current moment bring the attention. Curious to here some theories on why women seem to consume & want  MORE and MORE attention these days . Especially the millennial women.

It’s kinda annoying and draining when I see what they do for clout on the gram.",1636199713.0

Posted a few times, but haven't bothered doing that in a long time. I've been busy and just don't really keep up anymore. I just don't feel like there's much else left for me here. We're never really done learning, but 99.99% of the content here doesn't add much for me anymore and I love giving advice and mentoring younger guys, but don't like filtering through the 90% who don't want to do the basics or have 10 million excuses.

Don't know where the inspiration to suddenly write something came but I've been feeling extra reflective and energetic lately and you guys are the ones I'd like to share my thoughts with and bring us all back to the real actionable basics of all this.

Almost 10 years ago when I first came into this PUA, RP, Manosphere, whatever stupid name you want to call it the only site I like was Good Looking Loser, because it was just action results, and dumb meat head shit. ACTION, RESULTS. So I like to follow the same scene and take our heads out of the clouds and get back to it

Get Your SHIT Together

*Sleep*

Health is fitness, sleep, diet, and all of that shit. Everyone here just says LIFT but it's really all of that. First thing is first. Get some SLEEP! I literally wrote a full post on it a while back on it. 8 hours a night, and even a one hour nap in the day ideally before 2. Matthew Walker PhD literally says it's the base of the pyramid for our health and I'd agree. 8 hours of sleep > 5 hours sleep + 1 hour workout.

*Diet*

Eat healthy. Green leafy vegetables, and colorful things that grow out of the ground and trees are better for you than oreos. There's enough out there on it so I won't beat a dead horse.

*Fitness*

Get thick and shredded. Surprise, girls like muscles, and abs. Frame, game, shame, and whatever can get you laid if you're fat, but it'll be easier when you look like a sexy slab of lean beef.

*Supplementation*

If you got the cash to blow you can get pretty thorough blood work from a longevity doctor or somewhere cheaper to identify any deficiency and then correct from there. TRT, Vitamin D, Vitamin K etc. I won't tell you what to take nor am I a doctor. Nootropics are cool too, but be a big boy and do your own research with all of this. I know someone will say something like ""eat a balanced diet and you'll be fine"" but if you got that year round tan like I do you're probably at least Vitamin D deficient.

Get Laid

Notice how I wrote Get Your Shit together first. Yeah, it's because it's easier to get laid if you have your shit together. Your anxiety when talking to girls (and in general) will be lower period if you have a healthy diet, sleep schedule, and veins that runs from your obliques, and lower abs down to your dick.

But enough about that. Getting laid is just the product of three things generally:

***Look Good***

*Fitness*

Already Covered, but be fit. 10-12% BF with some muscle mass, along with having defined facial features is a game changer. Seriously, google what peoples faces look like when they get shredded, and when they were chubbier. You literally get more handsome. It won't fix truly ugly, but you'll be better than before

*Grooming*

I'm not your mom, but I'll tell you this anyway. Spend more than 12$ on your hair cut. Groom your beard. Shave your head if you're in balding denial. Trim your nails. Wear deoderent. Shave your balls, trim your ass hair. Get your eyebrows done. There's more but you get it

*Fashion*

Talk to a gay dude, a trusted woman (if you have one), or find a blog. I'm not giving out tips on this.

***Talk to girls***

There's a lot to say here and I can't write a million paragraphs so I'll give some cliff notes.

If you live in a very small town, **MOVE** to a bigger city

If you stay home all day, **get a hobby** that has girls in it. Some bullshit running club, volleyball, charity work, or whatever that **HAS GIRLS.**

Happy hours, Night Clubs, Bars, or whatever your scene is if it's worth your time and effort. Don't drink much, it's a waste of money and calories.

If you're an engineering student, take one psychology class or something along those lines. It's loaded with hoes.

For you Math people, your expected number of hoes = n\*p where n is the number of girls you talk to times your probability of pulling a chick which is just a function of your game/looks. E\[H\] = np. Talking to more girls means you'll probably get more girls. That easy. Efficiency comes with practice.

***Logistics***

IMO this just isn't emphasized enough. I know some guys are super duper cool, and meet girls in clubs and bang them out right on the dance floor/rooftop/bathroom/alley/dumpster behind McDonalds, but most well adjusted girls like to have sex on beds with clean sheets.

Take girls to bars/locations close to where you live. Go to bars close to where you live. Keep your living area tidy. Have condoms on you and close to your bed.

There's nothing worse than missing a lay, because of shitty logistics. It's easier to say, let's grab a drink at my place, it's across the street, than it is to say, ""Let's take a 20 minute Uber to some location you don't know"". Enough said

Get Paid

Get paid comes last and this is purely an opinion here, but I truly believe getting laid and having your shit together helps you get paid more.

**Confidence**

First off, confidence aka balls, aka huevos are basically multiplied when you have had 8's and 9's eagerly sit on your face. This confidence is what leads you to taking bolder moves such as taking the job overseas, or negotiating that raise, or bringing up that idea to your boss.

I make more than smarter guys than me in the same field for this reason.

**Saved Time/Money**

No surprise from anyone here, but girls are expensive if you're not very good with them. Wasted time/money on dates, drinks and whatever. It's pretty great when Susie gets dropped off from her nice dinner/movie date with Brandon to your place, to have her guts rearranged. Brandon spent 3 hours and 120$ on steak and popcorn, and jerked off to the thought of Susie. Just one more date till a solid make out and second base. You spent 30 minutes a condom and two kleenexes.

**Invest**

Not going to give serious financial advice here, there's people way better than me to talk about that, but seriously, if you're not investing, you're wrong.

**Career/Entrepreneurship**

Not going to give career advice here, there are plenty of threads on it. Work hard, work smart, take risks, and if what you're doing isn't working, then you should be doing something different.

Conclusion

It feels like there's so much more to cover (traveling, learning, meditation) but I don't want to write a novel. I just want to talk the fundamentals. The stuff that matters. Theory is cool, but results are better.

It's been fun writing again. Hope you guys enjoyed, and that at least of one you guys got something out of it.",1636115465.0

287,Second Rejection--998 More To Go,54,qllj1u,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qllj1u/second_rejection998_more_to_go/,54,"*Some of you complained about the previous field report for whatever reason, but I don't worry about the ones who complain.  I post these for the ones who want to hear about a guy who posts advice on Reddit, but also posts about him doing the things he talks about.*

I went out to Walmart today and saw a cute 19-year old Walmart worker (I know because I asked her her age).  She was friendly and the interaction only lasted less than 5 minutes.

I was walking in Walmart checking the aisles.  I saw a cute Walmart worker who was stacking the shelves.  I was about to bitch out (gotta be honest with you guys), but I circled around the aisle and greeted her.  I asked her her age and asked her for her number (I said other stuff in between).  She told me she had a boyfriend and couldn't give me her number out of respect for her boyfriend.  I told her it was cool, have a nice day, and I walked away.

Even though I approached and got the rejection, I didn't like the way I approached.  I felt a little timidity in  my body (I bet she picked up on it) .   For those of you who don't like cold approaching, I suggest doing it to get out of your comfort zone.  Some of you use dating apps, social circle game, or just warm approaches (former acquaintances).  Like I've said before,  cold approaching is like taking a cold shower.  You just have to jump in or your mind will make you hesitate due to being uncomfortable.

Tips: I would say a good thing to focus on initially is seeing the girl and approaching almost immediately without even thinking about it.  This is what the PUA by the name of Mystery called ""The 3 Second Rule"" and Tariq Nasheed called ""Grenade Macking"", both meaning approach almost immediately before your brain makes you bitch out.  If you get rejected, you've had a success.  If you get the girl, you've had a success.  The success comes from taking action and building that confidence outside your comfort zone, the girl is a bonus.  So if you get rejected, be a good sport and tell the woman ""take care"", ""have a nice day"" etc.  Walk away with your head up, not with your head down like you failed and are disappointed.

Side Note: Be aware of your body and how you feel after the interaction.  When you're feeling timid or have zero confidence, it will come out in your voice and it will come out in your body language.  Be aware of this and use this exercise to get rid of it.

Are these field reports of getting rejected helping you guys out?",1635909436.0
288,#NoNothingNovember 2021 Tribe on TRP.RED - Drop 3 bad habits / vices for November and Track Your Progress,86,ql70vw,TheRedPill,https://www.trp.red/feed/t/NNN,14,,1635867756.0
289,"To all the whiners who say ""why do I need to learn this shit?""",131,qkkvzx,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qkkvzx/to_all_the_whiners_who_say_why_do_i_need_to_learn/,24,"Whenever there is a good article on game in this subreddit, there is always at least one or two guys in the comments saying something like “why do I need to learn all this shit just to get laid?” or “I didn’t know I needed a master’s degree to get pussy.” Other guys try to act like they can summarize game, relationships, and gender dynamics in pithy statements like “You don’t need to read this shit, just own your shit and be a fucking man, bro.” 

So why, exactly, do you need to learn this shit? 

You need to learn this shit because, over the past 80 years, the Western liberal media-entertainment-academic complex has successfully propagated a new ideology relating to relationships and gender dynamics that is completely wrong and damaging to both men and women. To inoculate yourself against this ideology you need to learn the truth. I call this destructive ideology “neo-Romantic” because its primary driving idea is that relationships and gender relationships should be guided by emotion over anything else. The neo-Romantic ideology includes principles like “men and women are exactly the same,” “men should supplicate to women to earn their favor,” “the value of a man comes from his ability to fuck hot girls,” “men and women do not need each other,” “casual, extra-marital sex is not psychologically damaging for women” and so forth.

This neo-Romantic ideology is rarely, if ever, articulated in complete form in any one place because it is internally contradictory and plainly absurd once you clearly lay it out. Instead, the neo-Romantic ideology is drilled into our heads subliminally in bits and pieces; some of it in rap videos, some in romantic comedies, some in gender studies departments, and so forth. The neo-Romantic ideology is not necessarily left-wing or feminist either; it is a mish mash of ideas from different ideologies and schools of thought and much of it is now just as accepted by the right wing as it is by the left wing. In fact, you can say that the neo-Romantic ideology has kept much of the worst parts of traditional conservative thinking and melded it with the worst parts of feminism.   

One of the worst lies of the neo-Romantic ideology is that men and women should not to try to rationally analyze and understand gender dynamics and relationships. The neo-Romantic ideology directly and subliminally teaches that “love,” “passion,” and “lust” are magical emotions that cannot be explained or understood; you either “feel” it or not. Most of the losers who say shit like “why do we need to learn this shit” have unknowingly accepted this idea. In their mind, romance is something that either “happens” or it doesn’t, and trying to rationally understand it and cause it to happen is a stupid waste of time. 

Another lie of the neo-Romantic ideology is that male sexuality is inherently creepy, predatory, and objectifying. Even though the neo-Romantic ideology says that a woman who wants to have sex with lots of guys is empowered and sex positive, it subliminally pushes men into monogamy and implies that a man that wants to fuck a lot of women has evil intentions. Even though this idea is plainly contradictory and absurd, most men in modern society, and even many Red Pillers have internalized this idea. These men feel ashamed of their desire to get laid, so, a wall of text explaining how to get women and succeed in relationships makes these men makes them feel icky. 

As a man, your sexuality and relationships with women is one of the most important aspects of your life. Why wouldn’t you want to do it right? Men spend a disproportionate part of their time trying to get laid and hanging out with women, and most of it is a waste because they have no idea what they are doing. 50% of marriages end in divorce, and most men end up screwing their purposes and mission because they are chasing women in the wrong way. Understanding this stuff is one of the most important things you can do.

290,Destroy Your Dick December,69,qkiq7e,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qkiq7e/destroy_your_dick_december/,79,"A lot has been written on the topic of No Nut November by the Red Pill and Manosphere as a whole. However, up until now no one has written on the topic of Destroy Your Dick December. Now I know what your thinking. You’re thinking, Gaylubeoil, You little jokester, Is this one of your silly troll posts? Ha ha! Is this one of your silly jokes? Common let's be serious. The Red Pill is about self improvement. Write about that please. So I can self improve.

And to that I say: Go Fuck Yourself. And I know you will. Because as soon as No Nut November ends your gonna march right into Destroy Your Dick December. In fact No Nut November logically signifies the existence of Destroy Your Dick December. They're like peanut butter and man jelly. Dudes aren't vowing to give up masterbation forever. No! They're saying they're gonna give it up for a month. And at the conclusion of that month their obviously gonna masterbate heavily and Destroy their Dick December.

So basically No Nut November is a giant foreplay month that the manosphere plays with itself and other men. It does this by denying the existence of Destroy Your Dick December, to maintain a veneer of respectability. But in reality if we're really honest with ourselves the whole point of the endeavor is Destroy Your Dick December.

At this point your thinking ha ha neat observation there Gaylubeoil. But what's the point of this? The point of this is that you and most of the manboys here are such degenerate ADHD sacks of shit, that the only way y'all can be taught a new concept is through elaborate masterbation and sodomy metaphores. That's all the dudes here know or understand.

Alright so now that I got you hooked with all of this hilarious pee pee poopie talk I can deliver my brilliant philosophical lesson, before you inevitably get distracted by an internet butt. All communication is comprised of Manifest and Latent content. Manifest is that which is said. Latent is not said, often denied but exists as a logical consequence of the first. Manifest content exists to hide traumatic latent content.

So for example, a while ago there was a post titled: Women Are Wolves In Sheep's Clothing. The latent content is that the author is a sheep. Because logically who else would care about wolves in sheep's clothing? Wolves don't care about wolves in sheep's clothing. They'd probably find the crossdressing wolf hilarious or disgusting. So the guy who wrote Women Are Wolves in Sheep's Clothing subconsciously thinks of himself as a Sheep-Man. That's why he wrote the post. He wanted to reassure himself of his masculinity because he felt like a sheep.

According to Freud's most famous book The Interpretation of Dreams, the purpose of every dream is to keep the sleeper asleep. Sounds simple right? Well in Freud's native German the word dream, can be translated as fantasy desire or wish. Dreams allow people to experience an uncomfortable reality, do nothing and continue the status quo like our Sheep-Man.

In other words uncertainty begets fiction. People hide from difficult Red Pill Truths via Blue Pill fiction. The Department of Defense commissions Hollywood to make war propaganda so that war can be normalized and continue indefinitely. Sheep-men write sheepish treatises to reassure other sheep men. Masturbators wax poetically about No Nut November while counting down the days to Destroy Your Dick December.

Truth can be used to create a lie. By getting you to focus on No Nut November you can be Distracted from Destroy Your Dick December. If you want to to play this Red Pill game you have to learn how to find the glitches in the Matrix. You need to learn to find latent content hidden within official narrative manifest content.

Or not. Be an NPC. Do what everyone else does. Listen to you teachers. Don't ask complicated questions. Don't point out contradictions. Hold out until December. Find yourself some nasty porno and Destroy That Dick.

291,"Your Dick Is A Gift To Women, Stop Devaluing Yourself",407,qjv3qh,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qjv3qh/your_dick_is_a_gift_to_women_stop_devaluing/,92," **Your Dick Is A Gift To Women, Stop Devaluing Yourself**

This is something that has been weighing on my heart as of the past year or so. It is also a realization that has forever cemented my sense of “inner game” and given me a certain level of both pride and peace not experienced prior. That is, that dick is a gift — Dick is not something to be freely given to women. It is a luxury item.

And, it is not something you simply give out when you are horny for your FWB, your wife, girlfriend, or casual random. Dick is a prized possession and valued resource, especially and more importantly good dick to be exact. But that is neither nor there and is not the focus of this piece. I only wish to provide factual information that will edify and uplift my brothers. 

To make a quick distinction, this is not about the virtues of having good dick. Good dick keeping girls around is obvious. What I am on about, is the virtues of not giving away your good dick for free. I want to start by breaking this up into several descriptive principles that detail the nature of our gift to women. Let us begin by listing out said principles, and then, a brief explanation of each:

***Principle 1: There Is Permanent Scarcity For Quality Dick***

***Principle 2: Men Are The Ones Who Make Sex Good, Not Women***

***Principle 3: A Woman Cannot Give Away Pussy, But Rather, Only Receive Dick***

***Principle 4: Good Pussy Is Most Often A Result Of Men’s Low Standards***

***Principle 5: Her Orgasm Is A Gift To Be Given, Not Something She Wills Into Existence***

***Principle 6: Dick Is To Be Rationed, Not Timely or Convenient*** 

&#x200B;

**Principle 1: There Is Permanent Scarcity For Quality Dick**

I’ve been with more than my fair share of women, and once you get them comfortable, provide them freedom from judgment, they will pretty much tell you whatever you want to know on day one, no later than day 2, trauma, skeletons, and all. That said, I always conduct pre-sex and post-sex interviews with women. I want to know how they want to take my dick and how, if at all, they want anything different. 

I do not do this for any sort of validation, but because I value a mutually fun experience (and avoiding cases by crazy women). You get more emotion, vulnerability, and control out of them this way. And of course, do you know what all of them tell me? They say that guys suck in bed. They say that men don’t give a shit about their pleasure. 

They say that when they try to tell a guy about what feels good to them, the guy throws a bitch-fit, gets defensive, and tries to waffle his way into talking her into “just letting the sex flow”. They say that if they’ve had an orgasm or cum, it was only by one or two of the 30 guys they were with. They say men try to fuck them with a “one size fits all” style.  

I could go on and on and I don’t want to drag this out. They say that the guy was awkward. They say that they never feel comfortable enough to say no or stop the guy mid-act if things aren’t going well. This is all to say that most women are sexually traumatized, either from what they call assault, to trash dick, to bad listeners. I also hear a lot that most guys are too afraid to indulge in whatever kinky act the woman wants. I found this strange, however, I discovered this to be tied in with the same idea of men being afraid of correction and “losing their dominance”.

If it did not come from his mind, it’s just a woman trying to control him. Now this is not me saying to only focus on women’s pleasure during sex. Truthfully, I don’t give a shit about their pleasure per se, only that they had a fun time. Caring about their pleasure too much leads to both dominance and sexual anxiety issues. What I am saying is that if you can do, or currently do, a few key things in the right way, then she will be, or is already, scared of losing your dick.

***That then begs the question, if a man can learn to be good at sex, then how could there be a permanent scarcity?*** One, most men aren’t getting pussy and will stay this way because they will never be lucky enough to stumble upon helpful material like game, pickup, or the redpill. Two, the ones that do get pussy either aren’t good at it, or aren’t fucking often enough to get good at it. Three, they don’t know the right questions to ask a woman and don’t have the skills to get her talking (game). Four, most men will always let their ego and pride rule them.  

To wrap this up, yes, women like to be told what to do. They like to be used for their bodies. However, in the grand scheme of what a woman needs to truly feel mentally dominated in a sexual capacity, and turn her into a crazy person that relies on your dick as her sole purpose in life, it isn’t enough. They need more. It’s not hard though. So if you can or do currently do this, you should not be fucking without some sort of payment from the woman for your gift. This is leverage and power. 

**Principle 2: Men Are The Ones Who Make Sex Good, Not Women**

This point especially has been on my mind for probably the last two years. After slaying girl after girl online, I’ve had a few who I would truly consider to be good pussy.  But even in obtaining good pussy, which we will define later, there came a point, rather multiple points, where I would burn out from it all. I came to dread my next hookup coming to my place because I didn’t have the mental energy to fuck them like I knew I could. I didn’t have any more cum to give. I couldn’t muster the mental energy to seduce, to learn her, to do foreplay, etc.

And what I came to discover after a long internal audit, was that I was giving away a valued service too often for free. It wasn’t due to a lack of break time. It also wasn’t just being tired or unfilled or them not being hot enough. It was because, although they would return twice to three times a week every week for the dick I was laying down, and would enthusiastically fuck me back, the work they put in could never really compare to the effort and value of mine. Being sexually dominant does take its toll on a man. Decision fatigue. Physical fatigue. Persona fatigue. 

Let’s break it down and really analyze it for a second. By virtue of being sexually dominant, you exert action. And by doing an action, you exert energy. And among energetic actions, deciding what to do next is a primary killer, absent being in a present mind state. Decision-making, not work, are what really burns people out from completing various goals, stopping them from winning in life. It is also what saps willpower. The tension of not knowing how to answer for the next moment. 

Next, we have the physical component. Out of all the sexual positions, all the variations, what do women really like the most? You ask any of them, it’s always doggy style, followed by standing variations. Then it’s some rough and aggressive version of missionary. After that, it’s anyone’s guess. I’ve never talked to a girl who said that riding dick was their one true calling. There are those who have a true talent, but in my observation, it’s few and far between.

I’ve had many a woman ride my dick for a prolonged period only for them to tap out from the exhaustion of their hips and I’m guessing their ass muscles. And I say to myself, “Nah, I know there’s more in you.” What does all of this mean? It means that you are doing the bulk of the work. Every stroke you take in missionary’s variations requires all of your body: ass, shoulders, quads, abs, triceps, etc. 

It’s a full-body workout. Doggy is pretty much the same, but easier. And no, I’m not calling sex difficult. I am merely explaining physical investment. If you gas out and your heart’s gonna explode from doing basic positions, you need to get your cardio up and/or see a doctor, seriously. But back to my point, I think this physical investment is partially why besides being multiorgasmic and lacking a refractory period, women are able to go so many rounds. Have them put in actual real work, and they go to sleep a hell of a lot quicker. 

All of this to say, most of the good sex that women claim to want, dominant and otherwise, is gonna involve a majority of the work done by you. Tell me how doggy style is gonna work without a man moving his hips? Sure, she can throw it back, but that’s not where a good pounding comes from. That is merely a highlight of a good thrashing. 

Tell me how missionary and side positions really work without the man? Tell me how her favorite roleplay or BDSM scene works without hard direction from you. Sex, good or mediocre, cannot work without the man as the captain. 

Let’s not forget that if a man's dick isn’t hard, nothing of value can happen, whereas a woman, if she needed to, can use lube. A woman can force herself to be wet, whereas a man, clouded in mindset, cannot even with a cockring or viagra. It can happen but is exceedingly difficult with screwy inner game. Men’s leadership skills, physical investment, and masculine aura, an act of action and not reception, are what make sex good. 

And finally, the magical inverse relationship of a man withholding his ejaculate until a certain time, and a woman trying to go towards her own. Good dick is a disciplined dick, and she cannot live without it. It’s funny how a woman getting anywhere sexually, or in life, really depends on a man’s self-control. Dominance in all aspects. Dominate yourself to dominate others.

**Principle 3: A Woman Cannot Give Away Pussy, But Rather, Only Receive Dick**

In game, we all know that a woman’s role is not to create or build, but to receive and multiply. Basics. Right. So then, we must apply this same logic to a woman’s sexual habits. If a woman is out hoeing on the streets, she cannot give away pussy. She can position herself to be penetrated, but she still has to receive it. She cannot give away what you think to be yours, what you never owned. For one, if dick is a gift, you therefore cannot own the pussy. If dick was transactional, making pussy transactional, then you might be able to claim entitlement to it like so many weak men do.

You cannot give a gift and still own the actions of the recipient. How then is it a gift? It’s like how beta male buy women gifts in hopes of secretly coercing them to stay and fuck them. Consequently you cannot hold a gift hostage. Then it is not a gift. It’s a manipulation tool. ***A gift is earned through an individual providing value or showing they have the potential for value. Gift giving is an inspired act.*** 

Two, good pussy comes from voluntary interactions with it where she wants to come out and play willingly. She knows she could fuck a bunch of other dudes but chooses to stay and fuck with you. Moreover, women receive dick. It may wear them out, but if you press them and they aren’t too sore from the thrashing you give them, they will almost always be able to take as much dick as you can throw at them. They are like bottomless pits when it comes to getting fucked. 

Dick on the other hand, is something that must be given. It then, by a woman, must be received (like a gift). Giving, again, is an action. It is something that you hand down. A woman taking dick is passive. It requires no effort, no real intention or forethought, or planning. Even if she starts out on top, she has to take not only your dick, but hard dick. And let’s say you for some reason stupidly decide to nut in this chick. 

Now she is pregnant with a kid she likely will always love more than you. And, broadly, generally speaking, will almost always be able to make money from through the government, friends, gofundme, and other internet campaigns. Absent the state, and the kid has a good dad, she is tied to that man for life. And what is a man? A man produces. He creates. He builds an empire. 

And all she has to do is play her role properly and profit. Giving a woman dick is giving her access to the potential of a lifetime of prosperity and peace. To give a woman dick is to give her a taste of the kingdom she never had. I look at any woman who has my dick as one experiencing a fucking come up. 

Dick is a woman's pathway to happiness. ***Dick is a gift because it requires her to take from you something of value.*** 

**Principle 4: Good Pussy Is Most Often A Result Of Men’s Low Standards**

I’m going to go out on a limb and speak on another topic that is near and dear to my heart. The good pussy you think you’ve been getting is likely because you have zero standards for the women you have sex with. Okay, she sucked your dick. Okay, she did everything you wanted to in bed: hit her, spit on her, pee on her, choke her til you left marks, etc. And okay, you came harder than you ever have in your entire life and you’re on a dominance high. 

That doesn’t mean you got good pussy. I will now attempt to define what good pussy truly is:

1. Good pussy is pussy that comes not from her being her horny, but from her seeking your validation and purpose within that. You will never get better pussy than a woman who needs the validation of your dick. And when I say I need it, I mean they would become depressed, suicidal, mentally ill, without it. It would ruin their week if they didn’t have it. 
2. Good pussy is that which comes from true sexual effort. It’s not just her being talented at what she does or being enthusiastic about it. It is her saying to herself, “I am prepared to be sore for the next week and a half to give him the very best of me.” It comes not only from seeking validation from you, but trying to impress you with her efforts. 
3. Good pussy, and this one involves you, is a result of being inspired, and not necessarily horny for a woman. What do I mean by this? I think we as men let our dicks lie to us too much. Have you ever asked yourself why you were horny? Most likely it’s because you either haven’t had your daily fix, you thought she looked good, you’re in scarcity, you want your ego boosted. It had absolutely nothing with her having to produce any real skills to get what she wanted. 

I am essentially saying here that you guys get hard too easily. You let her looking tight and right be enough for you. You let her teasing you be enough for you. You let her wearing a tight dress and high heels be enough. You let her merely cooperating with what you want be enough for you. It should not be. When was the last time you were horny not because she pulled out a bunch of “tricks” or “favors” to present to you, or because you were naturally horny, but because she went out of her own way to tap into the depths of her feminine essence and seduce you. 

Fuck your mind. I can tell you now, a woman that is both feminine and a truly skilled seducer, as in a seducer with intention is a rare, rare thing. And if you came across it, it would really screw your head up and you wouldn’t be able to function correctly. 

You’d probably become depressed and suicidal (at a lower beta level) because you were terrified at the thought of losing it. Why do I bring these points up? I bring these points up because they should be the bare minimum, the ideal, for a woman to have access to your dick. They are an offering

Good pussy is a woman doing things sexually for you that you didn’t ask for or expect. Not only this, but doing things that she has done for no other men. 

Good pussy is a woman that has a burning desire to be used by you

What does all of this mean in full context? Again, yes it is an offering to you but is much more than that. Good pussy is a woman acknowledging that the man is the head of the relationship/interaction/hookup and showing that with all of her being. A woman who recognizes this also recognizes that good dick is inherently more valuable than good pussy. Why is that? 

While good pussy is a powerful, powerful force to be reckoned with, good dick comes from the nature in which it arises. It comes from sacrifice, embarrassment, humiliation, trial and error, deep study, years of work, experimenting, an array of technical skills, a profound shift in identity, confidence based in identity and action, leadership, self-control and more. ***Good dick comes from pressure and reproach***. In other words, it comes from the profound journey that is masculinity. It is quantifiable.

Whereas, good pussy comes from that childlike carefree essence that is femininity. There is no force involved. It only requires them to tap into and submit to the deepest parts of that feminine essence and be willing to learn. On a final note, good pussy, if enacted in the way I describe above, really implies that if she is to put that much effort into fucking you, then she really can’t afford to fuck other men than you, or if she does, not often. It would take too much out of her.

I’ve had women I’m about to hook up with literally tell me that they can’t fuck me because they are too sore and emotionally drained from getting pounded by a dude she saw 6 days ago.  

**Principle 5: Her Orgasm Is A Gift To Be Given, Not Something She Wills Into Existence**

A common talking point I hear from women is that men get to cum all the time, and it’s not fair that women don’t get to. This is also a ridiculous talking point they use to guilt you when they don’t get their way. But if you don’t see why, I will break it down. Here is the basic difference. Women are always trying to find a way to cum, whereas, 97% of men are breaking their back and their mind’s focus, trying to use every mental trick in the book not to cum. Cumming for a man is almost involuntary, especially when you first start out. 

It takes a fair bit of skill for most men not to cum, in fact. But you all know this already. I’m not going to lecture you all on what we all fucking know. 

Let’s break it down further by discussing the power of a woman’s orgasm. Have you ever seen a woman orgasm, squirt, or cum in general? How their legs shake violently? How they make that stupid scrunched-up face like they’re both pissed off and about to be murdered? How afterwards, they often lay on the bed like they’re dead? How they can literally black out and even pass out after? How loud they yell when they’re being genuine? How you ever seen how pissed off a woman will get at you if they don’t cum?

I have. And let me tell you, when a woman doesn’t get to cum, she turns into a total psychobitch. Their orgasm and capacity for pleasure is leagues beyond what us men can muster without skill. They will literally cry after, yes, literally cry after, and dramatically sulk about how close they were to cumming. They will start arguments about how selfish you are for not giving them what they deserve. 

They’ll rush to another room, or hell, even stay in the room, pull out a lipstick vibrator, and go to town on themselves, finishing themselves off. They will in some extreme cases, try to forcefully grab your dick and get it back hard if needed, just to forcefully take it from you and try to cum. It doesn’t matter if you say no. They do not care. I’ve had this happen to me more than a few times. 

Now imagine what would happen if a man were to act like this in 2021 or any time within the past 30 years given our climate today. He would be accused of being emotionally abusive. He’d be accused of sexual assault or rape depending on the facts of the case. He’d be told that a woman’s body is not his and that he should respect her. He’d be told that his blue balls are fake and not her responsibility. He should just learn self control. They’d call him creepy. He’d probably lose his job. He might be killed by her brothers or some vigilante - no exaggeration.

This is the power of a woman’s orgasm. And if they don’t do any of the abovementioned, they will at the very least, walk around all day sulking and depressed like they were robbed for their purse — I have never spoken to a woman who could orgasm that has not described her lack of orgasm as being robbed. 

This is the power of a woman’s orgasm. And if they don’t do any of the abovementioned, they will at the very least, walk around all day sulking and depressed like they were robbed for their purse — I have never spoken to a woman who could orgasm that has not described her lack of orgasm as being robbed.

Isn’t that some shit? It is. This is why I say it is a gift. Not only is their orgasm more powerful than ours, but it comes in a greater variety, and has greater negative effects attached to its absence. Dick then is like medicine. It is what literally keeps them sane and in working order. It keeps them from becoming wild savages. And if we have this much power to affect them, why are we not treating our dick like a gift to be earned through good behavior?

To orgasm, a woman must be led through the work of a man. Usually teaching her how to let go, how to overcome her trauma (depending on how heavy it is), hitting it a specific way for a prolonged period of time or eating her out for a prolonged period with laser focus. Isn’t it funny how women have to be taught how to orgasm? And whose job is it to teach? Us men. 

***The greatest sexual pleasure they could ever receive will almost always, undoubtedly, come from the instruction, patience, discipline, and guidance of a man.*** 

**Principle 6: Dick Is To Be Rationed, Not Timely or Convenient**

This brings me to our final point. You cannot treat something as a gift if you give it away often or with expectation of frequency. Dick then should be rationed. I’ve had ex girlfriends and hookups call me selfish for not just giving them my dick. They would become insecure and feel rejected sexually. They would take that feeling of rejection and come at me with serious school shooter energy. They would question my sexuality and if I was gay or not. They would question if I was cheating. All sorts of shit. I broke not. 

And to reiterate, this isn’t about how to develop this level of discipline, but why you should. My approach to this is simply to watch whatever girl I’m with over the course of a week through text or when I hang out with them. I analyze their behavior, and everytime they fail to act submissively, combatively, or non-cooperative, I ding a little checkmark on the tally sheet of my mind. I say to myself, “That’s another day she isn’t getting dick/She isn’t going to get xyz from me acting like that.”

When they try to make a move on me sexually, I look at them like they’re crazy and vibe them out. I don’t tell them why I’m not giving it to them. If you tell them that gives them room to debate you and call you petty. However, women are not stupid. They eventually, rather quickly at that, figure out that their behavior has a direct correlation with how often I put out. It’s not malicious. It’s not because I hate them. It’s not because I’m on a power trip. 

***It’s because my dick is a gift and I know that it has the power to change their mind and their life. How can I give a woman that much power and peace, and she can’t be responsible with it? Many people would love to have a house or car just given to them, but they never manage to ask about how they will maintain it.*** 

***Basic budgeting and forecasting of expenses, risk management, contingencies, redundancies etc. I cannot give you this powerful gift if you cannot do the work to maintain it. That would not be fair to them. I cannot allow them to repeatedly frustrate themselves into psychobitch behavior that I am responsible for because they can’t get their fucking act together.*** 

That is why I ration dick to them. Rationing serves three purposes:

1. It reinforces that dick is a gift
2. It forces them to check their bad behavior
3. It forces her to respect the power of masculine principle. She can’t just get to the finish line and fuck the winner. She has to look at the journey and respect it 

And the beautiful part of all of this is that if she doesn’t respect your rationing process, then she can go away. You should only be dealing with women that submit to your program anyway. If she doesn’t recognize the gift of your penis in her mouth, the gift of being given purpose by a man, something which femininity craves, which they all want in some way or another subconsciously, then she can suffer out on the street with a dude who will give her what she wants.",1635703601.0
292,Responding to her bad mood.,210,qjlhmt,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qjlhmt/responding_to_her_bad_mood/,32,"Note, 
This is not a post for newbies or people that don't have basic game down.



Guys need to up their social skills under pressure. A skill thats rarely talked about is the push and pull dynamic of escalation and de-escalation. 

De-escalation is a powerful tool to have in your toolbox. It can show you how to save any immediate fuckups without killing attraction. And it can create comfort and trust with women, or just people. 

Sex and dating are stressful to some women. They put several hours into hair prep and makeup. Also, what to wear. I slap on a tight fitting t-shirt and jeans and roll out. 

When you are calibrating your level of push and pull you can go a little too far. Too quick with escalation or too bold.This is when a girl's fight or flight response kicks in. You need to simply stop and de-escalate. Just enough de-escalation for her to feel that buzz of energy and lose that hesitation or need to stop. 

*Give her the tingles in her body, not alarm bells in her head*. 

The best way to aquire this skill or tool set is to practice it without consequences. You don't want to practice this on your dates or meetups.  Instead, you practice this when the opportunity arises. 

When a girl is angry or frustrated, jump in and de escalate. You're not invested in any of her bullshit so you dont need a specific outcome from these encounters.  

Do gauge the situation.  Don't de-escalate violent situations. Thats usually too far gone to be worth the risk. 

Now you want rock solid frame and to exude a form of dominance? 

Meet a woman's anger head on and conquer it. That shows powerful command of your emotions. Also, that you can direct her emotions to your liking. 

A few days ago I went to a new build site for my business. An associate, Brian was supposed to set up licensing for the construction. 

I pull in to the parking lot at the licensing office to get paperwork. A blond lady is walking out. ""What do you want""? she snarled. 

""Hi there! I'm Musicgoon from ------. Brian sent me to get our licensing"".

""No, no, noo"", she states annoyed.
""I told Brian I wouldn't license anyone becase the paperwork was a mess"". 

""Well you happen to be in luck"", I say to her.
""I'm the guy holding the corrected paperwork"". 

The blond lady asked if it was really corrected? I confirm it. 

""This wasn't your mistake, so I don't expect you to fix it"". 

She asks if i can wait about 15 minutes. I tell her im going for some coffee then. No prob

When I came back,  we sat across from each other. She was 💯 USDA scowl. I looked directly at her. 

""Do you ever have one of those days that can only be described as a massive dumpster fire""? 

She looks up from her paperwork and directly at me. I look back at her and hold her eyes. I smile. 

""I know that Brian is probably having a worse day than both of us. His car window got broken and some of my work stuff was stolen from his car. 

""Maybe we can scold him together"", I say to her and laugh. 

""He needs to really make better decisions"", I say

I keep eye contact and laugh again. She sees this ands starts laughing with me. I watch her mood change. 

I say, ""Im glad we can laugh. I'm happy to see you smile"". The blond continues the licensing for me. 

She smiles and while she finishes the paperwork she says ,""we are near a casino, maybe we can grab a drink after work"". 

Now gentleman..... please take this from me.  Take your dominance of her frame and your ego boost and go. I declined drinks saying I was just too swamped, but flattered.  

Why do I say this? In the past i would get blowjobs or take these girls back to a quieter place. The sex was never worth the bullshit. these are high conflict, low stability women. Just too much drama....

Once you learn this skill, you can say the most blunt outlandish shit and be able to turn something around if you've gone a bit too far. 

You can also form a dominant dynamic with a girl where you dictate her mood instead of it running awry and you just dealing with it. 

This is comfort on a more advanced level. 

So how does this work? 

1. Start like there isn't something obviously wrong. 

2. State the obvious ,""you look (upset, angry, frustrated etc..). 

3. Give her a moment to have all of her emotions without being interrupted. 

4. Agree and Amplify. ""Wow you need a stiff drink and if you own a gun keep it secured"". 

5. Look at her and smile. The key is to not break eye contact until her mood changes. 

6. Compliment/reward her for breaking out of her negative thought patterns. 

Either you lead your interactions with people, or the interactions lead you. The idea is to set the tone and the mood. You do this boldly and effortlessly and she will follow your cues.",1635669972.0

This kind of post, that tells you to give up, has no place here, in a forum about improving yourself.

This is a defeatist mentality that will lose you the battle before it even starts. Believe it or not, you have every chance of winning that battle, should you put effort in. 

You're frail/skinny? Go to the gym. If you're under 20, expect your skeleton to still grow, especially if you lift (probably not in height though), as you're still far away from peak bone mass. I know plenty of skinny dudes who went to the gym and, although they're not nearly ""built"", they have managed to get a great body shape (including v taper) after as little as 2 years.

You're short? Take my example. I'm 5'7 and, while the average height might be 5'9 where I live, I don't know one guy who's taller than me and is under 5'10. Despite this instant game over I have managed to pull girls without unusual trouble all through highschool, I constantly got IOIs from 6-7s and sometimes above and managed to pull one of the high school hotties all before knowing about the red pill. Height only matters in your own context: your taller version would pull a bit more than you, but some other tall dude isn't entitled to the girls because he's tall, it's about the whole package. This goes for any of these.

Edit: You're ugly? Do orthotropics. Yeah, the older you are the longer it's gonna take, but real improvements can be made, and will be made provided you actually do it.

Extreme anxiety or gigashitty social skills: just do cold aproaches on everyone, basically. Start by saying hello to the cashier at the store, or asking the old dude at the bus station how his day is going. You should try to up the level of interaction every time you go out, just keep a bit out of the comfort zone, and you will get there. Also, meditation has greatly decreased my anxiety, and it will absolutely do the same for you if you do it daily for two weeks.

Autism: doing what I said above will help you at least to understand better social situations. You are human and will adapt to your environment, do not let anyone tell you that you can't do something you want to do. They will say the stuff that they say because they don't know of a counter example, but what if you were the first to accomplish it?

The point is, you won't know how it could have been if you don't try. In the case nothing works, you will be much better off just by having worked on yourself.

But it will work. Having whichever of these defects is not the reason for dying a virgin, there are just so many guys (and all of us know at least one) who have one or more of these traits and are not virgins. There's so many things you can do to improve yourself, imagine your level after you do them. Do you know what will 100% get you to die a virgin? Being the man who never tried to not die a virgin. The sad loser who chose to remain a sad loser.

The whole point of TRP *is not* to become an expert who is versed in all TRP laws and bylaws, then sit in the side lines. The point is to take a piece of advice that seems legit and go out into the real world to apply it.

##The Notes

-  #**The Power Of Validation**

- **Positive Validation**

I've recently started a new job as a college aged young man. I'm not sure what about this shopping center draws as many thick thots as it does, but man I am surrounded by beautiful women on a daily basis. So far in the past month, I've gotten 7 numbers, 2 dates, 1 steady girlfriend, 1 date in the pipeline and another im still gaming to the date. This will be about the one im still gaming.

When I first met the artsy girl, it was a brief *""hello, im your new co worker, ill catch you later.""* And left it at that.

A few days later im doing my thing - gaming girls getting numbers. I happened to be chatting up this pretty black girl and were having a good time. Convo is great, fun vibes were both laughing -- I see artsy girl in my peripheral vision watching this all go down. She starts walking closer and waving at me to get my attention. I ignore her. I keep gaming the girl im with now, even though the artsy girl is objectively badder than the black girl.

After I get the black girls number, I go up to the artsy girl and ask her whats up -- she's like *""oh nothing i just needed help with this thing over here.""* so I go to help her and I notice her shoes. They're Vans. I used to be a skater in my youth so I commented *""with shoes like those you must like skating!""*

One thing lead to another, we start talking, turns out she paints, i paint too. I get her Instagram.

Few more days pass and I see her again, now she always seems happy to see me. Goes out her way to say hi and smiles... all is well. She comes to find me cus she needs help with another thing and I just start teasing her -- *""I bet you're the type of girl who likes wine.""*

She happily starts talking about her favorite drinks, fruity types of alcohols. This is the most important thing I said to her: *""Oh... thats good. I like that. Most girls these days only drink hard liquors and thats so strange to me. Its cool to meet a girl who likes finer tastes. Anyways have you ever been to the XYZ paint bar? My friends and I are going there in 2 weeks.""*

Now alot is happening in what I just said so im going to break this down.

1.) I validated her in such a way that it was a man in a higher position approving of the girl who did something right for him. It wasn't *""oh my gosh wine is soo good whats your favorite?!?!""* just a simple *""I like that, heres why.""* *I approve of what you just said.*

I noticed the power of that was when we went from us having a 70/30 type of conversation, where I carried out most the work but she also did some work (no one word answers) to 50/50. Now not only is she still talking but now *she is asking me questions.* she's asking me what my favorite type of drink is. How did I develop that taste. Etc.

2.) I didn't let that approval or validation linger. The mistake most guys make is they'll say something cheeky, witty, or alpha -- but then the facade fades away when their puppy dog eyes tell the truth of the situation- they sit there waiting for the girl to say something like *""haha you're funny!""* the guy is still the one waiting for the approval! Just say what you need to say and keep the conversation flowing. Don't wait around for the girls reaction.

3.) I dropped a piece of my life that she relates to, alluded to a magic night i have planned with friends in a venue she's never been to but told me she really wants to go to. *Then I didn't invite her.* not only do I not want to bring this girl to meet other girls im going to the paint bar with, but by not inviting her right then and there she will be all the more excited when I do finally invite her, after I show her the pictures I took of my art with my other girlfriends.

- **Negative Validation**

My work place is a fast paced environment. I'm on the move with a steady step and sometimes I gotta rush past people. One woman didn't like that. She was alright looking, nothing to brag about, but do-able. 

Anyways I rush past her once and she tries giving me some lip. I ignore her and keep working. Walk by her again and she's like *""excuse me do you work here?""*

Im like *""yeah whats up you need help with anything?""* and she goes on a little rant about how I can't walk past her all fast don't be doing all that. I don't say a word except, *""i was walking fast?""* and she says *""yes you were.""*

I just said *""oh, okay""* and walked off.

I could hear her bitching to her friend about how *""yeah okay my ass did he just ya okay me no he didnt.""* I didn't think anything of it.

Later on, im on break, outside smoking the vape pen, and she comes out - guess she was looking for me. She needs my help. I just laugh to myself.

*""yeah I could help you after im done with break,""*

She's like *""what you can't help me now?""* to which I respond ""*I might have if you weren't yelling at me earlier, but its cool I got you after break.""*

Then she starts flat out hitting on me. *""oh what type of vape pen you have? What type of flavor is that? I got one too in my car let me go get it to show you.""* she goes to the car, grabs it and brings it back to show me. I say, *""oh yeah. I see.""*

No validation given, and she chased for it hard until break was over, I helped her out, and that was that. 

Ill let you guys try to analyze what happened there.

- #**If you let them go, they may boomerang back around**

In my old job I was smashing a co-worker and to make a long story short, we went our separate ways after she tried to put the pussy on hostage. I went out, found another girl, everything was fine. About 2 months later I get some cryptic text message from a random number. 

*""Hi, do you remember me?""*

It was an unknown number so I responded, *""who is this?""* not to be an asshole i just didn't have the number saved.

She texted back ""im your lover.""

I said ""which one?""

She then sent me a pic we took together but with her face cropped out, so I was like *""oh its you, what's up?""*

So we texted again, she's hitting me up from her real phone number now, and one day she happens to be up in my neighborhood. She wants to come over. I invite her in, share a little wine, and the rest is history. It was only one time though, she had a boyfriend when she stopped by that last time. Just wanted to wrap up our story in a pretty little bow called closure I guess.

So what happened here is, when the plate broke i did not give a single shit. I stopped calling, texting, and immediately found a new girl to hang out with. I guess the collective feminine unconscious relayed this message back to her and she had to come check up on me. 

Me and one of my buddies from TRP have a couple running jokes together. Two of them being that *""sometimes you gotta let a women sit in her pussy juices and let them stew.""* the other joke is that *""once a woman sleeps with you, she has to reach back out to you, out of self respect for herself.""*

- #**The Tactical Friendzone**

I went up to approach a hipster looking girl cus she had a phat ass and a pretty face. We get to talking and she turns out to be pretty weird. Quirky, I could get a long with her, but her moans would probably sound like a wildebeest and I wasn't down for all that. she likes art and music though, so I tell her *""hey how about we have an art session together, but just as friends though I already got a girlfriend.""* and she was like ""*OH WELL I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND TOO""* Awkward pause... *""yeah so whats your number? And your name? We will hang out some time!""* she texts me an hour later.

Other guys and girls at work saw that happen, got my respect up it seems from the way they talk to me. But, with this hipster girl, she's good looking enough to tag pics with on IG and let other bitches wonder *""are they smashing?""* plus besides her weird quirks I think we could be friends. We got the same interests. And she probably knows a couple other cute girls into the same shit we like so its an easy in.

- #**Being In The Moment, Authentically**

I owe this realization to Mike from the TRP discord - he helped me understand that its powerful to be who you are, and the best version of who you are, rather than a cheap imitation of someone you're not. There are some guys out here who are crazy good at playing pretend, making up a different character for each different girl they're seducing - and to them, i salute you - im not built like that. I have a way better time behaving as myself than trying to pretend I'm James Bond or John wick or some shit.

So anyways I'm standing outside work on smoke break again and I literally see a women with snow white skin, blood red hair down to her ass, thick rose pedal red lipstick, and a dark black noir Gothic dress that complimented her curves perfectly.

My authentic self is pointing out what I imagine things or people to be. To this girl, I said *""you look like you belong in a castle.""*

She was taken a-back, cracked a smile, laughed, and we got to talking. No game or scheme on my end, I was just in the moment having a good time with her.

I did this with another girl inside the store - thick booty thick legs inside workout pants - i could see a tramp stamp on the front of her belly cus her shirt was a crop top. I went up to her and said *""you look like you make good art.""*

She's like *""yes.""*

I said *""no way, what type of art do you make?""*

She says *""oh wait what? I'm sorry no.""*

Damn girl only speaks spanish. Luckily im tri-lingual.

So I start gaming her in Spanish, it's not really going anywhere, so I used negative validation.

*""Ahh, entonces no sos una artista?""* (Oh. So you're not an artist?""*

*""No, no soy.""* (No im not.)

*""Ah, entonces no podemos siguir hablando.""* (Oh. Then we can't keep talking anymore.)

Thats when I start to walk away and she kinda chases after me - *""wait but art is cool though! do you make art?""*

Showed her my art, transitioned to lifting and gym talk, felt her arms up and she felt mine, then got her Instagram.

But I was being authentic.

I wasn't plotting or scheming out a conversation in my head - *if she says this i say that* - i just let myself go on auto pilot and thats what happened..

Find the tools that best work in your repitore, master them to the point you can do them without thinking, just as easily as you breathe, then let lose.

Most men are addicted to at least one of these, and many men are addicted to two or more. The amount of time, energy, sperm, and brainpower they will sink into these habits is ruining their lives without them even knowing it.

They can do so much better, but they are too distracted to even realize it.

Part of taking the red pill and improving yourself as a man is recognizing the pitfalls men fall into and avoiding those pitfalls and time-wastes

> There's no point in making you memorize a bunch of equations. In the real world you'd be encouraged to look them up. You'll all be carrying computers in your pockets by the time you graduate anyways.

Out of infinite possibilities; you are here. Reading this. You have unlimited, great to terrible information online. On every topic under the sun. Pick your passions and you could spend multiple lifetimes, watching guides, reading all the *secret tips and tricks* from beginner to grandmaster proficiency. **It can certainly be overwhelming.**

Information overload at it's finest. *Just a little more...then I'll get started.* Educate yourself all you want on the topic but you're never going to truly understand until you get your hands dirty. 

Loving to cook but hating to spend time in the kitchen has forced me to develop a unique culinary style. Of course I asked Grandma for her cook books. Googling what spices pair well with what meats. Watching tutorials on how to properly slice and dice but none of that did jack shit to prevent me from fucking up hundreds of dishes.

Plenty of bad meals were ingested and admittedly a handful trashed so that today, when I go grab a pound of  ground beef, there's a variety of dishes with plenty of unique flavorings that can be put together. No measuring cups, weighing shit out or **relying on other people's instructions.** Through practice, cooking has morphed into an art form; a sprinkling of that, a pinch of this, squeezing a little citrus at the end. Most my meals whipped together now, are good. Ever once in awhile having slapped a Picasso together.
 
**What would sitting there reading recipe after recipe have done for me?**

Perhaps memorizing a few canned dishes. Relying on the measuring cups every time. Even then you can still burn the meat. Forget to stir the noodles. Instead I took those recipes, spent time and energy with them as guides. Turning them into meals, uniquely mine while **developing a skills.**

**Now why the hell would you hang around here, reading post after post, without going out into the field and getting your hands dirty?** While there a certainly aspects that hold true, once you've got the basic outline, you gotta get out there, testing yourself to really see what you're capable of.

This shit ain't rocket science, where you've only got one shot. Requiring years of preparation. It's akin to painting a wall. If you fuck up, sand the surface and start with a fresh bitch.

297,The two strategies of a cold approach.,224,qfzad3,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qfzad3/the_two_strategies_of_a_cold_approach/,40,"Behave in a way that invites or entices other people to be in your presence, instead of imposing your presence on people that otherwise wouldn't want to be there. -Tish- LTR of Musicgoon. 

I want to talk about two schools of thought regarding cold approach: 

All humans need to feel like they are wanted. we see younger and new guys that want to jump headfirst into relationships. Older guys that are tired of managing a soft harem, even the OLTR type of guy want some sort of mate. One can only rawdog rando's for so long before they yearn for something more meaningful. Getting repeat business and reliable sex is a respite from being on the prowl every single day. 

Do you consider yourself a guy thats on the prowl? You are the predator, women are the prey? Or do you want a girl to suppliment your already thriving life? 

A guy with a goal of picking up women, flips a power dynamic. These guys are asserting dominace over a woman to get her to agree with the guy for ,""more"". Because at that moment, she's only giving guys something nice to look at. Predator/prey makes the woman the prize. Its a halfway point between effective game and simping. You are in her frame trying to anticipate her next move. 

I recently went out with my oltr. I talked to 25 different women. I asked: Imagine if you're with your girlfriends and a good friend of yours says to you ,""I was at a bar and this really awesome guy picked me up"". What comes to your mind when you hear that? All 25 women stated that this sounds like some guy tricked her or is pulling some shady shit. 

I then asked these women ,""What if it was the same situation and your girlfriend said to you ,""Oh My gawd! I just met the hottest most amazing guy last night! I really was drawn to him! What would you think about this second scenario""?  The general anser was ,""Aww. I'd be so happy for her"". 

There are two standard methods of meeting women. Pickup is you going to a woman and trying to sell yourself. You are qualifying yourself to a woman. 

Attraction is the opposite. Women come to you and try to qualify themselves to you. 

Does pickup work? Sure! It can be done right and you will be mostly successful. 

However attraction is far superior. You might be saying ,""This shit is stupid Musicgoon. Why shouldn't I go out and practice my game""? 

You *should* practice your game bro. Adjust your focus. 

Attraction saves you time. You aren't taking chunks out of your day to cold approach. You're focused on your mission, your enjoyment and leisure. 

Attraction increases your retention rates. You want to get laid once or have repeats with the women of your choice. The first time with someone new is always a bit uncalibrated and it gets better as you learn each other. 

Attraction is genuine. New guy please read these next sentences: Don't fucking larp. You arent Chad Thundercock. Chances are your personality is incongruent with the character you made up. You're not a emmy winning actor and women will see this glaring discrepancy from miles away. In other words, you're going to look like a creepy piece of shit. Attraction is you being the ever-improving best version of yourself and women liking what they see. 

Attraction is good for your frame. You don't have to worry about acting like someone else. You'll know yourself so you'll be more at ease. Also you're confidence will skyrocket because girls will like you for who you are instead of who you're trying to be. 

With pickup things can get very stressful. It's a game of input and response. She says something, you respond. If she does something unpredictable you scan your memory banks for the corect thing to say. The correct way to act. Thats fucking exhausting. 

Anyways, you either get my point or are probably exhausted reading by now and are ready to say ,""Fuck Musicgoon. He's a fucking assmunch"".  Well I'm not going to leave you gentlemen without some practical advice. 

So lets dive into some of the ways that you can transition from pickup to attraction. 

The first exercise would be to read the sidebar in a different way. The sidebar is tools. We as guys focus on the literal part of the sidebar.

Have you ever seen guys on manosphere forums that state ,""The redpill law states_____"". Well congrats Lew the Lemming, you just flushed your autonomy and personality down the toilet! You need to embrace your individuality for attraction. 

Read the sidebar again and think about context: What is the underlying message and how can I relate that to myself? 

A man that really knows himself is very attractive to women. He knows what he wants, he knows his strengths and he can laugh at himself for his mistakes and shortcomings. 

Next tip: When someone shows strong attraction to the person they want, that makes them more attactive. 

Ex: So handsome ol' Musicgoon was at a rock festival. He was having fun rocking the fuck out when a girl approached him over by the beer tent. She wasn't his Type. A bit too skinny and with a short purple pageboy haircut. Also, she had a peculiar shaped nose. She locked eyes with Musicgoon and said ,""Damn you're super hot! With those muscles and tattoos.... mmm hmm!  I told myself, I want to climb that tree""!  

So picky Musicgoon changed his mind after he felt thouroghly desired. He thought ,""Dayuuum! This chick is fucking hot! She's *definely* going to get this""! 

This gentleman, is bold overt flirting. It's knowing yourself and you value. This cuts through the bullshit and says, ""I like you and I'm telling you what I want"". It shows that you understand yourself.

Lets go back to pickup... When you do pick-up, you zero in on a target or a set. You focus you time and energy on one group or one girl. This is acutely myopic. In other words, you don't diversify your options. Think of pickup as really short bursts of oneitis and attraction as a game of spinning plates. You are engaging multiple people in the immediate area. Heres an example: 

Musicgoon goes to a bar. Theres a short line to get in. He notices a couple walking two pugs. he stops and asks if he can pet their dogs. He spends some time interacting with the dogs and briefly talks to the couple. He learns that the couple is new to the area. He chats and then says have a great night. He hops in the bar line and sees two cute blond girls in front of him. He listens and stands back. The girls are saying how cute the dogs are. Musicgoon asks them if they got a chance to pet them? The blonds say no. He talks about the dogs and the couple and tells a story about his daughters chiweenie. Then, he pulls back as to not overstay his welcome. (start a chat, make your presence known and move on). 

Musicgoon talks to a girl at the bar with a crazy looking banzai tattoo. He talks to the girl for a while, touches her tattoos, gets his drink and walks away. He talks to another girl that looks like Natalie Dormer. He asks her if shes ever heard that before. Her boyfrend comes up to see his girl talking to Musicgoon. Musicgoon greets him ,""whats uo bro"", and gives the guy fistbump"". He asks the guy if hes ever heard of Natalie Dormer? The two guys talk about Game of Thrones. He makes his presence known and he walks away. The couple with the pugs come into the bar. Musicgoon walks to the cute blonds he met and puts his hands on their shoulders.

""Hey ladies! You get your chance! The dogs are in the bar. Let's go pet them!  He grabs the girls by the hands and leads them to the dogs. And he walks away. In a few short minutes he's talked to the majority of the bar and now has carte blanche to go talk to anyone for any reason. And people see Musicgoon making people smile. His social proof and presence are off the charts and he has taken up space in the bar. This is very attractive.  Musicgoon now has multiple irons in the fire. 

This is how you spin plates in a social situation.  Brief fun conversations, then walk away. Make yourself known to everyone around you. 

Another tip: You need get a woman to invest in you. Women aren't interested in the journey. don't bore them with your career talk or dry shit. What they want to hear is ideas of a romantic future. You are paint her a mental picture.  Here's another story: 

Musicgoon is at a quiet coffee shop. He starts talking to a cute redhead. He gets her engaged in the conversation and laughing. They get into the subject of photography. Musicgoon asks ,""Have you ever heard of the International Balloon Fiesta in NM? ""Its one of the most photographed events in the world"". 

Musicgoon tells a story of walking through field filled with hot air baloons. He talks about a night glow where all of the hot air balloons light up the the night sky. 

""It really feels completely surreal and beautiful"", Musicgoon says. Musicgoon shows pictures of the event from google. *""I think it would be magical* to go there next year when it happens.

Now notice the words in that last sentence: ""Magical"", as a word, brings out strong emotions in women. Now Musicgoon didn't invite her. He didnt make any promises. Women  love the idea of something romantic. Solipsism makes her insert herself into that story. You start the story and she places herself in as one of the leading roles.

Start this journey off by knowing youself and being honest about what you want. And know that attraction is a slower pace, but yields better connections and passionate sex.",1635225289.0
298,How to Take Nude Pics with Girls,18,qfzn64,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qfzn64/how_to_take_nude_pics_with_girls/,15," So, you’ve had some bedroom rendezvous with a girl, and you’d like some saucy pics or videos to remind yourself of the wild romp you two are sharing. Guys overthink it and overcomplicate it, asking “How do I get a girl to *let* me take nudes?”

It’s not something you need to “make her do” – you just have to use your words like an adult and ask. She’ll either be up for it or she won’t. My buddy just straight up says “Yo, you’re super hot – lemme take a pic real quick. Cover your face if you want.”

I do similar – I tend to be a very complimentary person – I give a lot of compliments to people in my life. So it’s very easy for me to say during sex, “You’re so insanely sexy, you’re turning me on like crazy. Seriously, wait right here.” I’ll go grab my phone, come back & say, “You’re so sexy I *HAVE* to take a photo of your incredible body.”

A lot of girls are *very* keen to show off for you, especially when they can see how much their body turns you on. It’s a huge compliment and ego boost for a lot of them. Some of the more cheeky girls will even say, “Sure I’ll pose for you, so you can jerk off to me later 😉 😉 😉 “

If you plan on showing/sending it to any of your mates or uploading it on a forum or something, make sure she’s cool with that too. Just throw out a casual, “Yo, mind if I show your body off to my mates?” Again, if you ask, most girls are fine with it. I've got a tonne of examples of pictures of girls I've been with [linked here](https://killyourinnerloser.com/how-to-take-nude-pics-of-girls/) so you know I'm not full of shit. As per this post they've all given permission.

Generally speaking, most girls don’t mind you sharing their photos **as long you block out their face completely** and any other identifiable information (tattoos, jewellery, birthmarks, face, etc) so nobody can tell it’s them. That way it just looks like a nude photo of some random person, rather than *her.* I always show the photo to them before I upload it to make sure they definitely approve.

Sometimes a girl will be a little shy (but still clearly keen), so I’ll say, “No I’m serious, I’m taking a photo, you are *way* too hot – I have to remember this moment. You cool with it?” If she’s still clearly into the idea but a little nervous, I’ll ask, “Ok, what if we put the blindfold on you so your face is covered?” If she’s cool with it, then I’ll take the picture. **If she’s still a little unsure or hesitant, I don’t take the pic** – don’t push someone to do something they don’t seem all that keen to do. Especially when it comes to them being in a vulnerable position, naked in your bed. This stuff is way more fun if she’s *really* into it – it’s not fun feeling like you’re pressuring someone into doing something.

Sometimes girls will want to take a pic with you, but not a nude one of their body. In that case, get under the blankets with her so you’re both covered, and tell her you want to take a cute selfie of the two of you. Your bodies will be covered up but it’ll be obvious you’re both naked in bed, which is proof enough. Most girls are pretty cool with this – it’s just a selfie. (Again, if she asks you not to, respect her wishes and don’t take any photos.)

Sometimes when you break up with a girl, **she might ask you to delete all the photos you have of her.** Obviously do so. I’ve only ever had 2 girls ask me to delete all their photos. It actually made me feel a little sad – these were 2 girls I’d dated for about a year each, and hitting that *Delete* button was painful; deleting all the memories I had of them felt like I was erasing them from my life. Somewhat like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

# Artsy Photoshoots

Once you’re more comfortable with a girl and you’ve seen each other a few times, you can tell her you’d like to do an actual “photoshoot” with her; ie an artsy/nude photoshoot. A lot of girls *love* the idea; especially if you try and make the photos classy/artsy.

This is something I’ve been more into lately, and my girls fucking love it. It’s a hell of a lot of fun coming up with photo ideas together, shooting a bunch of photos until you get one that looks awesome, trying out all the toys together, trying different poses, etc. It’s also a lot of fun getting each other all worked up (it’s pretty erotic taking nude photos of someone), then banging each other like mad afterwards.

It also feels a lot better taking photos *with* a girl, rather than *of* her – it’s like you’re sharing something fun together, rather than you just quickly snapping a boring smartphone photo of her. You get to pretend to be all *artsy* and sophisticated and shit.

The link earlier in the article shows some examples of what I mean.

# The Takeaway

So if you want to take nude photos of girls, *you literally just have to ask for it.* Guys tend to overthink it and ask me, “How can I convince a girl to let me take nude photos of her?” It’s not something you have to “trick” or pressure her into doing – **Just use your words and ask like an adult.** The worst that could happen is she says no.",1635226803.0
299,The only advice that works,128,qeqyxv,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qeqyxv/the_only_advice_that_works/,56,"Advice sucks. Most of the time it isn't advice, it's some bozo half way around the world espousing his values (read: hopes) as if they were commandments. e.g.:  

""Find a girl with no tattoos or bad things will happen""  
""Find a girl with a low notch count or bad things will happen""  
""Find a girl who goes to church or bad things will happen""  

And the few people giving advice that don't just preach from a soapbox of frustration are giving pure guesswork. There are literal high school kids in here giving everyone advice for life, all of it. They aren't even economically independent, but know what's best for you. Now chances are, if you are on this subreddit, you're not in a place to know what's great life advice or not. You see all this rabble and look to the upvote counter and hope you can tell the good from the bad. Maybe you do know your stuff and want to polish off a few rough edges. For you this looks like the old fashioned

""The subreddit is going downhill""  

I may be that idiot that spent too much time on Reddit, but I have only ever seen one piece of advice in here that was any use for me. One piece of advice that works 100% of the time, one piece of advice that actually works, one piece of advice that stands up to scrutiny. And it's this:

#I tried this and it did that

One simply little trick, 7 words that helped me see what worked and what didn't. Using the frontpage as I write this, I'll show you what I mean

*1. About the psychological nature of inceldom*  
> The link most radfems miss when analyzing inceldom is the that, if you take your time to read the inceldom fanfiction, you will recognize three very important personality traits : a) depersonalization/derealization, b) alexithymia and c) dissociation.

*2. The Red Pill/SMP Singularity: If only you knew how bad things really were*

> You have to work to make 150k/year MINIMUM, to satisfy most women's income requirements in the future.  
> You need to be able to afford the fancy skin treatments, hair transplants, potentially even plastic surgery, that tik tok Chads are getting. You need to maximize you looks as much as possible. Never has it ever been more important to be an 8/10 in looks than now. (Red pill boomers will say, ""Nooooo that's beta"" Shut up bro, we're entering a new age, where men have to worry about being just as pretty as women.)  
> You need to focus on your health and fitness. Having a good body will be mandatory, and you need to stay healthy and alert to compete in the future hyper-competitive SMP  
> You need to have the financial option to leave the west if necessary. Because as I may or may not discuss in part 2, the west will begin to collapse by 2055.

*3. Frame = Values*

> Most liberals try to solve problems from a “fairness” frame. They believe the best way to solve problems is through the use of the “value” called “fairness.” There’s nothing inherently wrong with the value of fairness, it’s a trait that’s had a positive impact on our evolution. It’s about whether fairness is best to solve a specific problem in a specific circumstance.  
>Frame = Moral Values, yes like in a Disney movie.

You get the point. They all have something in common. It's someone telling you their opinion who hasn't done shit. Great ideas, no follow through. This is functionally useless to you, and the only thing it achieves is bloating the ego of whomever is writing it. You either upvote it and they feel validated, or you downvote and they feel like the martyr, who's just too smart for you plebs to 'get it'. I don't know about anyone else, I refuse to be the lube for someone's mental masturbation. 

Instead, here's great example from the same frontpage. Some indian dude actually tried shit and posted results.

*1. I just lost my virginity at 21 years old. Wanted to share my experience and thank you all*

> Since then, I implemented a lot of the advice that you guys told me. Lost weight (45lbs), got in shape, wore better clothes, started talking to girls and so on.  
> From the last 1 year my college was closed, so I came back a month ago and today I finally hooked up with a chick after making out with her 3-4 times. She has a boyfriend who's not in college right now and in her words, she wanted to fuck me because 'I became too hot' for her xD ...

It's simple stuff, boring stuff. Stuff that takes time, patience, and most importantly, consistency. He did X and achieved Y. Now I know to anyone who actually fucked on the regular it seems to basic that it's boring, and that's the point: The advice isn't the goal, the results are. So my advice, which you can take or leave, is to remove any nonsense in here unless you see the author actually committing to action before he runs his mouth. After all, why would you commit to someone's advice on here if he won't even commit himself? I'm sure there's a post on the sidebar that talks about overinvestment being a bad covert contract and good way to get taken advantage of with women. Simply extend that to user redpill420_69 and you're golden.

Granted, your TRP browsing experience will start to get a lot smaller. You'll find 90% of posts here are hot garbage, and 90% of people here have 'born to lose and loving it' tattooed onto their forehead. Besides, you're doing them a favour, the less attaboys they get for their meaningless drivel, the faster they hit rock bottom and start doing something else with their day.",1635077572.0
300,About the psychological nature of inceldom,18,qensu6,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qensu6/about_the_psychological_nature_of_inceldom/,17,"Lets get this rolling then. 

The link most radfems miss when analyzing inceldom is the that, if you take your time to read the inceldom fanfiction, you will recognize three very important personality traits : a) depersonalization/derealization, b) alexithymia and c) dissociation. 

Now, these traits are shared among several personality disorders, the most common one being Borderline Personality Disorder or BPD. So even though being an incel is no indication of such person having BPD, a male with BPD has higher chances of being an incel. 

The first point is depersonalization/derealization. If you analyze their own testimonies, most incels feels that they are basically “living in a bad video game”, or better said, that they “do not actually belong to society/reality”. Now add alexithymia onto the mix, and you will see that in top of that, they see their own interpersonal relations as dysfunctional and broken. I you wonder why they act so unempathetic towards females in general, to the point of raw hatred, that is the reason. Now comes the final piece of the puzzle : dissociation. Incels are also dissociated from their own selves. It doesn’t matter that they might be reasonably attractive, intelligent or even charismatic; they have become detached from themselves up to the point of seeing their own self an impostor image of an ugly, incapable, self-alienated person. That’s why telling them to “improve themselves” or “self-actualize” is futile. You are trying to appeal to a self that is not completely connected to their own self-image. 

Let’s put them all together to understand the phenomema then. No matter the actual physical or personality traits, the incel sees life as a bad cheap imitation of reality in which they are an ugly, un-capable, worthless individual who is also detached from meaningful emotional connections. 

Now if the consequences of that combo reminds you to a very different psychological phenomena, you are not wrong. Same symptoms, different causes. And that’s many incels claim they become “happy” taking applying the same “solution”.

Now why do feminists refuse to acknowledge the connection between inceldom and this very obvious psychological traits ?

The reason is that then they will have to admit that they are one of the main causes of this phenomena in the first place. 
When you create a culture that foster extreme sexual polarization ( a consequence of sexual liberation movement ), is par for the course that , in the end you will be heavily penalizing those who are deem “unfit” for the environment, since you are reducing opportunities for males to reproduce. That’s what induces the derealization/depersonalization in those males, since they feel “out of reality” ( the reason is obvious ). The other consequence of sexual liberation is the commoditification  of sex and dissociation of sex and emotion, this is what leads to alexithymia. Which male wants to feel something towards a female who only values the guy for his net worth, education and looks?. Which male can feel appreciated or validated if women only do that if you are an alpha fucktoy ?. That environment only foster one thing : lack of empathy towards affective relations. On top of that, feminists have created an environment in which males lack any possible role model in which they can build their own masculinity ( feminists use the term “healthy masculinity” to induce feminized behavior in men at the same time that they complain about feminized men invading their spaces ). That makes impossible for most males to connect to who they are or even build a healthy identity as the men they are. In turn, they end up internalizing everything that feminism tells them that they are : rapist, abusers, misogynists, cry-babies, etc,  up to the point of considering then less than human. So why wouldn’t those males want to involuntarily escape reality when they have no basis upon which connect with their true selves ?.

As you see, the links are obvious, but feminist will never acknowledge them.",1635062781.0

302,How Do You Know When It’s OVER?,166,qd95me,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qd95me/how_do_you_know_when_its_over/,142,"# Intro:

Welp, it's official. Black Pill seems to have taken over this subreddit.

And that's okay.

Times change. Trends change. Culture changes.

GayLubeOil posts = instant downvote brigade

Prostitution posts = instant upvotes

To stay current with the times, it's important that we don't simply dismiss BlackPill as being for incels and losers, but that there are many valid points that are worth considering.

Ideas don't simply take hold of a generation of young minds without some sort of merit.

# Is it Over?

Oftentimes, I see perfectly normal looking guys posting on here complaining about how they can never get laid because they're not facially attractive enough, or that they're too short.

A lot of the times, I even see weird obscure concerns like ""my eyes aren't deepset hunter eyes enough"" that just make you go WTF, where do you even find this kind of stuff?

That being said, there are indeed certain qualities and characteristics that will severely hamper your success with women, and it's important to be aware of these as well, so you know that you have a difficult journey ahead and don't expect instant or even normal results for your efforts.

With that being said, here are some common insecurities that are brought up over and over again.

# Valid Concerns: When it’s Over Before It Began…

**Short:** 

By short we mean 5’7” and below in the USA.

Based on everything I’ve seen, being short does seem to automatically disqualify you in the eyes of the vast majority of women.

In other words, you can approach them all you want, but if you don’t meet the initial height requirements, which is at least 5’9”, it was over before it began.

Sorry bro.

I know it’s important to be positive, but part of RedPill is embracing cold harsh truths over easy to digest lies.

And I know everyone has a friend that gets laid despite being short but you’ll often find great social skills, money, muscles, or a combination of other compensating factors to make up for the height.

When I say it’s OVER, I don’t really mean it’s over no matter what you do.

Everyone can make it if they put enough effort into compensating in every other category. But let’s be honest, statistically most people who have a harder road than normal quit before getting good.

Few are actually willing to grind it out at something they’re naturally at a disadvantage in.

If you’re short and you’re reading this feel free to prove me wrong.

Just be aware that if you’re seemingly doing all the right things, like approaching girls, lifting, advancing your career but still struggling with women, it’s because dating life is on hard mode for you.

*Final Verdict: Is it Over? Yes.* [*Always Has Been*](https://imgflip.com/i/5rdcsm)*.*

**Lack of V Taper:**

Do you naturally have narrow shoulders and a big waist?

If so, it may just be over for you before it ever began…

I’ve seen this over and over again. Tall 6’4” guy complains that he can’t get girls at all.

They all sound the same. “I’m tall! Why don’t girls want me?”

And the answer is that being tall while having a skinny lanky frame with narrow shoulders is simply not attractive to women.

Based on what I’ve seen, it can be extremely difficult for taller guys to pack on enough muscle mass to get that V Taper if they’re not genetically incline for it.

Heavy heavy lifting and clean eating for 6+ years and/or 1-3 steroid cycles seems to be the only way for some people to fix this.

And what if you’re short AND have no V Taper?

Then all I have to say is: [THIS…](https://imgflip.com/i/5rdcsm)

*Final Verdict: Shoulder Press, incline bench, weighted pull ups until you can’t do anymore. Lift lift lift like your life depends on it. V Taper = girls. No V Taper = Forever Home Alone*

**Being Asian or Having an Indian Accent in the Mid Atlantic USA**

If you’re Asian or have an Indian Accent in one of the following states: 

Upstate New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia, and West Virginia…

You’re fucked.

Indians do okay if they don’t have the accent. Not so much when they do.

Asians… be prepared for a long war

In these States, you are simply NOT seen as a sexual option by the majority of women there.

The Mid Atlantic is where I personally started out learning game so yes, it can be done but you absolutely cannot fuck up in any way.

Everything has to be on point. Whitewashed haircut and clothes or hip hop style are the only styles that pull there if you’re Asian.

Be prepared for rejection after rejection before you get good.

*Final Verdict: Move to another State. Experience life on easy mode.*

**Autism:** 

Occasionally I see guys that can approach 50 girls a night no problem.

Then I discover that despite putting in so much time and energy into it, they’re still not getting laid.

And when I talk to them on Discord, the answer is painfully obvious: autism, either diagnosed heavy autism or undiagnosed light autism

If there was ever a death sentence with women, it’s autism.

Even seemingly good looking guys won’t get laid if they are too far in the spectrum.

Every action you do simply comes across weird to the girl. They way you walk, the way you speak, your vocal tonality, your body language…

Everything is just off.

And women don’t like that.

I’ve seen light autism get treated through finding a socially skilled friend or mentor and learning from them over the course of a couple years

But if you’re heavily socially autistic, my recommendation is to do whatever the fuck you can to fix the social skills before even thinking about approaching girls.

The social skills are the base requirement for the pickup skills.

The worst part is that when autistic people lock into a specific topic like RedPill or Pickup, they often work waaaay harder than the average guy.

They have this belief that if they do 1,000 approaches, a lay is just around the corner…

Unfortunately what actually ends up happening is they just reinforce weird social skills and bad habits over and over again which only leads to more failure.

*Final Verdict: It’s Over. You can look like Brad Pitt and it would still be over until you fix the autism.*

**Severe Social Anxiety:** 

And… I don’t even think this needs to be mentioned because it’s so common sense but…

If you can’t even go into a roomful of people without having a panic attack…

If the idea of talking to a girl gives you nausea from being so anxious…

It’s Over Before it Even Began.

*Final Verdict: Man the fuck up.*

# Common Misconceptions: When Is It NOT Over?

**Bald/Balding:**

Balding = Yes. It's Over. Better to be completely Bald than balding. Look at a picture of [Jeff Bezos](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/19/21/427F383B00000578-0-image-a-11_1500496239125.jpg) before and after. My recommendation if you're balding is to either do an aggressive hair recovery plan with Minoxidil, RU-58841, Finasteride, Microrolling, and possibly hair transplants or just shave it off completely.

Bald = Not really. I've seen too many bald men succeed with women to even consider hair a major disadvantage at all. The head shape doesn't even have to be particularly aesthetic. Women simply don't care about baldness as much as you think as long as you shave it all.

My theory is that an overabundance of testosterone and DHT directly leads to baldness so women can subconsciously sense that bald = high test.

You really don't even need an attractive head shape to pull it off. Just shave the combover.

*Final Verdict: No, it's NOT over. Feel free to do Roids to your heart’s content. Muscles > Hair for every race of women except for Asian girls.*

**Facially Average/Ugly:**

Honestly, unless you're in some East Asian country that values the pretty boy look like South Korea, most women around the world simply don't put that much weight on facial aesthetics.

Look around you sometime and take a look at the couples walking past you at the mall.

You'll often notice guys with seemingly ugly facial features with smoking hot women.

The natural reaction is to think, ""Oh he must be rich and she’s a gold digger”

But based on my experience, facial aesthetics simply don't really play as much of a role in attraction as most guys assume.

Put a picture of a narrow shoulder male model looking guy on Tinder and a picture of an ugly but jacked and shredded gymbro and I guarantee you, the gym bro will outpull the male model looking dude.

*Final Verdict: No, it's NOT over.*

**Beta Skull Shape:**

You ever see [this picture](https://twitter.com/damianprosa/status/1002881570552926209)?

I’ve seen it more than a couple times and let me just say it’s complete bullshit.

There’s no such thing as a certain type of skull with deepest eyes that will get you laid.

What I think it actually is is that the guy with the “beta” skull shape doesn’t lift so he naturally has a weak neck which makes the back of his head protrude.

*Final Verdict: lol skullshapes*

**Small Penis:**

Penis size doesn’t matter. You see...

haha just kidding if you have a small dick it‘s OVER

*Final Verdict: it’s OVER*

**Depressed:**

Believe it or not some of the very best seducers are depressed and play the good looking brooding guy game to perfection.

Women have natural maternal instincts and want to cheer someone up when they’re down.

The Caveat is that this man must have enough value.

Therefore if you’re good looking no need to see a therapist for depression. You’ll probably attract more women going to a bar and being your sad self than trying to fake being happy

303,Stop Being a Cunt to Yourself,292,qd4yl9,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qd4yl9/stop_being_a_cunt_to_yourself/,30," Yes, **\*you\***.

This is a friendly reminder to stop being such a fucking cunt to yourself.

If you’re anything like me (if you’re on my site, you probably are), you have extremely high standards for yourself. You have big dreams, lofty goals, high hopes – and you’re furiously working towards them (or, you’re in the process of working up the courage to *start* working towards them). **You’re a man on a mission.**

And boy have you dedicated yourself to this mission. You spend hours a day working towards your gym goals, reading self-improvement sites, working on your Tinder/Hinge/etc, improving your fashion, learning to be better with girls, making progress on your goals, a little at a time. You’re acutely aware of everything you have to do to get to where you want to be, and by Christ, you’re going to hustle like mad until it’s done.

But every now and then, or maybe every single day, you have missteps. You make mistakes, you get something wrong, you do something silly. Sometimes you have a lazy day/week where you make no progress towards your goal, instead choosing to self-medicate with video games/TV/porn/alcohol. And it crushes you, because you know you have a million things you *should* be working on… Yet here you are, *wasting precious time*.

That inevitably leads to you beating yourself up, often with horrible self-talk that borders on the self-abusive. You yell at yourself, telling yourself not to be such a pussy, not to be such a lazy bastard, not to be such a *fucking failure*. “Other guys aren’t fucking up this badly, it’s only me that’s a loser”.

It’s an easy trap to fall into. A tonne of us are assholes to ourselves because we’re not where we want to be and haven’t achieved the goals we want to achieve. We beat ourselves over the head and berate ourselves for not being good enough, flagellating ourselves for our perceived failures, wondering if we’ll ever manage to get our shit together. We act like totalitarian dictators, refusing to accept anything but 100% perfection… a standard that isn’t even remotely possible.

In short, we’re total *cunts* to ourselves.

The question to ask yourself is: **would you treat your best friend like this?**

No?

Why is it *not* ok to treat others like shit, but somehow it’s ok to treat *yourself* like shit? Are you somehow so special – more special than anybody else – that you deserve special punishment you wouldn’t dole out to even your worst enemy?

Drop your fucking ego – **you are not special**. The arrogance you must have to think you deserve special punishment nobody else deserves… You’re not any more important than anyone else, so don’t treat yourself like shit if you wouldn’t treat others like that. Sure, have high standards for yourself (lord knows I do); but don’t be a toxic asshole to yourself when you have moments of imperfection.

Self-improvement is supposed to be something you enjoy; a fun journey you spend the rest of your life going after. More on that idea [here](https://killyourinnerloser.com/self-improvement-is-a-lifelong-endeavour/). It’s not supposed to be an excuse for you to berate yourself or indulge in hateful self-talk. **Self-improvement is not a stick you hit yourself over the head with.**

I have as much experience with this as anybody – I used to have the most evil self-talk imaginable. Any time I made a mistake or failed at something, I’d tell myself, *“You’re such a useless piece of shit, you never get anything right. You’ll never make it if you keep fucking up like this.”* I didn’t allow any room for mistakes or missteps, expecting myself to be 100% perfect, 100% of the time.

Over time, and with techniques like *Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT)*, I worked on reframing those negative thoughts into more positive ones. I reframed “You’re useless” into “You’re only human”. “You never get anything right” became “You sometimes make mistakes, and that’s ok. Don’t stress.” “You’ll never make it” became “You’ll make it, as long as you just never quit”.

Over time I became a more positive, self-loving person, and I learned to stop being such a fucking *cunt* to myself. It took a *lot* of work and a lot of patience, but I eventually got there.

The antidote is to be *kind* and *forgiving* to yourself when you have moments where you know you can do better. Talk yourself up, rather than beating yourself down. “Come on, I know I can do better than this. I *am* better than this. Ok, I’ve got this – I’m gonna kick some fucking ass.” Give a pep talk to yourself, pick yourself up, and force yourself to do better.

“Don’t be such a cunt to yourself” has also worked wonders for plenty of my friends, family, and quite a few of my coaching clients. One mate in particular had some very clearly negative self-talk right from the very first time I met him. I waited til he’d finished speaking, paused for dramatic effect, and said, “Mate. You are an absolute *cunt* to yourself.” It floored him.

It’s insane how much of a radical concept *“Don’t be a cunt to yourself”* is for most of us. When you’re laser-focused on self-improvement, and you’re constantly looking to the future, it can be hard to look back and give yourself credit for the things you’ve already achieved.

As much as we don’t like to admit it, we’re only human. We’re going to have good days, and bad days, and days in-between. We’re going to totally suck sometimes. We’ll have days where we crush it and make massive progress towards our goals… and we’ll have days where we do absolutely nothing. As long as you’re making progress over time, you can’t beat yourself up for having a few lazy/crappy days here and there. Be kind to yourself. Be your own best friend.

**Remember, you’re not the enemy.**

304,How taking the Pill led me to leave my high school friends and rebuild my social net worth,88,qd7lu9,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qd7lu9/how_taking_the_pill_led_me_to_leave_my_high/,23,"I went to a fairly small high school (about 400 kids total). You needed to take a test and get a certain score to get in, so mostly everyone was a bit nerdy.

There was a frat atmosphere amongst the dudes in my grade. There were only 100 kids in the grade and everyone knew each other, each others business. Word would spread around fast. I was a shy kid coming in from a conservative family. I was a short, very skinny kid just trying to find my way around.

Suddenly I found myself atop the social food chain just because kids thought I was funny. I saw this as a way to fit in, so I played it up, exaggerated and became overly dramatic to get some laughs. I wasn't even studying anymore, I was just focusing on being entertaining and funny during classes. Friends would try to take as many of the same classes as me just to join in on the fun. My social status skyrocketed and it felt like a high I never experienced. It felt good to have people around you make you feel like the man all the time. 

Despite all that, I was still awkward around girls, and I was still very skinny. I never ended up with a girlfriend. Most of the girls were unattractive but there were a few that weren't, and EVERY guy went after them. Little did I know at the time, it was straight up beer goggles, when there were only 50 girls in the grade, a 7/10 looked like a 9/10.

Anyway fast forward to after high school, everyone moves onto college but still remain in close touch. I still had my circle of friends and still felt like a star. Then one day it hit me, I was 25 and haven't had a relationship since middle school. And it was going to continue that way if I kept hanging out with the same friends. All the hanging out, group chats, fantasy football seasons together, **masked** the fact that we were fucking unattractive losers in the real world and no body gave a fuck about us. All the inside jokes we thought were so funny had meant jack shit to people outside. Girls at the bars would look at us like a bunch of outcasts and I was the only one that seemed to notice. 

One day I said fuck it, I started going on dating apps, I started going to clubs by myself. I started studying material from this reddit. I read the book ""Squat Everyday"" and started working out every single day. I was beginning to date attractive girls, shit I never expected. They were way more attractive than the girls from high school. I focused on my financial goals and hit milestone after milestone. I started spending time with people who were successful and attractive, which led to more dating and business opportunities. Things just kept snowballing the right way.

I wanted to share this for the people out there that are knowingly or unknowingly ""stuck"" in their social circle because of their high school, college days. It took a long time until I started objectively looking at my friends and realize the truth. The truth was we were all unattractive, group of dudes who never improve ourselves because we always fucking laugh, hype each other up and feel comfort by being in the group. 

Where are those friends now? They actually never ended up dating anyone OUTSIDE their social circle. They all married girls from the same high school, yes even after going through college, the workplace, the best shot they had was from high school. Now all my high school friends see me as a traitor for leaving the group.

Chillin with my high school buddies made me feel like the man and that everything was going well. It wasn't until I stopped investing time in them that I started to see reality and really grow up. It was very hard to leave them, but I'm happy I did.",1634870726.0
305,Five years ago I was about to kill myself..,498,qc791v,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/qc791v/five_years_ago_i_was_about_to_kill_myself/,79,"Five years ago I was searching the internet for a painless method to end my life. Before I do that, I just wanted to know ""why?"". What crime I did or what I am doing wrong to deserve such life.   


Why girls can't see me as a human who can have sexual needs, why they behave differently around me and completely different around every other guy. Why my own friends turned against me and made fun of me instead of defending from the guy who bullied and humiliated me. Why I am judged harshly, why I am made fun of, why people don't respect me even when I sacrifice my own well-being for them.  


Another girl had told me that she can only see me as a friend, and I should keep in touch with her. I did whatever she said. She told that she don't like men who are want relationship to have sex, she told she like compliments, she told she likes the attention I give. I did everything she said, why she left me for her ex who do the opposite of all that. It don't make any sense.   


I want answers before I kill myself. I went to relationships sub, told them my situation. Some woman tell me to not date for at least 10 years and I need to work on myself before I even think about dating. Why I have to wait when everyone else is enjoying their youth, I am now more frustrated to know the answers.  


I am tired of hearing women, they speak the same. The same pattern. It's not the few rejections and miserable social life that is making me kill myself, it's the pattern. Seeing that the pattern would continue no matter what I do. It's seeing that things would be the same and never change made be think that there is no point in continuing the misery.   


Had a father whom I once told as a kid that some kids outside had beaten me up, and I need his help to take revenge from them. I saw fear in my father's eyes, he stepped back. And after few moments of thinking he started beating me saying that I must had something wrong to them. He beat his son who came home covered in bruises who asked his help because the other kids were outnumbered. The beaten kid needed a father figure who can protect him, but instead he got a realization that he don't have a father and he is all alone in this world. Long story short I never had a masculine role model to guide me.  


I searched for answers on subs that were made by men for men. I think they were related to hobbies and activities men can do alone or develop some skill. I have no recollection that how I landed on the sidebar of this sub.   


All the answers were there, and that were not something I liked. They were bitter, they were cold. Every ounce of my existence want to reject them. My whole worldview was shattering right in front of me. I am furious. I've been lied my whole life. I am angry towards women, I am angry towards the people whom I considered friends. I am angry towards the people who never told me that if I made some improvements I could change outcomes. I used to be angry towards the people who treat me badly. And now Im even more angry at the people who told me Im nice and perfect and every other guy should be like me. They reinforced my personality that lead me towards killing myself.  


In a way I killed myself. People are telling me that I used to be good. They can't fathom that not only I'm doing good but eventually I will be doing better than me. They are insecure because of me. Those people are guilting me. And Im enjoying them seeing getting disappointed. The new people in life respects me, they think I've always been like that. I respect myself, and people respect me.   


Im lifting, giving my best. Other guys come to the gym to socialize. I come to sculpt my body. Im laser focused. I have purpose. I know the things i've been denied my whole life. Other people don't have this privilege. Even though I am smaller than everyone, even though outside gym no one else could tell I lift. I am proud of my hard work. In my mind I'm big, i'm strong, compared to my past self I'm infinitely better. It doesn't matter if others don't know, but I know that and it's enough.   


I get my first kiss, my first girlfriend. For the first time in my life a girl is interested in me and i'm not chasing. Finally my existence feel validated, finally things are working for me and not against me.    


Five years have been passed. TRP have not given some magical formula to improve life, in fact it made me realize I have to work harder than others to just have things in life that an average guy have. The only thing it gave me is the hope that you can change things.  


Just like the people who had been in this sub for years, I now lurk sometimes once in a month or two. Its the second time here i've seen a post from a same guy doing mastubratory rationalization that which is better, to fuck multiple women or one women many times.   


Before I become this old man who says that back in my time TRP had father figures and men genuinely wanted to help each other because of the pain they went through. I decided to retire from TRP instead. I have gained whatever my soul needed and the path forward is all by myself. I have to know my destiny and dictate my life all by myself.

Nobody wants another “See! Women are hypergamous, women bad!” or another lame generic platitude post. Would be immensely appreciated xoxo)** 


**Anyway, without further adieu:**



So I was studying abroad on Mount Olympus and took ""How to Speak Groot"" as an elective. This course has changed my life when interacting with people (i.e. women), and I want to share a bit of what I learned!

Read each of these sentences aloud:

I am groot.

I am groot?

I AM groot. 

I... am groot.

I. Am. Groot?

I... am... groot...

I am groot!!!

Even though each of these sentences is exactly the same, what makes them stand apart is in the tone and inflection of your voice when you speak. The emphasis on one word vs another. The slight lift in voice in the end that denotes a question vs the strong pronunciation that denotes a statement. The words are just words. How you say them changes everything.

This is why I tell people what you say is never as important as HOW you say it.

I'll give you another example. We're all familiar with Joey's (FRIENDS) famous pick up line:

""How *you* doin?""

The reason it makes people giddy is the delivery. It's the inflection on ""you"" and the subtle drop with the ""doin"" that grabs you.

It's that way he makes ""How *you* doin?"" sound like ""You are beautiful. You are sexy. You are fascinating. I WANT YOU.""

It's all in the delivery.

How this affects your interaction with women (and why confidence is so important), is because when you learn how to adjust the way you say things, you can say anything, but convey a different meaning the way you say it.

You can say ""Good Morning"" in a way that makes her *hear* ""Damn! You're sexy as fuck!"" 

You can say ""Let's go get a drink."" and what she *hears* is ""I want to take your panties off with my teeth!""

And the best part: When you learn to play with your delivery, she will ""hear"" what she wants to hear! And while this can often be a doubled-edged sword, if she's attracted to you, it will ALWAYS work out in your favor.

Now, here's how you can make this work for you:

Read the following sentences silently.

I think you're beautiful.

I think you're intelligent.

Wow, you're really funny.

I think you're sexy.

I want to fuck you. 

You want me!

Want to have sex?

Now read each sentence again, but this time say ""I am groot"". Say it in a way that tries to convey the meaning of the sentence.

You'll notice the subtle changes in diction and inflection, not only as you speak them, but as you *hear* them as well.


Now do it all again, but this time... smile while you speak.


This... this right here... this is Flirting 101. It's how to say or do one thing, but convey a completely different meaning.

It's the subtle difference in voice tone and body language that gives what ever comes out of your mouth ""context"".

307,If she's doing this then you've screwed up,264,q92wb8,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/q92wb8/if_shes_doing_this_then_youve_screwed_up/,91,"Now that I've got your attention, humor me and give me a few more moments of your time.

Don't worry. You'll get something from this. I promise.

Afterwards, you can go back to reading 10,000 word essays regarding how to swipe right on Tinder, tri-weekly posts from certain redditors, or a 19 year old giving profound life advice.

Unfortunately, that shit's not going anywhere.

So, a bit of context. I've been on this forum for just shy of 5 years. Not even sure how I came about it to be honest, just looking to rebuild myself after a divorce and ended up here. 

Really glad that I did. Learned a lot. Most of it was from the side bar and the contributions of the more senior members. There's some solid talent in here but as time's passing and restrictions are growing, there's a lot of talent leaving and not being replaced.

That just sucks because over time, I've seen people write amazing field report and solid tips to people pitching monogamy as the ultimate red pill, being worried about women's sexual satisfaction, or if it's dishonest to wear boots to appear taller.

While some of this shit is funny as hell, it's also concerning since I'd like for men to be men again. Each man that learns and grows passes it along. 

So, here's my piece of advice for you.

If you're new to this sub or the TRP ideology, try to disprove everything on the side bar. That will open your eyes to TRP truths.

If you're not new but are struggling with some facet of TRP, I would implore you to get off your phone/ass and start to go out and create an interaction. Re-reading is just escapism and fantasy building. Nothing trumps experience. 

If you're solid in life, try to help another man out. See if you can take a younger guy under your wing and teach him your ways. That's in person. Not over the internet.

The final Rule of Fight Club is that you have to fight. That means get off your ass and do something. There's only so much 'theory' that you can get. 

Now, for something of value. Feel free to use this trick.

Next time you have a woman over to your place,  toss her a marker and have her write on your wall (or buy a board if you're renting) and have her write a cute message and sign it.  Repeat with each person that comes over.  Younger women love that shit and she'll be bombarded with dread and social proof.  Don't apologize, rationalize it, or justify it.

Bonus tip: If you're struggling with approach anxiety drive up to a part of the city/town that you haven't frequented before, go into the bar, scan for where the most attractive women are, walk up to the bartender and strike up a conversation. Have a drink (doesn't have to be alcoholic) and try to befriend that bartender. Make it your mission to approach ONE attractive women and make conversation. You don't need to get laid and if you get rejected don't fret. Who cares? Repeat for 3 bars then head home.

This is a great way to build up a thick skin, become witty and start to become naturally flirtatious. You'll stumble but you'll get the hang of it. It also helps you determine how objectively attractive you are since if she's into you, she'll let you fuck up openers and jokes.

If anyone wants to add (from experience) what's worked for you regarding pick up, sex, frame control, building a personality, retaining or developing masculinity, or a personal story from trying/acting out the side bar. Share your story, man.

If this gains traction, I may see about doing this sort of thing more regularly, if not then I'm sure there's going to be a quality post any day now.",1634350876.0
308,If You Hate Women…,72,q92bmu,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/q92bmu/if_you_hate_women/,46,"Back in early 2018, someone asked me on a forum how I managed to cure my hatred and anger towards women. Here’s a copy-paste of my response at the time:

&#x200B;

\---

I didn’t actually try to cure it. If anything, I tried really hard to keep my “Women are evil” mindset. I used to read negative stuff daily, I’d constantly tell myself “Remember, this is a war, you’re always at war with all women, they all want to use you so don’t let them win”. I surrounded myself with as much “women suck” stuff as I could – used to subscribe to a tonne of anti-women, anti-feminist Youtube channels too.

I haven’t shagged a lot of girls from cold approach – only 8 so far (as of 2018). But 3 of them were virgins & another had only been with 1 guy before me. Those 4 girls were REALLY into me, and really innocent, and didn’t play ANY games whatsoever. They appreciated my time. All 4 of them cared deeply about me, 2 of them definitely loved me and the other 2 were pretty close to being in love with me.

Those 4 girls more than anything else made me realise yeah, some girls are evil – so are some guys. But some girls are pretty fucking sweet and have no intention of trying to fuck you over. Some girls are actually good people.

All the approaches I did (done over 600 so far) helped too. All the times I had a fun conversation with a cute girl really made me like women again.

I didn’t WANT to stop hating women, but it just kinda happened by accident. I’ve read a tonne of other reports on here from guys who say the same shit – they started off hating women, but by talking to and shagging a few women, they dropped the “women are evil” shit almost by accident.

So bottom line: If you’re fucking angry at women, embrace it. It’s fine man, it’s part of the process. Don’t try to fix it, just focus on having fun, shag a lot of girls, and in time you might find yourself surprised at how you just don’t care about their annoying habits (like flaking, lol)…

&#x200B;

\---

That’s right; I actively wanted to hate women and actively FOUGHT to keep up my anger towards them… But in the end women won me over and melted my cold heart with their genuine sweetness and caring nature.

If you hate women or hold a lot of anger/resentment towards “female nature”, try not to get too frustrated by that – in a lot of guys’ cases the anger/bitterness is just part of the process. Just keep on trucking, keep going on dates and trying to get laid, keep improving yourself so you get a better class of women (and more of them).

Most of all, try to keep an open mind - I talk a lot more on that [here](https://killyourinnerloser.com/always-keep-an-open-mind/). After enough times you’ll start to find ones who are pretty good people and treat you pretty damn well.

The issue will be if you never grow out of your hatred of women – or it gets worse over time. Hating (or being angry at) half the world’s population obviously isn’t going to lead to a very happy life. It’s a hell of a burden to bear.

But for now don’t worry about the future – just focus on giving yourself as much dating/sexual experience as you can, and trust that over time as you meet a few cool chicks you’ll learn to chill out with the anger/disappointment thing. Try not to be too much of a dick to girls in the mean time; they’re honestly really nice people.

What ended up happening was I would give up and move on to something else and repeat this ridiculous habit.  As I got older, I started caring a lot  less about things that don't really matter.  I stopped trying to be perfect and just focused on understanding the concept of things.

# You Don't Need A High Lay Count To Be Good With Women

Some of you  may think you need to sleep with 100 women who look like models in one year to feel good about yourself.  You'll do the math and say,

""If I approach X amount of women for X amount of days, I will reach my goal.""

When you do this, you turn something fun like interacting with beautiful women into a chore.  I learned that fucking one woman consistently gives you better results than fucking new women on a daily basis.

New pussy is good, but when you fuck one woman on a regular basis, your sex skills improve.  When you get familiar with a specific woman's body, you lower your performance anxiety.  After you fuck one woman really well, it gives you the confidence you need when you get with the next woman.  You fuck her really well it gives you the confidence you need with the next woman.  Before you know it, you'll start to understand that it's better to fuck 1 woman 100 times than fuck 100 women 1 time.

""What are you talking about?  New pussy is the best pussy""

I'm not arguing with you there, but new pussy can be more time-consuming to procure.  You may need to go on a few dates first.  You may be nervous because you want to make a good impression to solidify the lay.  If you've been fucking a woman for a few months, and you are giving it to her good, you don't need to take her on a date.  You don't need to try to impress her... you already did numerous times.  All you do is call her up and she is ready to rock and roll as soon as she enters the doorway.

# Physical Fitness Is All About Listening To Your Body

Some of you are struggling to get your physique in order and think you need to workout til you puke to get the results you want.  I've learned that when you workout, you  need to work with your body so it can work with you.  This means focus on the habit before you focus on getting ripped.  Working out with light weights for 10 minutes a day is a good start.  Then you can work on lifting heavier weights about an hour for 2-3 days a week.  Your body needs to know that you have it's best interest.  Your body needs to send motivational messages to your brain that working out feels good and it looks forward to the next workout.  This means if you feel shitty and weak, and don't feel like working out, instead of skipping a day, do a bullshit workout.

""What kind of advice is that?""

If you're starting out getting your body right, you want to keep up the habit for a lifetime.  If you have a few weeks of a shitty workout at a time, out of a lifetime, but you're never skipping days, that's a fair trade if you ask me.

""Elaborate""

Okay, let's say you wake up and feel like hammered shit to get your morning workout in.  Instead of lifting your regular heavy set (or go for a personal record), drop the weight drastically and do a few high rep sets that will only take 10-15 minutes to complete.  This send the message to your body that you're not forcing it to do something it doesn't want to do.  When your body understands this and feels good for the next workout, you may hit a PR the next workout.

Take your time when you workout.  Don't try to rush to your next set because you may be too weak to get a good set in.  As you get stronger, you may notice that your rest periods get shorter.

# The Older You Get, The Wiser And More Attractive You Can Become

There are men with grey in their beard and chiseled physiques that have women who are 20-40 years younger than them who want to fuck them.  Daniel Craig is 53 years old, and in his latest (and last) James Bond movie he looked like he's been hitting the weight room for his last role.  Michael Jai White (played as Black Dynamite a few years back) is also 53 years old and knows many styles of martial arts.  I say this because some of you have probably saw your fathers in their 50s and 60s thinking that your life is over at this age (old-looking, not dead), but for some men this is when they reach sex symbol status.

All of your favorite Marvel superhero actors are in their late 30s/ early 40s or even in their 50s.  You always hear about women swooning over Jason Mamoa and The Rock.  Jason Mamoa is 42 and The Rock is pushing 50.

If you are in your 20s or 30s, if you've been working out and eating right over a 10-20 year period, you're gonna notice a major difference in how women interact with you.  You're gonna say to yourself one day, 

""Holy shit!  I'm a sex symbol""

Some of you may think I'm bullshitting, but when you were a kid, you thought that lifting a full milk jug was a huge accomplishment.  You thought a cute girl giving you a hug was a huge accomplishment.  Working on yourself consistently over a lifetime  will show you how long you've come and also you have a ways to go.

When *you spend time with someone,* you enter their frame. 

When *someone spends time with you,* they enter your frame. 

If your internal frame differs from their internal frame / external exertion of their frame, you will have a battle of frames. 

If your frame is weaker you will coalesce and do what they want to do 

If their frame is weaker you will be able to lead them into your world.

If both your frames are strong, you will stop hanging out and go do your own things.

It is possible for two strong frames to exist simultaneously and remain unable to crack the other.

Real World Examples -

With women, if you go to the gym but your girl is fat, and you get fat because you spend time with her, that means your frame is weaker than hers, as you entered into her world of being a fat ass. 

If you are fit and your girl isn't fit but after spending time with you she developed that round gym bunny ass its because she stepped into your world (entered your frame of life) and you lead her to a better path. 

If you are fit but live with a fat junk food roommate, and you remain fit and he remains fat, both your frames are strong and you won't be able to influence each other. You might eat pizza with him every 3 weeks and he might fuck around in the gym with you sometimes but in the end, neither of you conceded frame.",1634099263.0

Women are now 59.5% of undergrads to 40.5% for men.  That’s fast approaching “Surf City” numbers – [two girls for every boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkbOkVHEIf0).  And the diminishing number of men in higher education is a problem for who?  

Women, of course.  

Who will women marry?  There won’t be enough high-~~value~~ status men for women to MARRY!!!  NO FAIR!!!  

Incidentally, the percentage of women at uni is now *greater* than the percentage of men at uni in 1970, which led to the creation of Title IX.  Will there now be a “Title IX” for men?  Don’t count on it.  Why?  The girls will cry foul!  **Because when you are used to preferential treatment, equal treatment feels like discrimination.**  

Professor Galloway does hit on the problem, probably without recognizing it.  

Spoiler Alert: It’s Hypergamy.

**""We have mating inequality in the country,"" he said, adding that women with college degrees don't want to partner with men who don't hold a degree.** 

So women look down on blue collar men, and that’s the MEN’S fault, ofc.  Not that women should adjust to the new reality.  

So what’s going on?  College costs $$$$ now, with no guaranty of a comfortable, upper middle class lifestyle at the end of the rainbow.  For most folks, though, there *WILL* be a lot of *DEBT*.  The kind you cannot escape from *via* bankruptcy.  

And what is that degree that ends in “Studies” worth?  As I wrote about in CorporateLand, when I sat on the hiring committee, a degree that ends in “Studies” would, with rare exception, earn you a ‘ding’ from me.  So you wind up with a degree in “Insect Masturbation Studies” or “Weirdo Interpretive Dance” and $350K in debt.  

Sure, if you’re going to be a doctor or a lawyer (and think this over, carefully; it’s not like it used to be), you need a degree and then grad school.  Too many dudes treat college like it’s some sort of adult sleep away camp where they drink beer, smoke weed, play Xbox and maybe get a degree.  Those dudes need to be doing something else.

Unless I had a kid who was a mega-star brainiac, we’d be talking options aside from uni.  And if I had a kid who wanted to be “undeclared” or wanted some weird-ass, useless degree, then they’d be double majoring (or getting a joint degree) in something that they picked and something that I picked.

**Takeaways**

-Don’t waste money on useless shit.

-Avoid going into debt unless you have a clear path to prosperity.  


-If you are a young man at Uni, you could/should be *KILLING* it, socially and sexually.

-Find your grind, and get after your grind.  Women should never be the goal, only a pleasant accompaniment to a well-lived life.",1633978240.0

(see my comment on this post to see that post)

Since then, I implemented a lot of the advice that you guys told me. Lost weight (45lbs), got in shape, wore better clothes, started talking to girls and so on.Here's a before and after:[https://imgur.com/a/kdoUbbo](https://imgur.com/a/kdoUbbo)

From the last 1 year my college was closed, so I came back a month ago and today I finally hooked up with a chick after making out with her 3-4 times. She has a boyfriend who's not in college right now and in her words, she wanted to fuck me because 'I became too hot' for her xD

I also tried online dating 2 months ago for like a week and got  [50+](https://imgur.com/L3dYLtg)  matches (from Bumble + Tinder). Didn't go on any dates because I didn't have the balls to but still, it boosted my confidence a lot.

This might not be very impressive for you guys but you gotta start somewhere! So here are my tips for other guys who might be virgins/totally unexperienced with women:

1. **Lift**

[These](https://imgur.com/a/br4OI78) are some before and afters. The left ones are after 2-3 months of dieting and no workout (I lost \~ 10kgs) and the right ones are 3-4 months after working out. I know they're not super impressive but again, what matters is that they are better than the befores.

Lifting is the sole reason why I was able to fuck a chick today and why I got some matches on online apps (I remember I got close to 2-3 when I was a fat fuck).

Look, lifting is one of those few rare areas in your life which will 100% give you results if you put in the work. You might work your ass off for an exam but still there are decent chances that the odds wont be in your favour but in case of lifting, if you put in the work, you body **will** improve, period. The confidence you get after someone says ""Dude you've lost some weight right?"", ""Dude recommend a plan for me too"" or when some chick says ""I like your body, you're hot"" is unparalleled.

2) **Up your fashion and instagram game**

[This](https://imgur.com/a/hcjHH1H) is the difference between the posts I used to post on Instagram before and after I was decently fit. Just use better pics guys. You'll thank me later.

3) **Just tell chicks you find them cute and you wanna hang out**

I read this online. The power of this simple statement is enormous. I went on some dates with girls in college I NEVER thought I had any chance with. I just tried to talk to them in a friendly way initially and then without talking much, i just said ""so listen i think you're pretty cool so lets grab a drink sometime"" and boom. If she rejects you, atleast you didn't waste your time on her.

4) **Wear shoe lifts if you're short**

I'm a short guy (5'7). Now a days, I usually always wear shoe lifts (3 inch min and 4inchs optimal). You won't believe a girl I was talking to a few weeks back (she's 5'2) was telling me that I was way too tall for her and that's the first time in my life I didn't feel short. So if chicks can wear all sorts of makeup, we guys can atleast wear some shoe lifts that make us look taller. They're absolutely worth the investment. They might be uncomfortable at first but you will get used to them pretty quick.

That's about it guys. You can change your life around in a span of a few months!

And of course, I want to thank this subreddit. I wouldn't have done it if I didn't write the post at the top. Thank you!",1633806356.0
313,Frame = Values,54,q50k9w,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/q50k9w/frame_values/,24,"You’re curious about frame, read one blog post on the subject but still don’t have it down, eh?

My guide to frame.

Note: I’ll be using frame and value interchangeably.

Frame is another way of saying “value.”

A value is a moral. A message. The value of friendship, the value of intelligence, the value of love. Etc. It’s a filter for how we color the world. 

What values are you crafting your argument around? What values are you living your life by? What values are at your core?

For example I’m writing this post with an “observational” frame/value.

You’re reading this from a “learning” frame/value, or perhaps a “critiquing” value, if I didn’t hold true to that aforementioned value of “observation” well enough.

There is no inherently bad frame, just like there is no inherently bad value. It’s about your reasoning as to why a specific value works best in a specific circumstance, not about whether the value itself is good/bad. 

That’s called an argument.

Ex:

Most liberals try to solve problems from a “fairness” frame. They believe the best way to solve problems is through the use of the “value” called “fairness.” There’s nothing inherently wrong with the value of fairness, it’s a trait that’s had a positive impact on our evolution. It’s about whether fairness is best to solve a specific problem in a specific circumstance.

Most libertarians try to solve problems through the “individual liberty” frame. Again nothing inherently wrong with that value. Without individual liberty we’re slaves. 

Most conservatives try to solve problems trough the “tradition” frame. Again nothing wrong with that value. Traditions have worked for thousands of years for a reason.

Know that:

1.	⁠Specific values beat general values in the battle of frames.

Ex: The first and most general value to take is whether or not existence is a good thing. Every single other value stems from the answer of “Yes, Life is good,” or “No, Life isn’t good.”

The question is to determine positive and negative values.

Why is life good? Because (Inset more specific positive value here, ex: love)

Why is life bad? Because (Inset more specific positive value here, ex: thing I dislike)

It’s also a way to derive us vs. them but I digress.

2. Everyone has a set of core values.

This is who you are in your soul. It is necessary for everyone to have different core values for the same reason genetic mutation is a thing. It’s helped our species evolve over time. There is nothing wrong with your core values.

Politics stem from our core values. If you believe the value of equality is best to solve problems, you’re going to elect politicians who will use the value of equality in their policy to solve problems.

By appealing to someone’s core values you are selling to them; you can look at any sales related field - those that sell the best are those who best understand the values of others (empathy) and how to help them achieve that value through a product.

3. You can hold multiple values, as long as they don’t conflict with one another.

The value of “individualism” is not compatible with the value of “collectivism” because they, by definition, strive to do two different things. They cannot co-exist at the same time. Neither are bad. But you can’t hold them at the same time.

The values of “individualism” and “freedom” can co-exist at the same time, because they are, by definition, not opposed.

4. Reframing arguments.

All arguments are, is a battle of values. Who can argue for a value more strongly?

All “reframes” are, is switching the specific value that you’re arguing for “liberty” to a similar value ex: “freedom” (as long as the two values can co-exist). To support a more generalized value ex: “competition.”

The second value should co-exist with the first (see point #3)

Hopefully this helped out some, its nowhere near a complete guide, but should serve as an adequate way to define frame.

315,My Thoughts on AWALT,228,q3o9l6,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/q3o9l6/my_thoughts_on_awalt/,43,"Truth time: The “dating game” really fucking sucks at the start.

When you haven’t had as much dating success as you’d like, you care so much about reaching your goals, whilst desperately trying to avoid any possible rejection. Every time a girl turns you down, it hurts, like a knife to the heart. Every little infraction a girl commits – every time she doesn’t do exactly what you want her to do – can feel like a personal assault on you, like she’s trying to crush your hopes and dreams.

Its easy to become frustrated and even disillusioned over your lack of results, especially when you’re first starting out. That frustration and desperation to just get laid can build up in a whirlwind of anger and torment that you just want to hurl at somebody else so you don’t have to keep it all inside.

As the rejections build, as your frustration grows, it’s so easy to start adding up every time a girl doesn’t give you what you want, keeping a running total of how many times you’ve been “screwed over”. It’s tempting to tell yourself, “women as a whole are all doing wrong by me.” A friend of mine, said it best.

“You blur them all together, instead of recognizing each girl isn’t responsible for the sins of the previous girl.”

I was the king of doing this. I used to take pleasure in doing what one girl had done to me, but doing it to a new girl. I had multiple people tell me, “Don’t mistreat a girl just because you were mistreated by another.” Bloody good advice.

But did I listen? Of course not – I was young, dumb, and full of cum. Me taking my frustration out on other girls only ended in me being even more frustrated – it didn’t solve any issues and in fact just made me obsess more about the negatives. As Buddha said, “Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.” I got more and more swept up in, “Every girl is deliberately trying to annoy me”. I kept count of how many times I’d been “wronged” – even including stupid things like “This girl said she has a boyfriend” or “This girl wanted to wait til date 3 before we had sex”. In my quest to find every example of a girl screwing me over I fell victim to confirmation bias.

&#x200B;

* I’d ghost girls – often for no reason – just so I could feel powerful and in control. “Other girls ghosted me, but now I get to ghost this girl. I win!” .
*  I’d intentionally wait a couple days to reply to a girl’s texts, telling myself, “Other girls have taken days to reply to my texts, so it’s fine if I do it.”
* I’d taken pleasure in rejecting a girl, giving no consideration to how she felt because, “Other girls didn’t care how I felt when they rejected me.”
* A girl would open up to me and tell me her feelings, and instead of empathising with her vulnerability, I’d robotically say, “I don’t give a damn about your feelings”. If a few girls in the past hadn’t cared about my feelings, I was justified in not caring about any girl’s feelings, right?
* If a girl didn’t give me what I wanted (her number, a kiss, sex, etc) instead of being mature and saying, “That’s fine, I can’t tell you what to do” I’d feel “wronged” by her, like she hadn’t given me what I was “owed”. I’d take out that frustration on the next girl, intentionally withholding something she wanted – so I could feel I was “back in control” & not a “victim”.

You’ve likely done some of these things yourself. Most of us have at some point.

I’d often rationalise it to myself as, “I’m just fucking with her, it’s all good” or “I’m just trying to entertain myself”. But what I was really doing was annoying or even hurting someone just because someone else had annoyed me.

It’s important to take a step back and ask yourself, “Is a girl not giving me what I want really a big deal? Should I be angry just because a girl decided not to give me her number?” I know it’s frustrating when you reaaalllyyy just want that number, and 20 girls also just rejected you & didn’t give you their number. But take a deep breath, let it go, and try not to get too frustrated. This is supposed to be fun, it’s not a life-or-death battle.

On a similar note, you have to realise that not getting your way is very much part of trying to get laid. Some people will try to sell you a rosy reality and tell you “If you just say/do the right things, you can win any girl!” The cold hard truth is: you’re going to get rejected far more than you’ll ever be successful. For every 50 girls you talk to, you may only have sex with one of them (or none of them). Rejection – and not getting your way – is very much part of the process.

You also can’t expect each individual girl to do what you want, or even to behave rationally. People (especially women) are emotional, erratic, have their own agendas and wants and needs and hopes – they’re not always going to do what you want. Sure, you’d give anything for this cute girl you’re talking to to give you her number… but sometimes (most of the time) it just won’t work out that way. Best thing you can do is move on and go hit on more girls.

The long-term cure is, as with most guys’ problems, to get laid enough that you start seeing women not as your enemy but as just other humans. You’ll come to realise women are exactly like us – sometimes with even more pain, doubt, fears, insecurities than we have. No, I’m not saying you have to be Mr White Knight, protecting all the poor women’s feelings. But you don’t have to be the opposite – acting like a raging cock just for the “lolz”.

Life’s much more pleasant when you aim to be somewhere in the middle. Showing respect to girls who earn it. Getting rid of the timewasters/girls who don’t respect you. And treating each new girl you meet as if you’re meeting her for the first time. Because you obviously are – you’ve never met this girl before, even if she’s “just another woman”. Don’t tar her with the same brush as any bad apples you’ve run into in the past.

Don’t punish the many for the actions of a few.

When you’ve slept with and dated a large number of women, you start seeing them not as a collective group, but as individuals, each with their own hopes, dreams, fears, insecurities. You know, human beings. You’ll find there’s some shit ones, some average ones, and some truly lovely ones. They’re not all copy-paste clones “running the same female firmware.

So to address the topic of “AWALT” – All Women Are Like That. Some guys use the concept to show similarities between girls – to the point where they claim there are no unique women. Supposedly all women are exactly the same and all want exactly the same thing – essentially to selfishly use men & then cast them aside once they’ve leeched them dry. Many times I’ve heard the phrases, “all women will fuck you over” and “don’t worry about how you treat a woman, because she’ll eventually leave you for an alpha anyway”.

Sure, if you’d like to live your entire life being unable to trust 50% of your fellow humans, then go for it. Hell, I used to be like this myself, years ago. I really didn’t like women; I actively distrusted them. I spent too much of my time either paranoid a woman was out to get me, or I focused my efforts on trying to “beat her” and “win” some imagined battle I was in with her.

And I really regret it. Not just because I was a douche to a tonne of women for no reason & treated them all like the enemy. But because it hurt me as well. It’s so painfully obvious I was acting out of insecurity, out of pain from all the times I’d been rejected. I had confirmation bias – I was actively looking for bad women who’d rejected me (even if they were ultra polite and kind with their rejection), and dismissing all the nice ones I met. If you asked me about the nice ones, I’d have said, “She doesn’t count, she was just pretending to be nice”. And then I’d rattle off a list of the last 20 women who’d been “crappy” to me.

Nuts. Totally nuts. Sure, I’d been rejected, ignored & hurt by some women before. But the next girl I walked up to was a fresh new girl. She hadn’t hurt me, or committed an infraction against me – she hadn’t done anything wrong. But I treated her as if she was part of some group (women) that were all trying to frustrate me or something.

If you’re in a similar boat, pause for a second. Ask yourself:

Do I want to be a person who brings positivity into the world – someone who’s a force for good? Or do I want the world to be a shittier place for having me in it?

316,The fundamental rule,48,q3nh7h,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/q3nh7h/the_fundamental_rule/,12,"A lot of new/old people on here may be scattered and confused when reading all these different ideas and philosophies. You don’t have to be.

In order to understand everything else this subreddit offers to teach you, you first have to understand the most important one: that being confidence. 

Now I know what you might be thinking. “Oh man I’ve heard this a million times before. I need different advice”. Cut that shit out right now. In order to be able to obtain female validation and attention, there’s a basic 3 step process you need to self-actualize.

The first step is a positive self-image, which starts with simple self-evaluation. By realizing where your strengths lie, you have a better understanding on what it is you need to strengthen, and what could potentially make you a “natural player” come the near future. Analyze what you are good at and work on what you aren’t. This will help you gain groundwork in your weak areas while helping you realize what it is about you that are valuable. The first step to any of this is valuing YOURSELF more than you could ever value any woman. As hard as that is to accept, you have to suck it up.

The second step is gaining control over a group/crowd. Once you have realized what it is you are good and bad at, you can start practicing your skills on crowds of people. Usually this is best done in an all male-crowd. Since many of you feel that sense of self-conscious and anxiety around females. Use the skills you learned from the first step and establish yourself amongst a crowd. This is probably the most important step of all, since it symbolizes your transition from a soy to a chad. If you want the bitch, you need dominance and charisma over a crowd. Be the guy everyone flicks to in that crowd. Do this by analyzing what behaviors attract the most amount of people, male or female. Gain a following.

And the third and final step is taking all of these past concepts and using them on a female. At this point you will have learned how to inflate your own value, as well as use it to garner attention. You’re ready for your final step; getting a bitch. I’ll only summarize here, since the rest of the subreddit should be more than enough to teach you. But when you’re at this point, you want to realize that, even if it all goes wrong and you don’t even get her number, you still have to walk out as if she is the one missing out, not you. This last step relies on all the attraction/rapport tactics you all know, so I’ll end it here.

In conclusion, it’s all about self-image. You need to stop telling yourself how bad you are, and start telling yourself how good you are. Also lift (not even remotely a requirement, but a suggestion) Thank you for listening!",1633656687.0
317,Why Men Stay In Red Pill Rage,172,q36c9z,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/q36c9z/why_men_stay_in_red_pill_rage/,128,"There are a lot of men who find the Red Pill by either YouTube or Reddit and don't understand what female nature really is.  They read or listen to men with similar misfortunes with women and they compile the problems with women instead of compiling solutions to circumvent their problems with women.

**Personal story:** *I had a girlfriend (it was actually my first) who was sweet and submissive when I first got with  her.  Over time, she turned really bitchy.  About six months later, we broke up.  When we broke up, instead of hating women, I looked within myself.  The truth is, I learned game, but abandoned it once I got a girl.  I thought you use game to get women and get rid of it once you get the girl, but in actuality, you never get rid of the game, but you get rid of the woman if you need to.  I also looked at myself and realized I was acting bitch-made with her.  After that experience, it taught me never to act that way with women ever again.*

I used the bad relationship to learn and improve instead of give me a reason to see women as a problem because they don't like me while I'm not at my best.

Men stay in Red Pill Rage because they never learn game.  It's like coming across a puzzle where a lot of people had trouble solving.  You think the puzzle is unsolvable, but there are people who figured out the puzzle and share their knowledge of how to solve the puzzle, but it requires rejecting certain perspectives and looking at new ones.  For a person to do that, it can fuck with their mental equilibrium and they would rather not learn how to solve the puzzle than change their perspective.

Something I like doing with my posts are interact with people who write comments.  They will argue me down saying that a lot of the stuff I'm saying is wrong because  of some study they heard about from a content creator without looking at the study themselves or actually have an experience from a new perspective.  Jamaica is a beautiful place to take a vacation, but a lot of people stay in resorts and on the beach.  If they went to the struggle side of Jamaica, they would think people are lying about Jamaica being beautiful.

If you take an interest in women, they become like a Jamaica.  If you have no game and don't want to learn game but complain about how evil and manipulative women are, you'll be like the people looking at the struggle side of Jamaica.  When you learn game and get women to submit to you and genuinely like and are attracted to you, it's like taking a vacation at a Jamaican resort.

For every man who is good with women, most of them are not the best-looking, don't have a lot of status, and just make enough money to make ends meet.  However, these men understand women and know how to control the situation.  They know the game is not about getting ""the girl"" but having the power to get women.  Your average man who consumes Red Pill content wants women to fit their Blue pill, Disney fantasy.  Men with game take the woman for who she is and deals with her accordingly or charges her to the game (dumps her or stop interacting with her).  Men with game treat it like a sport.  When these men get money and status, they don't use it to get women, but they let their money and status improve their personal lives and getting women is just a by-product of that.  They understand that if a woman likes them for their status and money, she doesn't truly like him and he may have sex with her, but not get too emotionally invested in her.

318,Escaping The Pleasure Palace,249,q2ljmf,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/q2ljmf/escaping_the_pleasure_palace/,97,"October is here which means it's time for everyone to last minute get in shape for their Halloween party! Married Fat Dad Pill has to figure out how to get in shape without disrupting the goofy beer dad lifestyle. Feminists are doing their best to make Western women even more sterile and undateable. Self Help Motivation Sphere is gonna say some shit about one percent improvement everyday or whatever. Everybody wants to make a better horse carriage. But nobody wants to make the car. In other words, everybody wants to play within their rules. Nobody wants a Red Pill.

A Red Pill is a radical rejection of the system. In fact we're so good at rejecting the system, that the system went out of their way to try to de-radicalize us. First there was the Good Man Project. Then they deployed the term Toxic Masculinity to shame us. When that didn't work they set up a quarantine. Now if you want to read a GaylubeOil masterpiece you have to click through a warning that says something to the effect of: Are you sure you want to hang out with Toxic Bad Boys? Wouldn't you rather compliment our Gone Wild Butt Sluts or discuss video games?

The whole thing has an infantilizing maternal quality to it. Reddit Mommy knows best, because you're her little boy. If anyone finds out that you're a Red Pill Bad Boy they're gonna tell Reddit Mommy, or Twitter Mommy, or YouTube Mommy or any number of other technocratic Robo Mommies. What if your no one's little boy, but your own man? When did you agree to abide by Mommy Morality?

The problem is that the logos of matriarchy is the logos of castration. When anything is sublimated to female logic it becomes stagnant, boring, rule bound and standardized. Let's run through some examples. The more women participate in a conversation the less original it is. Ocasio Cortez is pedaling a flat middle school socialism because she's duller and less outgoing then [Fidel Castro](https://youtu.be/hiSfK5QrlMo). Hollywood is in an uncreative dark age ever since it replaced their [Jew perverts](https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/scale_crop_768_433/2018/01/louis_c.k._and_harvey_weinstein_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2018.jpg) with fat unqualified women. The University has been stripped of controversial discourse and vigour. Why? Because [female intelligence is clustered around the mean](https://youtu.be/DK6rqm2nCzM) and women prefer stability to discovery. Women are the harbingers of “stagnant productivity”, busy work which ultimately results in nothing.

This is the environment that modern men grew up in and spend the majority of their time: a mommy approved daycare where everyone and their feelings are safe. The external environment of the modern man is mirrored in his internal environment. Internally the modern man is a permanent child. The modern man doesn't want to fight compete or struggle. He wants to have fun. He castrates himself so he can stay in mommy daycare forever and never have to endure the hardships of masculinity.

The modern man is in a state of passive stupor, obsessive pleasure seeking, impotence, and depression. He's a child who's been left at the daycare too long. He's bored of playing but doesn't know how or have the drive to do anything else. He wants to climb out of the pleasure pit but he also wants to pleasure himself while he does it. That why AskTRP is on the constant lookout for *fun* ways to be alpha. Fun alpha movies, fun alpha pick up lines and books but only if they are fun easy to comprehend and alpha! This hedonic dysphoria is a prison without walls because it's self imposed.

The only way out of Mommy Daycare FunZone is to consciously reject it. Maybe start by telling yourself that you're a grown ass man who doesn't need to be having fun all the time. A lot of possibilities become available when you don't spend hours smiling at a fluorescent screen. Life is a struggle in which man must win himself a worthy place in the world, whether physically, intellectually or artistically. Ultimately you have two choices. You can either jerk off to the lives of others, never having lived your own. Or be a toxic Red Pill bad boy and live your own life outside Mommy Daycare FunZone.

319,"Field report - From incel/mgtow for 2 years to two regular plates, within the space of 2 weeks. Spurred on by Nofap",229,pzvlrx,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pzvlrx/field_report_from_incelmgtow_for_2_years_to_two/,108,"This post may help lurkers that are getting no pussy. I was there.

I got no pussy for over 2 years (30 yoa). My dating success before this enormous dry spell was moderate. I got some hot girls in my younger years, and some decent looking girls and some average ones. Mostly short, casual type monogamous relationships that I fell into, and ONSs. Fairly high n-count but not ridiculous. 

My time as an incel/mgtow was mainly due to laziness, a lack of proactivity and my quiet social life, as well as living in a small town (35,000). I didn’t use the dating apps for a large part of this time and rarely go out anymore. I am out of shape (working on it) and didn’t believe I could get the level of girl I deserved (standards set by my previous, fitter self). So I contented myself to porn. 

I was mostly happy enough getting no pussy, but it was occasionally a nagging hole in my life. Let’s say I could have been happier being single.

After having enough, I made a commitment that the next time I came, it would be on or in a female. This mindset changed everything. A sense of motivation came over me, spurred on by my horniness, and I started talking to girls in the street, and the average girls I was matching on tinder started seeming a whole lot more appealing. And this is the first step if you are getting no pussy - don’t be picky. Trust me, busting a nut in a fat chick is better than on your keyboard. Once you are getting regular sex with average chicks, you can upgrade with a sense of confidence present. As someone that’s getting regular action, you’re more likely to be successful in upgrading due to your abundance.

After about 2 weeks of Nofap, I matched with a girl on tinder and met her for a coffee. The date was uneventful but not bad. I said I’d see her again later in the week. I organised for her to come straight over at 8pm, she knew what was up. We dirty texted before the date (I know the text rule but don’t think it’s applicable all the time) and I told her to come with no panties in a skirt. She did, and I fucked her twice. She’s 24 so I was into it. I’m seeing her again tomorrow night. Again no date just her coming over - low investment.

That same week a second tinder girl, had another coffee date but escalated to kiss and invited her over same night. We fucked. She just left my house again tonight after a cooking sesh and second sex sesh - low investment again.

Lesson learnt from these two girls - girls on tinder are chasing sex as much as guys. They know it’s a casual dating site so basically do what you want and most probably they will be down.

If you are lurking here and getting no pussy, try not to complicate it. This is a simple formula that has turned my success around:

1. Stop watching porn and pulling your dick. Make the commitment that the next time you come will be with a woman.
2. Meet your tinder matches, even if they aren’t that hot - step one will help with this. At the same time approach girls and talk to them. Grease your wheels and maybe get a few numbers.
3. Set up a simple first date and go for the kiss if it’s right. 
4. Invite her over for a “drink” sometime after that. If you’re in a city, could be a nearby bar, then shift to home. Inviting her straight over communicates sex obviously.
5. Turn that into a repeat casual sexual relationship.
6. Upgrade and replace or gain more plates.

It’s easy to complicate getting pussy, but it really is simple. Filling your head with too much information can fuck you, especially if you are already a nervous kind of guy. Just make clear, simple logistical plans in your head and stick to them. My success rate for the first two dates I’ve had for more than 2 years is 100% and they are now both repeat customers. If I can do that anyone can.",1633182922.0
320,Why you NEED a second passport - on the complacency of the modern man and what lies ahead,197,pzl4zr,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pzl4zr/why_you_need_a_second_passport_on_the_complacency/,177,"Regardless of your ideological position, there is a storm brewing in the first world countries. western ideology has been tainted by soulless consumerism - and blind complacency of a status quo that leans increasingly pathological with every passing day. Your grandfather's generation did not need the Redpill - they were taught it firsthand by their fathers - but the wisdom of the elders has been drowned by the mindless cacophony of ideological gluttony and decadence.

&nbsp;

**This is fixable** - Some may say this all part of a greater plan by a group of ""Shadow Elites™"" but the reality is the reason is irrelevant to the individual toiling inside of the system designed to reduce him into a cattle. 20% of his earnings going to his ""All new 2021 Hyundai Elantra"", 20% going to his student loans for his degree in ""Liberal studies"" & 20% going to his ex-wife so she can live for free in a house with her new boyfriend. The reality is simple - this system is no longer one that exists to serve you. This system wants to exploit you of your labor and discard you. You are allowed to speak out against the system, but only if you direct your anger towards the approved sources - truly dissident speech is always punished. 

&nbsp;

**Not all cultures are like this** - there are many places in the world that you can live free of the mental masturbation of virtue-signalling cows. You can live in a culture where the women behave like women - & the men behave like men. You can live in a culture that aligns with your values. Why live in a place where you are hated simply for existing? Why live in a place where you are demonized for the sins of people you have never met? Why live in a place where you need a 300-page guidebook and 160 hours of Youtube ""PUA"" to simply bring a 4/10 hambeast to your cockroach infested 1-bedroom apartment in the shit side of town? The answer is simple - culture.

&nbsp;

**What culture is best for you and your future family is a deeply personal decision that should not be taken lightly.** Some may prefer the order and security of a Japan, while others prefer the absolute freedom of a South American or Central American destination. Every country has beautiful and ugly women (Trust me, I know), I wouldn't recommend choosing a country based around an ethnic fetish - but rather based upon the cultural values that you see fit for raising a family and passing on.

&nbsp;

**I cannot stress enough the URGENCY in this process,** look at the social revolution happening in the United States of America - think of all the things you used to be able to say and do that are now completely prohibited in the culture. Look at Australia - the police are brutally assaulting thousands of citizens for simply demanding their freedoms. The first world is at a precipice of a very dark and volatile time. Remember that landlord that raised your rent 300$? Inflation is coming. It is perceptible in sexual strategy as well - The 80/20 Rule becomes ESPECIALLY important for women in times of impending political instability - whether they know it or not. 80/20 has historically been most poignant in times of cultural turmoil - almost like they can sense it like animals sense storms.

&nbsp;

**You can sense it too, You've been feeling it for a few years now** - political angst, uncertainty - disgust in our current cultural velocity. If you are a citizen of a first world country without at least a secondary residence inside of a cheap - nondescript third world destination - you are simply a sitting duck for the coming times. No amount of Ammo-hoarding - MRE prepping - canned food stacking will be able to protect you if you are immobile in a combat zone.

&nbsp;

**I instead paint for you an alternate picture** - you wake up in the morning alongside a beautiful woman - stress free - knowing she can NEVER collect alimony or child-support from you if she tries to trap you with Jamal's kid. You step outside to your beautiful balcony that's half the price of your NYC roach-trap bachelor pad - and look out over the ocean. A serene calm washes over you, you know that Joe Biden, Justin Trudeau, Angela Merkle, and the Crocodile Hunter can't touch you. You are a free man. You turn on the news for a brief chuckle - the ridiculous actions of your countrymen that once appalled you are now light amusement - they are no longer your people, you are no longer influenced by them. You sip your morning coffee and enjoy the breakfast your woman cooks for you as you think to yourself ""This is so much healthier than the SLOP I was served in my home country"". You are spending 1/3rd of what you used to spend to live. You turn on your computer and fire up your remote job - you dial down the volume as some obese American HR woman cackles into her microphone about some superficial notion of equality - the meeting is finished, you turn on your automatic mouse mover to make your status appear available as you go for your afternoon walk by the ocean. The work day is finished after only 2 hours of work! You laugh as you remember the American Stacy that rejected you to go blow that Basketball player in a bathroom - as you laugh - a cute girl smiles at you as you walk by. You whistle - a cultural norm in your new culture since men are allowed to be men where you now live. You keep walking until you grab a lemonade - It's much less sweet here - but no matter. You return home and lift in your private gym, have your sex, and you sleep. **Your life is simpler now - you have more freedoms both individually and financially.**

&nbsp;

AF/BB and AWALT will still always apply no matter where in the world you go, but the ridiculous antics of western women are laughable in comparison to the elegant femininity of the women in your new home. You know that if or when you impregnate one - she will make a respectable and honorable mother to your children. You feel physically lighter free of the chains of western decadence and degeneracy.

&nbsp;

If you make this jump - you will be criticized by your former countrymen - you will be called a traitor for what they consider ""Running away from the problem"". To counter their argument - I offer this as a rebuttal - What were you going to do anyways? Go to one poorly organized protest and then go home? Those who criticize you are too cowardly to fix the problem - and instead whine about it. They balk at the corruption of the first world but lack the gall to organize - they are the soft herds of beta male followers who balk angrily at anomalies without offering any solution other than trust in a nonexistent plan. Secretly they envy you. They will say you left because you couldn't get women in your home country. Before you let their judgement affect you - look at their life and the quality of their women. I rest my case.

&nbsp;

**The choice is yours - I know the phrase ""Enjoy the decline"" get's thrown around a lot here - but once it declines to a certain point it will quickly stop being enjoyable.**

321,Strong Game Scares Weak Men--Do You Want To Remain A Beta Because Becoming An Alpha Scares You?,181,pyh99g,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pyh99g/strong_game_scares_weak_mendo_you_want_to_remain/,43,"I've written many posts on this subreddit and some of the comments I've gotten lets me know that there are some men who want women to accept betas and treat them like Alphas.  And there are others who are Alphas (or aspiring Alphas) and want to learn the game.

Some of you think that women are damaged goods beyond repair and the reason for that is because you're operating from a Beta Bucks standpoint or, as Rom Wills calls it, non-select standpoint.

Men who learn game and understand that women want to fuck one type of man, while settling with a different type of man, you will actually find joy in being with women when you're the guy they're fucking.

For men who practice BDSM, they learned how to dominate women, but at the same type, let the woman know that they care about her in some kind of way.  I was listening to a BDSM podcast on Audible and the podcast speaker mentioned something that they do called ""after care"" after they were done ""playing"".  What I mean is after he has whipped her, spanked her, or whatever they were doing, the Dom would make sure that his sub was good mentally and even gives her a massage, aspirin, probably give her some rubbing alcohol or bandages if blood was drawn, etc.  When the sub understands that her Dom is dominant, yet caring, she will trust him even more to take things even further.  The Dom must get his sub's consent if he is to do anything to her (I understand Doms and subs are not gender-specific, but I'm aiming this post at men who want to know the Male Dom/Female sub dynamic).  The Dom must make sure that he respect his sub's wishes when she wants him to stop, slow down, or is okay to keep going.

For men who learn game from players, macks, and pimps, they learned that it's about the man, not the woman. Yes, these men understand female nature, but they learn it to gain an advantage, not see the disadvantages of being with women.  You see, these men were ""Red Pilled"" before it was even a thing.  They understand female nature and they understand that women must deal with you from a place of respect.  If a woman or a big group of women are disrespectful towards them, they will not consider her an option.  If they're with her, they will ""charge her to the game"" (dump her, stop dealing with her, etc).

Some of you may notice that my posts don't sound ""Red Pill"" but that's because I learn game from other avenues.  As a matter of fact, the first place I learned game was from a book called The Art Of Mackin' by Tariq Nasheed.  Some of you may know him for his socio-political works and documentaries, but he wrote relationship books.  That book came out before the Red Pill was even a thing back in the late 90s/early 2000s.  I also consumed content on pimps and pick up artists.  It's not limited to that either.  I learned game from NoFap or Semen retention.  I heard about the Red Pill later on (probably about 4-5 years ago) from Donovan Sharp and he talked about the book The Rational Male.  

You see, Red Pill is not the only thing out there that helps you understand female nature.  As a matter of fact, there are men who learn the Red Pill and get better with women without going into Red Pill Rage because they had their hearts broken years ago.  They learn the Alpha Fuck/Beta Bucks dynamic and learn towards the Alpha fucks side of the game more to enjoy all the sexual benefits from women, while keeping their ""bucks"" in their wallets.  Other men want to remain Betas and get angry because women want to settle with them after the Alphas have had their fun with her.

You want to be the guy that women think of when they're married with children and remembering the hot steamy sex the both of you had.  You want to be the guy who women are with when they text or call their boyfriend saying that they're not gonna make it to see them.  You want to be the guy who moves towards the strong game so they can stop being weak men.

Women aren’t like that. 

I have on more than one occasion heard my mother talk to my baby mama and ask her, “Why?” 

“I love my son but why are you cooking and cleaning and sleeping with him when you know he’s out there sleeping with other women too?” 

My baby mama says the same thing. 

“Because I can.” 

Recently I was at a family get together and on one side it was my mom, her friend, and my step dad’s sister in law. 

On the other end it was me, my step dad, my mom’s friends boyfriend, and step dad’s brother. 

My mom’s friend ranted about how her 26 year old son stays at home with her, barely works, and just smokes weed all day. However his girlfriend uber eats and DoorDashes him food, drives him around, let’s him borrow her car, and buys him clothes. 

“Isn’t that just wrong?” She asked. 

All the men looked at each other and smiled. My step dad had a huge grin and said “That boy got it GOOD.” 

My mom shook her head. “We need to mentor these young girls.” 

Her friend went on to say how she tried to talk some sense into her son’s girlfriend and that made us laugh harder. 

“Oh now she’s definitely not going anywhere. She thinks that you’re tryna break them up so she’s like ‘I’m gonna show her.’” 

All in all it was a hilarious convo. All the men kept saying that her son had a good deal and there was nothing wrong. 

All the women urged the mom to wake that girl up to leave her son. 

Moral of the story - Keep your bitch on a tight leash and let her know that your mom ain’t her friend. I planted that seed into my baby mama a long time ago so she dismisses my mom’s “wake up” sermon.",1632875392.0
323,The Importance of Killing Your Fear,276,pxcdw6,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pxcdw6/the_importance_of_killing_your_fear/,43,"**The Importance of Killing Your Fear**


Sometimes we talk about Frame and sometimes about killing your own ego (which is important, but incredibly difficult as young men).  So I decided to talk about killing our inner fear, because that is the pathway to both having a strong Frame and also to killing the ego – or, as I sometimes say, *“Not giving a fuck is HUGE mojo.”*  

I also sometimes joke that I met the Dalai Lama once and he was like *“Dude, you are so chill.  What is your secret?”*  Well, here’s how I do it – and what I told the Lama – and how you can do it, too.


**Killing Your Fear and Doubt**


Fear and doubt are your enemies.  Also regret.  The things you will regret in life are the things you *didn’t* do, the shots you *didn’t* take and the times you doubted yourself.  One of the worst things you can do is let your fear rule you.  People who are *afraid* to take chances lead mediocre lives.

Shall I tell you (this is review for guys who read my work) about the famous Wright Brothers Lorin and Reuchlin? ^1  Wait…smth doesn’t seem right to you?  I must mean Orville and Wilbur?  Of course, I fucking mean Orville and Wilbur, because Lorin and Reuchlin got fucking MARRIED and thus got risk averse and their wives made them give up their dreams and made them take jobs down at the lumberyard or the tool & die and they **NEVER DID ANYTHING FUCKING COOL**, like **INVENT THE GAWDDAM AIRPLANE.**  

Lorin and Reuchlin took the “safe” path.  The W-2.  They never dared to do anything great or be anything, and that’s why the world (other than me, and now you) remembers Orville and Wilbur.  

I was chatting with a young friend of mine recently.  He’s a confident guy, and with justification, he’s fucking BRILLIANT.  He has a project he can pursue (I have to be vague here to protect his anonymity, but basically, it involves some high-level math and computer shit that, to me, is indistinguishable from magic) which, if successful, will result in financial independence for him, early in life.  As I do with a few young guys, I check in with him and try to keep him on his path.^2  Lately, when I do, it seems like he’s doing everything *but* working on this project which is *CLEARLY* what he should be focusing on.  He was also talking about getting *another* degree that would take 4 years, but really this is just a delaying tactic.


Why?


Excellent question.^3  There are two things that can happen, either he succeeds, or he fails.  Either way, he eliminates one possibility.  And really, your youth is when it’s time to try new things, and if you fail, no big deal.  In his particular case he has a four-year window before he has to start studying for a professional qualification, so he’s got a four-year fuse to work on his project.  Worst case, his project fails and he winds up with a professional certification and moves on with his life, and ends up being “doctor” or “lawyer” rich, instead of “Titan of Industry” rich.  BFD.


So hopefully, that’s his move.  During the convo, he remarked that I am very centered.  He’s right.  I know what my capabilities are, and I know what my limitations are.  I make decisions, and I am “certain” about them.^4  Except it’s not that I am “100% certain” guaranteed, it’s that I make the best decision I can, based on the information that I have, I control the things I can, I don’t worry about the things I cannot control, and I put things in place so that good things can happened.  Maybe they do, maybe they don’t but I maximize the chances.  And I’m not afraid of failing.  

Why?


*“With the end of the fear of death, begins the death of fear.”* 

-From, The Sayings of Chairman Zaitzev

*“We are born, we live, and then we die.”* 

-Multiple sources, including Napoleon Bonapart, E.B. White and Jonathan Sacks.  


So some years ago, I had a bit of a health scare.  It’s nothing I can control – luck of the draw, really – but something was detected that occurs naturally, but rarely, and if it appears in combination with two other things, can be deadly.  Oh, and the other things are quite common.  


Fuck.


But, guess what?  I don’t have one of the other two markers.  Just like you need three things to make gun powder – charcoal, sulfur and saltpeter – I don’t have the third thing.  Do-Da!  Do-Dah!  So what do we say to the god of death?  *“Not today.”*  A near miss, but a miss is as good as a mile.


Once you have come to grips with your own mortality, there’s really nothing left to be afraid of, and thus you stop being afraid of shit.  I am going to die someday, but it’s not going to be today.


So what lesson should you draw from this?


Stop being afraid of shit.  What’s the worst that can happen?  Take a chance.  Call her. Try your hand at a new skill.  Maybe you will succeed, maybe you will fail, but you will learn something, either way.  

This is why we tell you to go out and approach women.  You are going to fail, but you will learn how to do it.  After the first 25 approaches, you won’t be nervous.  After the first 50, it will no longer matter how hot a girl is.  By 100, you will be thinking, *“What is the most fucked up thing I can say to her and still pull?”*

Blue pill.

Red pill.

Black pill.

It doesn't matter which one you chose.

It doesn't matter how you view the others.

Neither is correct by **itself.**

Neither holds the **absolute truth.**


##[The Blind Men And An Elephant.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant)

So many people get lost that the Red Pill is absolute.

That the black pill is absolute.

That there is no such things as pills.

**Every pill holds some truth.**

Confidence & chasing goals is essential for success.

Looking like a subhuman will make it impossible to succeed.

Failing to have empathy when needed will result in failure.

Everything holds truth.

Blind men get lost touching one part of an elephant & are bold enough to claim it's absolutely true.


###What should be done.

Take the best out of everything & use it to ascend.

Realize the Red Pill & improve your way of thinking.

Realize the Black Pill & improve your aesthethic.

Realize the Blue Pill & improve your personality.

And never get lost in either.

Every single person can improve & succeed.

I don't give a fuck how you look.

I don't give a fuck how you feel.

You can change for the better.

You **must** change for the better.

Everyone has to improve.


####They aren't equal.

You'll use the Blue Pill the least.

You'll disregard the negativity & autism of the Black Pill.

You will use the Red Pill the most.

Being oblivous & thinking that everything around you is true is blue pilled delusion.

Thinking that only looks matter for success is black pilled delusion.

Thinking that only confidence will get you everywhere is red pilled delusion.

#####Takeaway.

This community knows most of this well.

And some newbies can get lost.

This post is mainly for them.

No matter what you believe, self improvement is king.

Being a great person with great karma will always prevail.

Be the bold leader you always wanted to be.

Never give up.

Have an open mind.

Learn & conquer.

Nobody knows everything.

And there is a lot more to learn.

You weren't born to suffer & accept your unwanted destiny.

Rise & live your best life.

We're all going to die one day.

Enjoy the experience.",1632834462.0
325,There is No Such Thing as “Alpha”,146,pwuwbi,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pwuwbi/there_is_no_such_thing_as_alpha/,62,"When guys first jump into the self-improvement game, they have a concept in their heads of a perfect guy they want to eventually become – a guy who’s confident, masculine, great with women, never weighed down by emotions, fears or insecurities. A true go-getter who does what he wants and doesn’t even stop to consider what others might think of him. They call this majestic man, “an Alpha”.Truth is though, there is no such thing as an “alpha”; **it’s a made-up fantasy, the male equivalent of a Disney fairytale.**  
I understand what guys mean when they say, *“I want to be an alpha.”* Hell, **I spent the first few years of my self-improvement journey trying to become “an alpha”.** Most guys do. When you’re starting out with self-improvement/getting laid, you feel like you’re so far from where you want to be – you know you have 10,000 steps you need to take before you’ll be anywhere near happy with yourself. You build up this idealised notion of who you have to become in order to considered a true man.  
This idealised, alpha man is everything you’re not. He is the embodiment of perfection, because that’s exactly who you’ve built him up to be in your head. You’ve mashed together a bunch of idealised traits your perfect “alpha” has, pulling some traits from movies you’ve seen, some traits from celebrities you idolise, some traits you’ve invented that are so impossibly unrealistic nobody in the real world could ever live up to. You know what I’m talking about; an alpha has to have:  


* Rugged looks, a steely jaw.
* A strong, muscular body, but lean too – ready to fight.
* A deep voice that commands the room.
* The ability to sleep with any woman he chooses, with minimal effort; women *swoon* over him and he has his pick of the litter.
* Rich and well-off; money means nothing to him.
* Charming, funny, able to spin a tale and captivate his audience.
* Knows when to stay quiet and mysterious – the strong, silent type.
* Most importantly of all, stoic and never ruffled by anything life throws at him. He seems almost emotionless; he’s the epitomy of stability.
* Twenty other characteristics you sit around fantasising about possessing some day.

The problem is, nobody in the real world embodies all of those characteristics. A lot of those characteristics on their own will take years for any one man to achieve; *let alone all of them added together.* No one man could possibly have his shit together in all those areas. **Your “alpha” doesn’t exist.**  
And putting the label of “alpha” on those traits doesn’t help you in the slightest, because it makes your success *binary* – you’re saying, “I’m either an alpha winner, or a beta loser.” You haven’t left any room for anything in-between; you’re saying during your entire self-improvement journey you won’t be good enough, until the magical moment you cross the finish line and can officially call yourself *A True Alpha™*.  
As you progress through this self-development journey, you’re going to find life is a lot more grey – it’s rarely so black or white.  
**I wish I’d known this sooner.** I wish somebody had woken me up; I wish somebody had slapped some sense into me and told me I would never be perfect, and that I didn’t need to be an alpha. The impetus behind me writing this post is I wasted so much time trying to be Mr Alpha. I spent months – hell, years – trying to be a perfect man, convinced I had to be 100% stoic and cold and emotionless all the damn time. I yelled at myself any time I showed emotion, or felt love/empathy towards the women I dated. I beat myself up for my shortcomings, didn’t allow any room for failures or missteps, and made myself generally pretty miserable. I was a tyrant to myself.  
I succeeded in some ways – I definitely embodied most of the “alpha” characteristics I revered. I became stoic, able to handle life’s difficulties, more quiet and mysterious… but in doing so I also turned myself into a cold-hearted sociopath, a man who hid away any semblance of empathy for others, kept everything to himself and didn’t open up to anybody. I was terrified of being vulnerable, of showing *any* emotion whatsoever.  
I told myself I was “courageous” and “strong” and “brave” to bottle up my emotions & “get rid of them”; that I was making myself a stronger, more well-rounded person by shutting off the “human” part of me. In hindsight, the truth is I was shit-scared the mask would fall, people would see I didn’t have all the answers all the time, and the tower of “alphaness” I’d spent years building would come crumbling down.  
And you know what the worst side effect of trying so desperately hard to be Mr Alpha is? When you’re masculine and stoic all the time – without ever letting your guard down with *anybody* – you get fucking *lonely*. Lonely like you wouldn’t believe – because you’re convinced you can *never* let anybody in, or talk about your problems, or show vulnerability, or confess to a moment – just a millisecond – of weakness. You’re never allowed to have doubts, and you have to be strong *all the time.*  
As for the women I attracted, I ended up with quite a few cold, emotionally-messed-up women; women who were just as emotionally-unavailable and weird as I was. The few emotionally-healthy ones were smart enough to see how much of a fake actor I was being, and they rightly ran away. I was so terrified of acting “beta” around them or showing them any sort of affection/emotion that I over-analysed my every move and conversation, and just came across as *really fucking weird.*  
Just like a pickup-artist, I was always in my own head – **a complete neurotic mess.** I would analyse and go over my every move, my every word, even my own thoughts – “Am I thinking like an alpha?” That pickup-artist/”manosphere” philosophy that there’s a “right” way to be or do something is so shallow and 1-dimensional – not to mention immature. It took me a very long time to break free.  
I had trapped myself in a prison of “I must be alpha all the time/I can never be a beta”, and was totally stuck there. Over time I started to feel like I was caged for life, with no way to reach out to anybody and tell them, “Hey, I’m not so sure I want to be alpha 100% of the time”… because that would be *beta as hell*. And I wasn’t allowed to be beta for even a second, remember?  
Obsessing about being alpha makes you drive yourself insane with neurosis, constantly second-guessing your every move. It’s inevitable when you’re trying so hard to be Mr Alpha, you’ll constantly ask yourself:  


* Am I standing like an alpha?
* Is my voice deep enough, like an alpha voice should be?
* Am I dressed like an alpha?
* This girl Ive been dating for a year just said she loves me, and she’s looking into my eyes, waiting for a response, but it’d be beta of me to tell her I love her too, right?
* Is it beta to tell your best mate of 10 years that you appreciate all he’s ever done for you?
* Is the way I’m leaning against this wall alpha or beta?
* Am I spending too much time with my friends – wouldn’t an alpha spend more time by himself? Am I too needy?
* Is it beta to call my parents too often to chat?
* Would an alpha give a girl a compliment?
* Am I talking too much – aren’t alphas usually quiet and more measured?
* Is it beta to tell my mother I love her?
* Would an alpha see this girl more than once a week, even if he really likes her? Would an alpha even *like* a girl in the first place?
* Am I busy enough – shouldn’t an alpha have an ultra busy schedule and life an awesome, exciting life?
* Does an alpha cross his arms when he’s standing still, or put his hands in his pockets?
* Is it beta to snuggle up to a girl in bed after sex?
* (ad infinitum)

Jesus christ.  


## I Had to Drop the Mask.

Eventually I got sick of always having to hold up this mask and fake being something I wasn’t. I felt like I was living somebody else’s life – none of my achievements felt like my own. If I slept with a new girl, **it was because she liked the “Alpha Andy”, not the “real” Andy.** I started feeling more and more like the real Andy wasn’t good enough. I developed a complex and eventually started hating the real Andy… while simultaneously hating the fake “alpha” Andy as well.  
It took a *hell* of a lot of courage (and a lot of deep breaths), but eventually I decided to try dropping the mask & cutting out the bullshit *to see what would happen.* I tried being real & vulnerable with girls, and put in a lot of self-development work to learn to be ok with being a complete fuckup sometimes. I accepted (with the help of psychedelics and counselling) that is was ok to not be an alpha male all the god damn time – that that was an unrealistic endpoint; one I’d never actually reach. And if I’d never reach it (because nobody ever reaches perfection; nobody’s perfect 100% of the time), then I had to be ok with who I was right now, *even if I still had things to improve and goals to work on.* You don’t have to be Mr Alpha in order to be successful.  
Since dropping this notion of being a perfect “alpha”, life has become a billion times easier. It’s like a massive burden has fallen from my shoulders; *like I finally let out a sigh I’ve been holding in for years.*  
For one, I don’t hate myself – I don’t feel like I’m miles short of being the “perfect” man; I’m cool with the fact it’ll take me a couple more years to be where I want to be.  
I’ve been more honest with my mates, and I’m now unafraid to tell them when I’m having a shitty day, or let them see my bad sides. I’ve let girls in, been open and honest and *real* with them. They no longer run away and instead regularly say, “Wow, you are brutally honest about everything. I like that.”  
I’m in a happy relationship where I also bang other girls (and share girls in 3somes with my girlfriend) – and my girl has learned to mirror my openness and share absolutely everything with me/her friends, without this immature notion of trying to be perfect all the damn time.  
Girls have been a lot more open with me, and many have told me they respect my honesty/vulnerability: I've got screenshots / proof [here](https://killyourinnerloser.com/alpha/).

Best of all, I write posts here and on my blog and have poured my heart and soul out onto the keyboard, being as real and vulnerable and *fucking honest* as I possibly can be. When I was obsessed with being an alpha, I could not in a billion years have even tried to offer advice to others – I was too caught up in my own neurotic thoughts of “I’m not alpha enough” to be able to relate to anybody, let alone empathise and offer useful help.  


## “100% Alpha, 100% of the Time”

If you’re anything like the stubborn jackass I was a few years ago, you’re sitting there resisting everything I’ve just said, thinking to yourself, “Look at this beta cuck, giving up completely. I’ll be an alpha, no matter what he says. I’ll be masculine in every way possible. *I’ll do what he couldn’t do.*“  
Truth is, **nobody is 100% alpha in every area of their life, with every person they interact with, and at all times.**  
The biggest, meanest badass guy you see in the gym might cry any time his girlfriend is mad at him.  
A guy who has his shit together with women may be a complete little bitch when it comes to his office workplace, and be completely unable to stand up for himself when his boss tells him off.  
The doctor with the kickass job and kickass salary who exudes “alphaness” at work may act like a “mummy’s boy” any time he goes home to visit his family for the holidays.  
Elon Musk, one of the leading thinkers and innovators of our time and a guy who does seemingly whatever the hell he wants (he strapped a car to a rocket, is pioneering AI research, wants to build an empire on Mars, even sold fucking *flamethrowers* *and jetpacks*) – is not an alpha all the time. He has been divorced 3 times… *Twice by the same woman*. He’s also cried on stage/in interviews multiple times. Is that “alpha”?  
Even the guys who *write about being alphas* aren’t 100% alpha, 100% of the time – they can’t possibly be. Mike Cernovich has a lisp and a soft voice – is that alpha? Rollo Tomassi, a man who’s built an empire on talking about “*alpha” vs “beta*“, took nearly a decade of writing before he was finally brave enough to do a face reveal and stop hiding behind his computer screen – and even still, he uses a fake name. Would an “alpha” be scared to reveal himself?  
No disrespect to any of these men – they’re solid rolemodels who took me a hell of a long way with my own self-improvement. They’re my idols. And that’s my point – even my own idols (Musk, Cernovich & Rollo Tomassi) are fallible – they’re not alphas all the time. The definition of “alpha” changes depending on who you ask; **one man’s alpha is another man’s beta.**

  
Alpha archetypes like James Bond don’t exist in real life. People are human, with human emotions and stresses and insecurities and fears. Nobody is strong and stoic all the time. Even Marcus Aurelius, king of stoicism and toughness, had moments of self-doubt and despair. You are going to be a mess sometimes – and that’s totally ok. You have to give yourself permission to suck sometimes, because sucking is part of being a fucking human.

These days I’m not alpha, I don’t pretend to be – I’m just *Andy*. I’m not some bullshit caracature – I’m *exactly* like you. There’s nothing stopping YOU from doing the same thing.  
When you're starting y**ou’re just a guy who’s at the start of his self-improvement journey.** And when you get further down the track, you won’t magically turn from a beta into an alpha. You’ll simply be “the guy who’s now further along with his self-improvement journey”.  
And if there’s still a part of you clinging on to the notion of “becoming an alpha”, I’ll throw this at you: do you think the masculine, confident, successful “alpha” you’re trying to emulate sits around constantly worrying about whether or not he’s an “alpha”? Fuck no – he’s too busy living his life and working on his goals. You need to do the same; **just get on with working towards your goals and stop worrying about being “alpha” or “beta”.**  
“Becoming alpha” also implies there’s a state of “alphaness” you can obtain where you’ll be successful; a certain threshold you’ll cross and then suddenly be considered an alpha.  
Alpha isn’t an end-point – **there’s no such thing as an endpoint to self-improvement.** There’s no point you get to where you’re finally happy and you can take a rest and coast for the rest of your life. You’ll never be completely satisfied, and when you achieve your goals you’ll immediately want to set off on the next big mission.  


## The Takeaway

“Alpha” isn’t some arbitrary list of traits. If you really want to be masculine, just do what you want, work towards the goals you’d like to achieve, and stop worrying about what other people might think of you. *Especially* stop worrying about whether other people will think you’re “alpha” or not.  
Don’t focus on trying to live up to some ideal notion of an alpha man; you’ll end up spending your life chasing a ghost. Show a little realness. Don’t be afraid to say how you fucking feel – even if it’s the “wrong” thing to say.  
As for being “perfect” – fuck that. Just focus on making small, gradual improvements; make each day a little better than your previous day.  
Please, please, ***please*** don’t get caught up in all the alpha bullshit like I did – I don’t want you to waste months or years trying to perform perfectly like some fake actor, never removing the mask, constantly second-guessing your every move for fear of not being alpha enough. **You’re already fucking good enough.**  
Now go out there and kick some ass.

326,The Hero's Journey is the core of an attractive emotional experience for women,180,pwiuqi,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pwiuqi/the_heros_journey_is_the_core_of_an_attractive/,98,"Here is some text from a book I am working on. Please let me know your comments/thoughts:

The primary value and most attractive thing about the archetypal alpha is the he generate a fun, safe, transcendent emotional experience. On the surface, it looks like women are primarily interested in things like money, looks, status, and power, but those peripheral indicators are attractive not as ends in themselves but because they subconsciously indicate to women that the man is an alpha and therefore can create awesome emotional experiences, both now and in the future. Women want adventures, not things. Humans are never satisfied and want to constantly dive into the unknown to find something better than what we currently have. As George Bernard Shaw famously said, “A man’s reach should exceed his grasp, or what’s a heaven for?” Mens’ attraction to women is primarily physical, but womens’ attraction is mental. She wants somebody who can take her on an emotionally and intellectually stimulating adventure that she cannot go on herself. 

The structure of the ideal emotional experience for human beings is the Hero’s Journey, which generally comprises the following key elements: the Hero 1) ventures into the unknown, 2) defeats a challenge or obstacle (including other people), 3) obtains some attractive resource, and 4) brings the resource back to share with the tribe. According to the mythology expert Joseph Campbell: “A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.” Because humans evolved to feel most engaged when pursuing the Hero’s Journey, Campbell argued that the Hero’s Journey is the substructure of almost all popular world myths, religions, and fictional stories. George Lucas used the Hero’s Journey as the basis of the Star Wars films, and artists like Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke and Christopher Vogler, the producer responsible for Disney movies like Aladdin and the Lion King, have also admitted to using this formula. 

For our evolutionary ancestors, the most important thing a man could do was to venture into the unknown, defeat challengers, and obtain resources for himself and his tribe. Humans literally evolved to hunt, whether animals or more abstract goals like women, money, or success. You are probably reading this book right now because you want to succeed at hunting women. If you just wanted sex, you could save a lot of time and money by buying a prostitute, but you do not just care about sex – you want the thrill of conquest. Women did not evolve to hunt themselves, but rather assist men and vicariously experience the thrill of hunting, including when the man hunts women. Even if your Hero’s Journey is just finishing college or getting a promotion at your accounting job, women feel attracted to that adventure on a deep, biological level. 

Because the Hero’s Journey is the basis of an ideal emotional experience, I return to it often in this book. You should incorporate the elements of the Hero’s Journey in every emotional experience you create for women, including when planning a date, crafting a conversation, or doing almost anything else. The more elements of the Hero’s Journey in your emotional experience, the more her mind and emotions will be stimulated. Whenever the novelty and positive emotions of a particular adventure wear off (for example, the challenge or the resource you were chasing is gone), you must take decisive action to change the adventure to keep the interaction emotionally appealing and resonant. This comes with practice; you yourself will “feel” the emotions draining out of an interaction and you will know when you need to make a change. Women are dopamine junkies and the moment the dopamine runs out she will go look for it somewhere else. 

The Hero’s Journey is emotionally appealing because it is based on core elements of human psychology. First, humans are attracted to transcendence – in the ideal Hero’s Journey the Hero leaves the “ordinary world” and enters the supernatural world, where familiar laws and order do not apply and he is faced with novelty and challenges. Therefore, when a woman enters your emotional experience she should feel like she is transcending her normal reality. You should take her places and create experiences for you she cannot normally experience because you are more interesting, smarter, and transgressive than her.

Transcendence is based on the idea that “the grass is greener on the other side of the fence.” Women would rather give up guaranteed fun for the possibility of better fun in the transcendent unknown. What actually happens on the other side of the fence does not even really matter or need to be that great - it is the act of jumping over the fence in hopes of something better that stimulates her emotions. Your adventure with women should be a perpetual crossing of the fence, and whenever you feel like an emotional experience is getting stale, you need to just move to the next thing, whether it be the next conversational topic, bar, or activity. Sometimes on dates I take women to three different mediocre bars, we have a drink at each place, and then we go back to my house. None of the bars were even that great, but just the act of going new places stimulates her emotions. 

As of the writing of this book one of the most popular exclusive nightclubs in New York City is a place called 1Oak. 1Oak is very hard to get into, even for beautiful women. But within 1Oak there is a secret room that is even harder to get into. Every time women find out about the secret room in 1Oak, they immediately lose interest in the regular part of the nightclub and instead became obsessed with getting into the secret room, no matter how much fun they were having in the regular party. Getting into the secret room is like a mini-Hero’s Journey: it is a challenge to get into, it is the unknown, and there is a valuable resource inside (a DJ and dancing). There is nothing special about the secret room – it is just different people dancing to the same corny nightclub music – but the very act of jumping the fence excited them. 

It may sound exhausting to need to constantly “transcend” with women, but the reality is that you should already be transcending in your own life. You should constantly be seeking novel and exciting emotional experiences for yourself, so all you are really doing is bringing the woman along on an adventure you were going to be on anyway. 

Second, our brains release most of our dopamine during the pursuit of the thing we want, rather than after we get the thing want. In other words, humans prefer the journey over the destination, the adventure over the spoils of war. As the famous comedian and cocaine addict Artie Lange once said, “the most fun part of doing cocaine is the drive to your dealer’s house.” For the same reasons, humans evolved to want to tackle large challenges on the way to the things they want. On some primal level, humans even feel like if there is no challenge the thing was not that valuable in the first place. 

All fun involves a challenge, whether it be playing against somebody in a competitive game, a conversation that challenges your beliefs and taxes your intellectual abilities, a travel adventure, doing something that scares you (like skydiving), consuming some kind of art like a book or movie that makes you think, etc…. As the psychologist Jordan Peterson says, a challenge is most emotionally meaningful when it lays right on the border of “order” and “chaos” – too much order and the challenge is boring and too easy; and too much chaos you are too in the unknown and overwhelmed with anxiety and difficulty. When you interact with women, you will FEEL whether the challenge is in this sweet spot; and you must intensify or change the challenge when it is getting boring, and to lessen the challenge when it is getting to difficulty. 

The most important challenge, however, is you. The most valuable thing for a woman is not this or that thing, but rather access to a man that can generate future awesome emotional experiences. She should feel like you have access to all the money, parties, and cool things in the world, but to get to those things she needs to “win” you over, which she can never completely do. The woman should feel a little anxiety around you because she must feel like if she blows it her emotional experience will be permanently shittier. I explain how to be challenging in the next chapter. 

Third, the Hero’s Journey is attractive because it involves some valuable resource that one can only obtain from the transcendent world. Therefore, your challenge must have end goal in mind; women do not get enjoy being challenged for no reason. But the end goal should be more than just material things – it should be something higher and spiritual; often the attractive resource is a change in the hero himself. Many men think that they can win womens’ favor with money, fancy dinners, and nice cars, but those things are a dime a dozen. Any fat, corny real estate agent can buy her that stuff. What is much more valuable to women is a life-changing conversation, an interesting adventure around the city, or just being inspired and motivated by somebody who is better than her and who she aspires to be. 

But the most important resource of all, however, is the feeling of pursuing the Hero’s Journey itself. Super Mario Brothers was a popular video game because learning how to beat the game was fun, not because you actually get to the fuck the Princess when you beat the game. What turns women on the most is the ability to feel the alpha male’s confidence, calm, enthusiasm, positivity, and joy as he conquers the adventure. Although she needs to feel like there is a pot of gold at the end of the journey, it is the journey itself which brings her the pleasure, and once she reaches the end she will completely forget about the pot of gold. 

Finally, the Hero’s Journey is attractive because humans enjoy engaging in reciprocal transactions. Humans evolved to live in tribes so we could work together on projects and exchange resources based on our contributions. In a healthy relationship, each party gives their fair share given their role in the dominance hierarchy, and is rewarded proportionately for their contributions by the alpha male. And the best way to form an emotional connection with somebody is to engage in reciprocal transactions with them over many cycles so their subconscious mind starts to see you as a trusted partner. In an ideal adventure with a woman, you provide the leadership and the physical and emotional muscle, she helps you, and you both share the resources brought back from the adventure. 

I know an extremely rich guy who, on paper, had everything women supposedly wanted – he was tall, good looking, rich, and had a lot of high status friends, including celebrities and famous DJs. He would throw giant parties with tons of alcohol, snacks, drugs, and whatever else women wanted. But unfortunately this guy was boring as hell – he was timid, awkward, and he was afraid of being edgy or making conversations interesting. He owned a really cool tech company but did not want talk about what he did with women because he did not want to look like a nerd. 

Even though this man had everything on God’s green earth that men think women want, women would constantly get bored and flake on him. Drinking champagne on a yacht sounds like fun, but after about 20 minutes the women would get restless and start looking for the next adventure. Even though I did not have all the cool stuff this guy had, I regularly stole women away from his parties because I could create a better emotional experience. Most women, even dumb materialistic whores, would leave a yacht with cocaine and champagne to go have a deep conversation about spirituality or relationships, explore a weird part of town, or just be in the presence of a confident, joyful man and not a fucking pussy.

One time this guy had a huge party at his fancy condo and a street thug showed up and started threatening people, acting creepy towards girls, and generally ruining the party. The rich guy was too afraid to confront him so the thug hung around for like 30 minutes until some girl tricked him into leaving. After the thug left, the women at the party lost a lot of respect and attraction for the rich guy because they were disturbed on a deep, psychological level. What good is all the champagne and cocaine in the world if the alpha male cannot protect her from the evil monster from the unknown? Women would rather eat McDonald’s in a dingy apartment with a man who makes her feel safe than drink champagne in a mansion with a fucking pussy.   

Of course, women DO like things money, nice cars, and fancy dinners. Everybody likes those things. And given the choice, most women would choose a guy with BOTH material things and an adventure. But the excitement and positive emotions generated by the Hero’s Journey are much stronger than the fun of material things, and women evolved to choose a confident, dominant man with no material things on a fun adventure over a rich guy with a boring adventure. Studies have even shown this. Nevertheless, some women have addictions to lower pleasures like drugs, partying, and a lavish lifestyle, and are forced to be with inferior guys to feed these addictions. There are many beautiful women who date and have sex with ugly losers just because they are addicted to stupid things. Instead of hating those women, you should feel bad for them – their addictions have forced them into accepting a substandard emotional experience. 

If you find that a woman is only interested in hanging out with you if you are taking her to fancy dinners and crazy parties, and not when you are doing regular things, she is probably not emotionally invested in you and she is just using you for material things. A woman who is emotionally invested in you wants to be part of your emotional experience all the time, even when there are no material things involved. In fact, spending a bunch of money on women is unattractive because it subconsciously indicates the man is not really enjoying himself and he is doing all this stuff to supplicate to her. The best dates you will have are the ones where you do something simple that you genuinely enjoy and spend very little money on hem. Again, you may be able to have sex with women by impressing her with material things, but it is generally not a good use of your time. 

A few final points. First, women are not attracted to real adventures, but rather the appearance and positive FEELINGS of an adventure. Real adventures involve stretches where you may be bored, anxious, angry, depressed, or experience other negative emotions, but women are not interested in that. You can be on the most fun adventure in the world, but if you constantly project feelings of anxiety, depression, and timidity, the woman will not be attracted to you or the adventure. Conversely, a man can be doing relatively unimpressive things and still generate these emotions if he feels confident and joyful to the woman. Women are often attracted to losers like drug dealers, aspiring rappers, and party promoters because they project the emotion that they are on some fun adventure, when in reality their lives suck. An accountant or sales representative usually an objectively superior life than a drug dealer, but he often does not project a viscerally fun emotional experience women can vicariously enjoy, so they are not as attracted.

Second, womens’ desire for adventure is a subconscious impulse, not a conscious, rational decision. Even if a womans’ rational brain hates a man, she will feel a jolt of attraction and positive emotion when she sees him joyfully knock down challenges on the way to the things he wants. I have seen many women bemoan the fact they find street guys who carry guns attractive because they know it makes no rational sense for a smart, educated, professional woman to be attracted to a piece of shit who carries a gun he will almost certainly never use. But her subconscious mind cannot help but fantasize about the guy moving through the world and gunning down his enemies as he seeks the things he wants. This is also why people are fascinated with serial killers and love movies about gangsters like Scarface and Goodfellas. Our rational brain knows those guys are terrible human beings who almost always meet a horrible demise, but we cannot help but imagine ourselves living their life: not giving a fuck, breaking all the rules, killing our enemies, getting whatever we want, going on insane, dangerous adventures, and having a ton of fun.

327,Mental Fog: Lazy & Unfocused. Diagnosis and Cure.,262,pwcx4p,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pwcx4p/mental_fog_lazy_unfocused_diagnosis_and_cure/,62,"Lazy, unfocused, unmotivated, binge eating, mindless scrolling on my phone, excessive videogames. This is how I would describe myself at times; when I am in the state of what I call 'the fog'

The fog is a state of mind where you lack clarity on long term goals, you lack motivation and energy for daily (good) habits. You feel lazy, and prefer comforts. You don't feel like putting in effort to groom yourself, Binge eating, video games, or binge watching TV shows until you fall asleep may be the preferred methods of 'passing the fog.'

If you find yourself diagnosed with 'the fog', your main goal should be understanding and then lifting the fog. This may take some time so be patient with yourself.

**UNDERSTANDING THE FOG**

Before you try to gain clarity and feel better, first always make a mental note of trying to understand the fog - and realising that you do not have to feel a 100% driven 24 hours a day 7 days a week. It's just impractical. Do not be harsh on yourself. Self hatred leads to vicious cycles gaining momentum towards hell. Ask yourself the simple question, why do you feel this way?

Is it because of something you did?

Something I did: I maybe in the fog because I binge ate something I shouldn't. I personally had lots of trouble with food. Often at times I find myself worsening the damage by binge eating even more, due to the fallacy of thinking that 'eh, the damage has already been done, might as well.'

Understand that the numbers do matter and play a role on your brain. Following the theories of neuroplasticity; creating circuits in your brain, the amount of time you may have spent on the 'bad thing', or the quantity of junk food you have consumed will strengthen the brain circuitry of the 'bad thing' you are trying to free yourself from.

Nobody's done anything great with a 'might as well.'

Is it anxiety related, such as overthinking?

Write it down, address it, face it and confront it. Do not seek comfort in simple pleasures hoping that your worries will disappear. Like the skeleton in the closet, sooner or later you will have to address it. Take some time, sit down, think & write about what's on your mind.

If you feel like you must make the time go by faster, or believe that you are more mentally prone to anxiety symptoms, make a conscious decision to do something that does not reinforce the bad habits you are trying to break. This does not mean you mindlessly binge watch hours of Netflix & eat a tub of icecream. Perhaps you may choose a better medium ground that helps you towards your goal, maybe a documentary on a hobby of yours and popcorn.

The fog may also come with physical symptoms. Understand the underlying causes of it, acknowledge it and let it pass with time. It's okay not to feel 100% as long as you don't worsen it.

Sleepiness/tired → masturbation, lack of sleep

Headache → binge watching, lack of sleep.

Stomach discomfort → binge eating

so on so forth.

**LIFTING THE FOG**

To lift the fog, is to regain clarity on your short and long term goals. To be able to focus on current tasks at hand and make better decisions. To be able to stand a bit taller, to feel like you are totally in control of your actions.

Lifting the fog, should be a readjustment. It is not laying a new foundation or a life-changing experience.

Notice how 'goals' are involved. If you're lacking long term goals, find some time to read about SMART goal setting, and set some proper goals for yourself. Yes, that's right. Goals are important as it gives you a sense of direction in life, where you're headed - that's what you're striving for and when achieved increases your self esteem, making you focused and more engaged in whatever task is at hand. Start slow, and regain momentum towards the direction of your potential. Small wins add up to big wins. It's the initial acceleration, the inertia that you're fighting as you lift the fog.

1. Understand the fog.
2. Set some short term goals (maybe some to-do tasks just for today), and execute as soon as your physical symptoms allow.
3. Gain momentum and move towards your goal.",1632731763.0
328,Negative Game,85,pwgxc2,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pwgxc2/negative_game/,32,"Negative game  - 

**Intro** 

A phenomina that I'm sure we've all experienced once in our lives is a man who *looks* like he fucks, yet gets no bitches. 

Often enough, this man has plenty of chances to *slang his thang,* yet, despite the amount of positive female attention his appearance attracts, he can't seem to deal. 

So, what gives? 

*** 

**Body** 

The inverse of this situation happens often enough as well - a guy seemingly does nothing, yet he is able to just get girls by showing up. This is neutral game. Not doing anything right, but not doing anything wrong either. 

The difference between the former and the latter man is that the former has *negative game.* 

**Negative game is when your personality - be it your mentality, the things you say, or the way you act - over rides your positive and attractive traits.** 

To give a tangible example, let's picture a guy who has *the look* of a guy who fucks. Whatever that guy looks like in your mind doesn't matter. Just picture him, and a woman who approaches him based off his looks. 

Now, imagine that same man speaking in a high pitched voice, ending each sentence in an upward inflection, as he actively describes being a 26 year old virgin that really loves and appreciates his mother. 

On top of all that, he never makes a move. 

His negative game has rendered him unattractive to the woman. 

*** 

To use another tangible example, let's take 3 martial arts students. 

Andy used to take Karate classes at a Mc-Dojo, Bobby never took any martial arts classes in his life, and Chad wrestled in high-school. 

Chad already has an idea about what's going on, and just has to continue doing the right things he learned from the past as he incorporates the new lessons he learns now. 

Bobby is a clean slate, and has to start as a noob, but atleast he isn't having to unlearn bad habits. 

Finally, Andy, not only does he have to put in work to ingrain the correct techniques into his style, but he has to deliberately unlearn the retardation of his McDojo to avoid being knocked out over and over again. 

***


**Conclusion** 

*Sometimes, all you need to do is show up and not fuck up.* 

Having positive game (confidence, swagger, wit, intelligence and et cetra) will always help, while sometimes, neutral game is all that is necessary to get a lay. Doing *just enough* while intentionally avoiding making any mistakes while the woman transfers her fantasy about who you are and what you're about onto you. 

Success is about doing the right things, and avoiding the wrong things. 

Negative game is one of the worst things for a man to have when practicing seduction.",1632748852.0
329,"About her ""High Standards"" - Standards of neediness aren't standards of being. And even after having it all, she still won't be happy.",183,pw98uu,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pw98uu/about_her_high_standards_standards_of_neediness/,31,"**TL:DR - Don't give two hoots about it. High standards of neediness are never worth the struggle in the end.**

# When she says she has high standards, observe the fine print on if she brings anything to the relationship at all

Where exactly does she have high standards?

Almost always these standards are only standards of neediness and expectation. There will never be a single standard related to what she has to offer. I need not get into the lists of expectations, I think they are well known and ever growing and ever more ridiculous. Out of all the rings, the most important ring they wear is the suffering.

Also the list of qualities she claims about herself being strong, political, opinionated and honest (yeesh) -- they are really just screaming ""I make an extremely poor team player"". In the best teams, like the military, the first thing they do is cut this very attitude down to size zero and then rebuild you as a proper team player. Real teams win and lose together, celebrate and suffer together.

Their idea of being strong is about as immature as the bully who goes around beating others up to feel strong you know....

And no, just adding a footnote at the bottom ""And of course, I'll be good to them too"" doesn't mean horses\*\*\*t. It shows how much energy has been devoted to that part compared to the rest of the list. And that's exactly how it will unfold.

# Standards of expectation aren't standards of being. Standards of living aren't standards of life

And certainly not standards of abundance. Such people are usually narcissistic with huge egos and have no awareness of what they're like to be with for any extended period of time. That's a question that's best answered by looking at whoever is with them.

It's important to see if people have any kind of standards of being -- by which I mean, do they ever offer a single moment of real happiness or responsibility or abundance to themselves first? Let alone others? **Do they ever live in a way that makes you want to be with them?**

Is the only thing they're offering to others are one sided relationships, neediness and miseries? Chances are, you'll eliminate a huge percentage of the population on this simple question alone. I mean I would add loyalty to that equation, but these days given the way things are -- that is a standard which I can only enforce alone by myself, for myself, as a boundary. Chances are, more often than not, that a lot of such people with high expectations are awful people to be with.

Fact is, most of us spend a lot of time on everything else expect looking at ourselves honestly in the mirror and asking ourselves the question of just how we want to be. Because that would mean having to own our s\*\*t.

# The needier you get, the more unhappy you'll become

I spent my entire last post just on that part. Of course we have needs, but then there is a difference between needs and neediness. Those who have no idea of the joy of giving, or the joy of abundance, those are the ones who need more and more and more from the world just to fill themselves up and stop feeling worthless and miserable. And it fails, because it's just like an addiction.

**We expect the world to fill up precisely what's missing within ourselves**. **The most miserable people demand the most that the world should make them happy.** And the bigger that list gets, the less we have to offer. The bigger the consumer mentality, the lesser the producer mentality.

Don't feed the black hole. It only grows bigger.

# Don't think for one second that she'll be happy if all her expectations are met

When has that ever worked? As long as she's stays in her own frame of ""high standards"", you're never good enough, she's going to spend her whole life consuming, resisting, making herself miserable and offering little if nothing.

And if you can't live up to her ""standards"", you're anyway going to be looked down upon. Horribly so. Why do you want that to happen to yourself.

It's a myth that great standards of neediness can produce great happiness. And yet more and more people buy that lie.

**One can have the entire universe, have it all, and still be unhappy**. There are plenty of people who have it all and then complain of the burden of carrying it all. There are dominant women who want to rule the house and then hate the fact they need to own it all.  I know way too many people who are privileged in ways that most poor people in poor countries can't dream of, and still - they're not happy.

Such people lack gratitude and can't recognize the worth of even simple things they take for granted. There is no question of being happy without gratitude.

And you believe her if she says she'll be happy in the end? Nope, seek those who are happy now.

Just look at the way they live and end up down the road. Their life reflects who they really are. The real problem was within themselves all along. If you're constantly unhappy in any situation, just remember the one constant in all situations is only yourself.

# The things she fills her life with are not necessarily what she brings to the relationship

This is kind of clear from the list of who she says she is and what she brings to a relationship.

Her high paying job, ""independence"", educational qualification, social status and unsustainably expensive tastes aren't what men look for in the end (if they're being authentic). Those are things she does for herself. **It won't mean anything if she has not a moment or joy or love on offer.**

Ok, the student debt might be brought in on your head. Or someone else's illegitimate kid.

There is a video on one of those channels for men about how an architect guy making $130 k a year broke up with his tech girlfriend making $200 k a year after hearing her disrespect him to her sister. And towards the end, what she really thought about him was bared open. So yeah, as the top rated comment on that video put it *""Money can help you buy a condo in New York, but love, respect and humility are priceless""...*

Plus -- **the things the modern woman boasts about are actually the things that make MEN attractive to women**. I've seen way too many women wonder why they have it all apparently and it isn't enough to attract good men. Men of dignity and self respect don't live off someone else's wealth for a start.

#These days her expectations have devolved from shit test to actual delusion

These days I see the issue of her expectations turning into something else that it wasn't even a couple of decades back. The degree of entitlement is just crazy. Her ""high standards"" thing is no longer just a shit test which you can laugh off, but in modern days, with the way modern women are brainwashed and an oversupply of low quality attention everywhere, it has devolved into actual delusion and narcissism. Women actually have ended up with impossible fantasies believing they deserve it all and don't owe anything. Maybe the wall might bring them down to reality, but you'd do yourself a favor by filtering such people out at the beginning.

# Those with delusional expectations are pretty much incapable of offering anything of worth or facing challenges

The emptier they are, the more outrageous the expectations. The greater the narcissism, the more the delusion. 

Going by the theory that we expect from the world what we can't offer to ourselves (and by extension, anyone else). You can bet that these women aren't going to bring one beautiful moment in your life. 

Guys, if there's one thing we've learned, it's that we need to embrace the suck and the discomfort as much as the pleasant. The best partnerships are forged among those who embraced the difficulties together, those who suffered together, those who faced adversity together, because adversity demands unity to be overcome. 

These characters aren't gonna last a single moment outside their comfort zone. They'll never grow, never have much of worth to offer. They just love making victims of themselves because the world and men just wasn't good enough for them. 

They aren't worth your time. 

# You want to know who people really are? Wait for life to bring them back down to earth

Outwardly extremely prideful people looking down on others are often deeply insecure and fearful within themselves. They have used the stuff of their expectations and filled themselves up with a lot of things to outwardly look confident, beautiful, sexy, independent, secure, rich, famous, and look down on others. But what if life takes a sudden turn and throws them a serious test by taking away the very things they used to conceal their true selves?

For e.g. People who fill themselves up with only the things money can buy probably don't have much of what no amount of money can't buy. In that sense, they've cheapened themselves big time.

Just look the lives of celebrities -- I mean, they wear their issues and destructive life stories behind the scenes like some  badge of honor.

I'm not saying money, fame, looks, status, adoration, etc. are a bad thing, They're fantastic, far better to be rich than to be poor, those who piss on the rich hate themselves -- but let's be real when it comes to some qualities that money and your outward possessions can't buy. The people around them who have to put up with their crap will never remember them for their bank account balance, nor will those people take anything money can buy with them to the beyond when their time's up.

This bringing down to earth event need not be life shattering. Just getting a little older and not so youthful anymore....and....

For a lot of them, the bare core of fear and suffering is going to be starkly exposed. And that is why they have little to bring to a relationship.

# Even some of these women can be cracked open by shrugging off the shit tests

I know plenty of women in my extended family and circles. When they were younger, I knew how they used to be. But even their armor cracked up eventually and then it turns out they're really far more vulnerable and easy than it looks. For some of them, their intimidating appearance is a shit test. You won't believe how much some of them crack up when you simply walk off and aren't bothered to be afraid of her.

This doesn't apply to the true narcissists or the crazies though. I wouldn't touch those with a barge pole. Just the ones who're keeping up the defenses.

# Feminism made women independent, apparently, but not abundant

**What it really did was make them needier in the end.**

One thing that feminism will never do is to actually address the problem of neediness and the intrinsic misery it brings. It's increased the standards of neediness a lot more though. I mean when have you ever heard them talk of the word abundance? That involves actually offering something to others (gasp, shock, outrage!). Right?

And no, they're not nearly as independent as they sound. I know one girl who acts that way as long as her dad pays for her bills. And beyond that, actual independence is a myth  -- it's often won at the price of debt and corporate slavery. We may come out of codependency, but the world is always interconnected, and no one can really live in a vacuum.

Interdependence is the only reality. All those boasting of independence are just chest beating their narcissism.

# I don't owe anything to anyone....expect my nastiness?

We are always offering something in every single interaction, even something simple as eye contact. There's no avoiding it. Thing is, if we aren't offering something pleasant, we are almost certainly offering the unpleasant. When goodness is 100% conditional, nastiness is 100% unconditional. Observe for yourself.

It is a sad world where people only offer their good side when they're in debt right?

That's textbook narcissism.

# At the end of fulfilling her mile long list, what she has to offer is seldom worth it

If I had to make an iron rule for myself, this would be the one. It should have been clear if you saw the way she wrote it. Ultimately if expectation is the only thing we sincerely practiced over a lifetime, when it's time to give, we have no idea what to do.

# The happiest people are those who have what no amount of expectations can buy

I look at the happiest faces in the world, the people who live the most meaningful lives, the people whom others want to be with. And in all of them, I find one quality -- they have that which no mile long list of expectations can finally get in the end. They offer their gifts to themselves first and it soon overflows to others. They are producers. Their lives aren't built around accumulating expectations to hide their toxic misery within. That's why other people want them in their lives. Their standards are actually authentically high. And as a result, they often end up getting far beyond their expectations. And they're grateful for it too.

#At this point, you should know what your actual masculine standards are

Someone down below made it look like I'm looking at women's standards for validation. Nope, I'm just talking about how BS her whole idea even is, and why there's no need to play by her rule book or her mile long demand list. 

Honestly at this point you don't need to even listen to what she wants as standards anymore. You have been here for a while, read all you can, worked on improving yourself, understanding actual human behaviours. You should be having your own, very good standards and your own style. You know what matters on the basics, you know what objective standards masculinity demands of you in being your authentic best self, and over and top of that you know what standards are uniquely yours. You should be meeting your own high bar. Then it's only a matter of who is compatible enough with that, or not. 

Just remember, women make the rules for guys they don't like and break every rule for guys they are hopelessly attracted to. It is true that when push comes to shove most of them will forget that a list like that even existed.",1632715169.0

Darren Hardy, the author of ""The Compound Effect"", asserts that *small, smart, choices made consistently over time* makes for a radical difference. In his book, he goes in to depth explaining the massive results that could originate from seemingly imperceptible changes in our life. The compund effect integrates naturally in many, if not all, of TRP's topics. Small and smart choices on a daily basis let us create habits and a lifestyle that accommodates real and massive change. We all know instinctively about these choices; someone makes the decision to drag their sorry ass to the gym on a bad day. Someone chooses to skip the donut in favour of eating... nothing else. Before we know it we've dropped 35bls, or we bench 225lb for reps, maybe we talk with every person in sight effortlessly - all thanks to the small choices made every day. The power of this praxeology spells consistency.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

To reap the massive benefits from the compund effect, we must first master the art of consistency. Consistency, if you don't know by now, is one of the most important concepts in TRP. The intelligent ones reading this post have already deduced this, but for the spergs out there I'll make it painstakingly clear with the help of the Cambridge dictionary: ***""[consistency is] the quality of always behaving or performing in a similar way""***. Read that again. Not only is this crucial in shaping our habits and in the long run - our life, but at it's core, it's an integral part of frame.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Now, you might think to yourself; ""Where's my bullet point list about discipline to masturbate to? Did I fetch my lube for nothing?"". If this is you, you can go ahead and fuck right off now because you're not in a state to ingest the contents of this post. For the ones still here, I'll describe what practical steps you have to take in order to build a rock solid foundation of consistency with the help of discipline. Consistency is the quality we build, and discipline is the tool we use. 


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

In ranger school the first thing you'll learn is how to stand correctly, how to say yes correctly and how to make your bed the right way. Some men find this practice completely meaningless but there's a much, much higher purpose behind this routine than the crayon eaters understand (they always end up carrying the machine gun). The purpose of executing these seemingly small acts the proper way is to practice your discipline. If you can't convince your peers that you could make your bed when you're dry, fed and after a nights sleep - how the hell could they trust you to bring the right equipment to an ambush, or remember the right frequency for the radio in the field? The point here being; no one is born with a high amount of self-discipine. It is something we practice and get better at in increments, as with everything else in life.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

With that lesson in mind we move on to what practical steps you can take to increase your discipline. First, the prerequisite for bettering your discipline in your civilian life is to acquire a physical notebook or calendar. I don't care if you think there's an app that will do the same job in a more convenient way - get a physical notebook. This notebook or calendar will serve as your accountability partner on your journey. The second thing you will do is to create your list. This list is holy to you. You and your list now live together inside your notebook.

The list should contain a number of actions you would like to take every day in order to become the man you want to be. If you want to be big and fit, the list should contain ""Go to the gym"" as an item. If you want to be a man that reads, you put ""Read"" on the list. If you want to lose weight the list item reads ""make a healthy dinner"". You get the point. 
Now - and this is important - the list should contain a number of small, elementary items. Items such as ""Brushing my teeth"", ""Cleaning the kithen before bed"" or, why not, ""Shine my shoes"". These small tasks will act as our gateway drug to discipline. With your list of items - no more than 10 - we move on to the next step. 
You now choose one (1) of the simple, gateway items from your list and write that task down on every weekday the coming week in your calendar or notebook. This means; 


&nbsp;
&nbsp;



Monday| Tuesday| Wednesday
---|---|----
Shine shoes| Shine shoes| Shine shoes
...and so on.

Now. What ever happens in the world, in your country, in your life, you will shine those fucking shoes. If you get fired from your job - doesn't matter - you shine your shoes. If your friend dies in an accident - doesn't matter - you shine your shoes. If your oneitis begs you to come over and put a baby in her - It. Does. Not. Fucking. Matter. You shine your shoes first. It's just one measly task. This is the mentality you will have over the coming weeks. If something is on your list, you bet your life that you will execute that task and put a checkmark next to it. After you've done that - you're free to do whatever you want. As an anecdote, this is what Jocko means with discipline equals freedom.  
  
**Here's the important part for all you computer touchers^1 ; the shoe shining doesn't have to be perfect.** It is imperative that you understand this. Some days even the small task of shining your shoes will seem insurmountable, the important part is that you execute the task anyway. In practice this means that you pick up the shoe, brush it once, and then put it back. There. You can put a checkmark in your notebook for today. Allowing yourself to execute this task without it being perfect alleviates the pressure of doing it in the first place and you should, with a clean conscience, say that you are done with the task for today. But you will do it. With time you will notice that shining your shoes becomes much easier, and you will start to do it with a higher degree of precision. This is your mind telling you that the task has become a habit - it is no longer something that is hard to do.    


&nbsp;
&nbsp;


The second week, you add another simple item to your notebook from your list of tasks. You will have to trust me here, because you will have an urge to add multiple or more complex items to your list. Nothing stops you from doing these things anyway but you are not putting them on your holy list. Yet. Your list now contains ""Shine shoes"" and ""Brush teeth"". Guess what. These are two things that are now part of your life and something you do not, under any circumstance, skip. I can not stress the importance of not overloading your list with items the first month(s). Anyone who started 5x5 starting strength with ego weights knows exactly what I'm talking about. The load goes from easy to impossible real quick. It's the same with discipline. You will crash and burn if you increase the holy items too quick. To be clear; you start to add the simple items (the light weights) to your notebook and build on those easy tasks with more challenging items like ""Go to the gym"" or ""Make small talk to a stranger"". Only you know the inherent hierarchy of your items regarding difficulty.
You now see where this is going. For every week that goes by, you add another task to your daily list of things that you will do no matter what. For example, a day in week five could read:


&nbsp;
&nbsp;


Monday| Tuesday| Wednesday
---|---|----
Shine shoes| Shine shoes | Shine shoes
Brush teeth| Brush teeth| Brush teeth
Read| Read| Read
Make dinner| Make dinner| Make dinner
Go to bed 22:00| Go to bed 22:00| Go to bed 22:00


&nbsp;
&nbsp;


This means that you gradually increase your discipline while also building a life that you want, and a life that you don't compromise with either. This method helps you to not just build a frame of consistency, but it will also assist you in holding that frame when your friends asks you to join them on a three day bender, or when that oneitis wants some attention and thinks she can squeeze some out of you. By the time you add the last task to your list, you will be executing the first items by habit. 


&nbsp;
&nbsp;


Yes - it will take time for you to put all your items on your list - but that's the point. During this time you are effectively practicing your self discipline either way, and for the ones of you that have none at all, this is exactly what you need. Small, progressive, overload. Not advice on how to get lean in 30 days or a youtube video explaining the concept of discipline for you. No. With this method you are taking action. Real, measurable action. And that's the only way to build discipline.

I thought I was the shit and that be alpha I had to be a womanizer. During that time I was in a serious LTR of 2 years. I stupidly told her I was talking to another woman, which broke her heart, and ended up fucking me up for years later.

During this time I was near suicidal from the rejection I faced. I blamed female nature for how she reacted. I was bitter. I was weak. 

The real point of TRP isn't about womanizing. It's about taking responsibility and becoming a competent man. Mastering a skillset and always leveling up. Getting better. At some point you stop caring about a beautiful womans opinion on you. Because you know what matters most is your opinion. 
Why? Bc only you see the struggle, planning and failure after failure. Becoming competent is the only way boys can build confidence. When you have skills that people will pay for,  you will walk taller. You will exude character. You develop frame. 

When feminists complain about men. It's because men aren't taking responsiblity. Toxic masculinity is a lack of masculinity. There's too many bitter, bitchy boys. We need to  meditate, build and guide our community. Get out of your comfort zone and throw yourself into the world. Get out of your mom's house. Explore the world. Talk to strangers. This is a right of passage to become a man.  Only when you test yourself, will you learn who you are and what you want. What you consider impossible today, can become easy. But you must train.

332,Invisible Wars Pt.9 - Respecting the Jab: How to Draw and Enforce Boundaries.,199,pszxp7,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pszxp7/invisible_wars_pt9_respecting_the_jab_how_to_draw/,34,"TL;DR - Just read the **fat stuff**.

**\*\*Storytime: Respect the Jab\*\***  
 A few years ago, I was competing in a martial arts tournament. This particular competition was of the ""get hit in the face"" variety - not just performing choreographies in front of some judges.  
 

Since a lot of these tournaments run on a KO system, there is usually a wide variety in skill between competitors in the first rounds.  
 This was quite noticable in my first opponent. He was quite bad actually. His moves were wide and telegraphed and he had more tells than a four year old pulling a ""+4"" from the stack.  
 However - he was 8 years younger than me, ripped as hell and he had gas for miles.   
 

He was also perfectly willing to get hit in the face - either that, or he accepted that there was little he could do about it with his current skill-set.   
 

Now when experienced fighers fight, they usually measure each other up with a series of little jabs and feints before serious fistycuffs ensue. They rarely get in each other spaces at first: There is barely any fire coming down the centerline - but there is a tangible *\*threat\** of getting hit. The feinting and jabbing is for figuring out a way around *\*that\**.  
 

Now *\*this\** guy was having *\*none\** of that. He was coming straight down the middle, asking to get hit in the face - and I kindly obliged. It was a rinse and repeat: Him walking into my space and me bonking him on the nose - which he seemed not at all concerned with...  
 

Until, eventually, I misread the timing and he hit me with the nastiest low kick imaginable. It was sloppy, but it stung bad. It was Bruce Lee's worst nightmare. This was that guy who practiced *\*one\** kick *\*one\** time and decided he was good to go, because he did crossfit the other 5 days of the week.  
 

Or to paraphrase Ali: This motherfucker floated like a monstertruck and stung like... well... an even bigger truck.    
 

I also noticed another thing: I was beginning to gas out. I had wasted all my energy chipping away at him for points and I had failed to see the obvious - This man was not respecting my jab.   
He wasn't respecting *\*any\** of my strikes, actually. He was also not playing for points. He was there to hit me as hard as he could. Nothing I did so far had left a sizeable impression on him.    
 

And there I was - circling, circling, getting tired. Instead of decisively ending the fight at first chance, I was hesitant - and thereby taught him I am not to be feared. Allowing him to walk me down, to draw blood. I started hitting him harder, but past experience had already proven to him that he could win. He was hearing me breathe heavier. I was in his world now...    
 

**\*\*Boundaries are worthless if not enforced\*\***   
 

The lesson here is that boundaries are only as good as you are at enforcing them. In my fight, I was at first neglectant of  enforcing my boundaries. And then, when I noticed I was in danger, I was unable to.   
 

That same pattern can be seen in pretty much any social setting that is prone to conflicts - most of all work and relationships.   
 We all have heard the stories of girlfriends growing ever more disrespectful of the man they are supposedly in love with. Or of lazy-ass co-workers dumping an increasing workload of turds on your desk, which they are either unable or unwilling to clean up themselves.  
 

If seen from a distance, it all seems so clear: ""*\*Man the fuck up!\**"", you say to yourselves.   
 

But why is it so hard then to finally *\*change\** something?  
 

Why is it so hard to *\*stand up\** for ourselves?   
 

**\*\*At first, you are not establishing boundaries - you are course correcting\*\***  
 

In the German language, we use the word ""Grenze"" for interpersonal boundaries, which I feel is a lot stronger. It means ""border"", which highlights the following aspect perfectly:  
 

**\*\*In order to draw a boundary, you need to have a valid claim to the thing you are drawing boundaries around\*\***  
 

Now with your own body, that border is well defined. You have claim over your own body. Our skin is a boundary that is recognized culture-wide. Only a few people will deliberately cross this border against your will. Doing so is a widely recognized dick move - and even if you are powerless to defend yourself, the perpetrator will lose social status over this. (Unless he is a highschool bully).    
 

When it comes to other domains however, things get fuzzy. If you girlfriends / co workers have been able to repeatedly carve out large chunks of your time and energy, and have been left unchecked, *\*they\** will feel they have a claim on these things.  
*\*They\** will feel like you are trying to challenge *\*their\** claim, overstepping *\*their\** boundaries.  
 

**\*\*When trying to reclaim your claim, rock the social boat as little as possible\*\***  
 

Even if, on paper, you have the *\*right\** to loudly and openly re-claim your claim, it does not mean it is *\*smart\** to do so. Don't go Rambo. Rocking the social boat, even with a justified demand, can get you to lose social standing fast.  
 

Instead, whenever someone comes up with an unreasonable demand, just be busy. Be *\*sooooorry\**, but don't budge. Don't compromise. Don't explain yourself in detail. Throw fog. Don't make promises Other things have priorities. Leave it at that. You are under no obligationto justify yourself. If they keep drilling at you, kindly remind them you are busy and get on with what you actually want to do.  
 

**\*\*Remember: If you have a valid claim to a boundary, you do not need to explain yourself.\*\***  
 

Explaining your reasons for a boundary in detail is just giving the other party more ammunition to take it down. ""I don't want that"" is enough. Use DARE, not DEER.  
 

**\*\*Someone asking WHY to a valid boundary is already probing and therefore not accepting that boundary\*\***  
 

Some people just can't help to double check every boundary they stumble upon. They love the thrill of inching up to the line. Presenting a clear boundary is presenting them with a juicy target. Hell, some women even get turned on by intentionally overstepping a boundary and then seeing you enforce it.  
 People like this are the reason for the next advice:    
 

**\*\*Explaining your boundaries explicitly and in detail is an act of affection and friendship and needs to be earned\*\***  
 

Explicitly telling your boundaries to people you value is an act of friendship, because it helps them build more secure relationships with you. It is handing them a manual to your psyche.  
 Explicitly telling your boundaries to people who do *\*not\** respect you, however, will cause them to creep right up against them. This is bad because:    
 

**\*\*In order to be socially relaxed and not constantly on guard, you want people to keep a safety margin around your boundaries\*\***  
 

**\*\*Even a slightly tapped boundary is a challenged boundary\*\***  
 

People will keep this margin through respect - either because they value you as well as your friendhip and would not want to lose it. Or because they fear you - sometimes you gotta make them respect your jab.  
 

**\*\*Never show your hand by detailing the consequences of overstepping\*\***  
 

Some people might decide they are fine with the consequences and push on regardless. Ín that case:    
 

**\*\*Have a concrete plan of action ready for each boundary. If push comes to shove, react quickly - otherwise your reaction will feel like petty revenge.\*\***  
 

Also, one last bonus tip    
 

**\*\*Some people are idiots and accidents happen\*\***  
 

Calming word of advice: Not everyone overstepping a boundary is doing so on purpose or out of neglect. *\*Some people are just borderline clueless.\** If one of them happens to tresspass and trample on your domain, kindly show him to the door, inform him of the rules and leave it at that.

*Protesters took to the front of a fraternity house at UMass Amherst on Sunday as members there have been accused of sexual assault.*

*The group of college-aged people gathered at the Theta Chi fraternity and chanted, according to Amherst police in a press release. Around 12:12 p.m, authorities responded to the scene after one of the fraternity members called. When police arrived, the group numbered roughly 300 people.*

Ok, so we should all be against rape - I certainly am.  Consent is a thing and you need to be sure you have it.  I want the girl (or girls) to be super into what I'm doing to them.

So 300 people show up to protest sexual assault at Theta Chi's UMass chapter, demanding they be disbanded/suspended, and wondering why the University values fraternities over women.  

*“After beginning peacefully, the protest became destructive when members of the protesting group threw objects at the building, tore down a flag, and attempted to gain entry, through force,” police said in the press release. “A fence on the property was damaged and vandalized.”  One of the residents was hit in the head by a bottle thrown by a protester, police said. His injuries were thought to be nonlife-threatening. No one else was reportedly injured.*

Hey, crowds turn ugly and if you don't want 300 angry people showing up at your doorstep, don't rape anyone, right?

Well, sure, but the kicker is this:

*On Monday, UMass Chancellor Kumble Subbaswamy shared a statement with the community. He said that, while the university condemns sexual violence and is committed to investigating reported incidents and survivors,* **no one has yet come forward to file a complaint.**

You got that?  No complaint of sexual assault, but you can bet that Theta Chi will be ""presumed guilty until proven innocent"" just like the Duke Lax team was and just like Phi Kappa Psi at UVA was. 

Now, maybe smth happened at Theta Chi and there *will* be a complaint, and if someone *was* assaulted for real, then fuck the guy(s) who did it, but this is the state of affairs in 2021.  Guilty until proven innocent and nothing proves you innocent.",1632244259.0

Strength is everything. If you’re not strong, you’re weak and weakness is useless. Women don’t want useless men.

*The female, not the male, determines all the conditions of the animal family. Where the female can derive no benefit from association with the male, no such association takes place.* 

This is the iron rule. The foundation of any relationship with a woman. It doesn’t change no matter how much you try to run from it. When we say “All Women Are Like That” we mean *All.* Don’t try to cope by looking for some tradwife in bumfuck sewage land or lying to yourself.

**Grow the fuck up. Get stronger. Kill the weakness within yourself.** 

I don’t know where this myth of women being retarded stemmed from. Women are sharks. They have to be to survive because they’re physically and spiritually weak by nature.  They can sniff your weaknesses and insecurities like a bloodhound. If you have one too many weaknesses you put yourself in the “bitch” category.  

I’m not going to tolerate that. 

Neither should you.  

You need two things to be strong in order to be completely strong: Your body and your mind.

---

#Body
Strong isn’t relative. Strong is strong. If you don’t look strong, you aren’t strong. If you look in the mirror and question yourself you need to keep growing. Take a good look at your physical weaknesses and find a way to fix them. Be honest with yourself and realize this is going to be a very long process. Too many people quit once they don’t become Louie Simmons or Larry Wheels in a day. If you want to get stronger, and I know you do, here’s what I do.


#####Eat. 


Stop eating like an underwear model and get jacked. Eat lots of animal protein, a fair amount of clean carbs, and a good amount of fat. Being big, or athletic at the least, is essential. Nobody looked at a skinny dude and said “He can protect me” they most likely thought “He can run."" He has to run in order to survive. Only cowards run. If you're fat as fuck clearly you don't need this step. Use common sense. 


#####Learn how to fight and kill.


Become dangerous. We live in polarizing times and you need to know how to defend yourself and whoever is in your tribe. I don’t care how you do it, just do it. Take up a martial art, learn how to use a gun, get it done. Men aren’t meant to be tame little cage rats, we’re meant to be fighters and warriors when necessary. 


#####Lift to be intimidating. 


Learn how to powerbuild. Get strong and make sure you look strong. I’ve put my body through the wringer since I started lifting and I’ve come to find out that this type of training is better for balance and longevity. Obviously, push yourself but don’t kill yourself. You shouldn’t leave the gym downing painkillers because you took yourself to ego-city but you shouldn’t leave the gym without being tired either. High reps and medium weight will build both strength and muscle at a consistent rate, you’ll be big and strong.   

---


#Mind 

Your body may wither but your mind won't. Make your mind as strong as steel and you'll always be strong. It doesn't matter what happens to you, you'll be fine as long as your mind is strong.


#####Read. 


If you can get it at a college library or Barnes and Noble it’s probably not worth reading. Don’t read trash that makes you a slave to the very system that made you weak. Everything you’re told not to read by the masses, read. Everything you’re told to read by about 99% of people, throw it away. Only listen to people in your tribe, people you take advice from, and people who have what you want. 


#####Practice a concentration practice.
This tip is vague for a reason. I don't know who you are or what your interests are. Take up a hobby that forces you to concentrate on something for an extended period of time. Most people have the attention span of a goldfish and you need to overcome that if you want to be mentally dangerous. Take up meditation, a strategy game, Magick practices, prayer, anything. Something that resonates with you that forces you to focus your entire mind on something. All the strength in the world doesn't matter if you can't focus.


#####Learn how to read people. 


Most people have the emotional and social IQ of a cucumber and it’s probably half of why you’re on this subreddit. You don’t know how to read body language, tonality, and pick up the little things in women. Do you know what mirroring is? Do you know what it means? Do you know about proxemics? What they mean? Do you know when she’s faking all of this to lead you along? These are the things you need to know if you want to be successful with not just women, but people in general. Study it, internalize it, throw it away. It’ll be one with your instinct.  

######Disclaimer: When studying body language and social cues, don’t be a (English cigarette) and overthink every single interaction. You’re going to paralyze yourself. Seriously. Read it, internalize it, throw it away.  


---


#Conclusion

*People’s weak points are rarely muscles. It is almost always their head, their heart or their lack of discipline/consistency - Jim Wendler*

At the end of the day, you shouldn’t be getting strong for women, you should be getting strong for you. Women are, and should always be, a side effect of your own thirst for growth. Women come and go but strength is forever. Even when you’re old and withered your mind will be made of steel and your soul will be made of gold.  

I could go on and on about more things to do to make yourself stronger but I don’t want you to keep reading these posts, I want you to **Act.** I want you out there living your life as a man maintaining masculinity in a world where being masculine is dangerous. Women love masculinity and danger. 

I’ll see you out there.

335,Woujo's Guide to Anxiety and Depression,160,prvsgd,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/prvsgd/woujos_guide_to_anxiety_and_depression/,29,"**Disclaimer**

I did not write this article just for people with mental illness. I wrote this article for everybody, because depression and anxiety are normal parts of being human, and everybody is vulnerable to these emotions spiraling out of control. I understand that depression and anxiety are often very deeply ingrained problems caused by a host of biological, chemical, and hereditary factors, so if you are deeply ill I recommend that you go to some kind of medical professional and consider taking drugs to stay afloat. I believe that most people can take actions that can improve their depression and anxiety, but if you are so paralyzed with negative emotions that you are suicidal or cannot make any progress in your life, you may need drugs until you get to the point where you can make progress.  

 I am not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, nor do I have a degree in any kind of psychology. I am just a guy who enjoys writing about subjects that interest him. If this article helps you, fine, if it doesn’t, ignore it.  

**Introduction**

For human beings, positive emotion primarily comes primarily from two sources: 1) pursuing desirable goals and 2) feeling accepted by the tribe. Pursuing desirable goals produces feelings of enthusiasm and confidence. Acceptance produces feelings of calm, contentment, and spiritual enlightenment. Anxiety occurs when your subconscious mind feels like you are failing at pursuing desirable goals. Depression occurs when your subconscious mind feels like you have failed at being accepted by the tribe. 

Anxiety and depression are linked because humans evolved to only feel accepted by the tribe after they do something to contribute to it. And to contributed to the tribe you must successfully pursue desirable goals and bring back some resource for others. People who do not feel like they are successfully pursuing desirable purposes that lead to valuable resources often feel worthless to the tribe, and this feeling of worthlessness causes depression. 

Depression and anxiety are alarms that evolved to warn us if we are doing the wrong thing. Both involve a similar cycle (what I call the “**Rumination Cycle**”): 1) an external stimulus indicates to us that we are doing the wrong thing, 2) we feel negative emotion, which causes us to freeze and stop doing whatever we are doing, 3) we collect information, 4) we process the information we have collected to determine a new purpose, and 5) the negative emotion clears and we get moving again towards our new purpose. 

Depression and anxiety become pathological when we get stuck in the Rumination Cycle and the negative emotion never clears. This can occur because 1) the relevant information we need to pick a new purpose is not available to us, 2) we fail at processing the information correctly, 3) we are overwhelmed with too much negative stimulus to process, 4) our alarms go off for the wrong reasons, and many other reasons.  

**Your Subconscious Mind**

To understand depression and anxiety, you must understand that your subconscious mind is not “you”. Our subconscious mind is almost like another person living inside of you, who has plans, thoughts, feelings, attractions and aversions that are complexly independent of your conscious mind. When you realize that the voice is in your head is not “you” and that sometimes it is wrong, you can engage in meta-cognition, which means thinking about thinking, and disconnect your “self” (whatever that is) from your thoughts and emotions. Once you can view your thoughts and emotions with a cold, objective eye, you can start working on fixing some of the more destructive ones.

Depression and anxiety are diseases of the subconscious mind. Nobody wants to be depressed or anxious, and if it was as easy as reading a few inspirational quotes or “toughening up” everybody would do it. The reality is that our subconscious minds sometimes develop a horribly distorted view of the world which causes them to produce intense negative emotion that is completely unjustified. Oftentimes people that are incredibly rich, powerful, and loved feel depression even though on paper they are the most “accepted” people in the world. Similarly, some of the most secure and competent people you will ever meet will suffer from intense anxiety. Our subconscious mind is a strange thing and fixing it is often a very difficult task. 

You may read some parts of this article and think “that doesn’t apply to me.” The truth is that the basic wiring of everybody’s subconscious minds is the same. Some people are genetically predisposed to have slightly higher positive or negative emotion than average, or to feel more or less pleasure at certain activities, but the primary difference between humans is how we tutor, shape, and accommodate our subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind can be your best friend or your worst enemy, and you must work hard for it to be the former. 

Battling your subconscious mind is difficult for a variety of reasons. First, our subconscious mind is much more powerful and sophisticated than our conscious mind, so we often need to rely on it. We cannot just ignore or repress it. It is impossible to consciously think about every single little thing we do, think, and feel in our lives so our subconscious mind has input into almost everything we do. Secondly, our subconscious mind often infects our rational mind with negative, counterproductive, and false thoughts in a process called confabulation (I discuss confabulation later in this article), so we are often “tricked” into thinking we are having rational thoughts when our thoughts are really just justifications for the emotions generated by our subconscious mind. To make matters worse, our subconscious mind often connects these negative thoughts and emotions to real data from the outside world, so we believe these negative thoughts and emotions are real and justified (not realizing that these thoughts and emotions are ignoring a lot of other real data from the outside world). Over time, these negative thoughts and emotions accumulate, weighing us down and tormenting us. 

To defeat these negative thought-emotion bundles, it is not enough to think, talk, or wish. The only thing that changes the emotions in your subconscious mind is action. You must create a routine for yourself that generates positive emotion in your subconscious mind, and then use these positive emotions to individually attack each of these negative thoughts that have accumulated (trying to attack them without the requisite positive emotion is too difficult). This process may take a long time because you often have years of negative thought-emotion bundles to unwind and fix, but you might as well get started now. 

**Goal Conquering**

Human psychology is best understood in terms of purposes. Everything we do is either consciously or subconsciously directed to some purpose, and our subconscious mind is always trying to figure out what purposes to pursue. Generally speaking, we evolved to pursue purposes that 1) feel pleasurable and 2) we see a clear path to attaining. Humans generally prefer delicious food over mediocre food, but we evolved to settle for mediocre food if we see a clear path to the mediocre food and the delicious food is guarded by a lion. 

Humans evolved to hunt, and the neurochemical associated with hunting is dopamine. Dopamine is associated with focus, confidence, pleasure, and enthusiasm. Almost all pleasure comes from dopamine, whether it be eating food, having sex, winning something, etc… But interestingly, our brain releases most of the dopamine ON THE WAY to the pleasurable object (what I call “**journey pleasure**”), rather than when we are consuming the object (“**destination pleasure**”). As the famous comedian Artie Lange once said, “the best part of doing cocaine is the ride to your dealer’s house to get it.” Successful people often have all the money, status, and friends they need, but they still go to work every day because the hunt is what motivates them. From an evolutionary standpoint, it makes sense why journey pleasure is stronger than destination pleasure: evolution needs to motivate us to hunt the deer; it doesn’t care as much if we enjoy eating the deer afterwards. But even though destination pleasure is much weaker than journey pleasure and lasts for a much shorter time, if we cannot find journey pleasure we will settle for destination pleasure.  

Journey pleasure is maximized when we: 1) venture into the unknown, 2) defeat challenges or threats, 3) hunt down a resource-rich target (preferably one necessary for survival), and 4) bring back the fruits of the hunt to share with the tribe. Goal conquering also causes us to feel accepted and valuable because we have contributed to the tribe. 

**The Problem**

**What is Anxiety?**

Anxiety is basically an alarm that makes us freeze when our subconscious mind thinks we may be pursuing the wrong purpose (or in other words, hunting the wrong target). We feel anxiety 1) when our subconscious mind thinks that the paths to our purposes are blocked by threats or obstacles, or 2) when our subconscious mind perceives multiple equally appealing purposes and cannot decide which one to pursue. When anxiety kicks in, our subconscious mind enters the Rumination Cycle until it figures out a different purpose to pursue. 

Anxiety is also caused by the unknown. In fact, most anxiety we feel comes from the unknown and uncertainty rather than consciously identified threats. The unknown induces anxiety because 1) the paths in the unknown to appealing things may be populated with threats and 2) the unknown is full of infinitely equally appealing paths.  

Anxiety is linked to memory, which is why drugs that alleviate anxiety often negatively affect our memory. Our subconscious brain is always trying to build a map of the world around us, both of our immediate physical surroundings and our abstract future. It then populates this map with the threats it detects to prevent us from running into those threats in the future. For example, if we touch a hot stove and burn our hand our subconscious will register “hot stove” as a threat and try to cripple us if we consider reaching for a hot stove in the future. Unfortunately, this map can become polluted with false alarms so we find ourselves afraid of things that are not really threats. To keep us safe, our subconscious mind is overly conservative so over time our internal maps become polluted with more and more phony threats, causing us to become more and more narrow minded, afraid of the world, and stuck in our ways. Even worse, this causes our subconscious mind will write off certain paths as impossible before they even get to our conscious mind. 

The opposite of anxiety is confidence. Confidence is the same thing as journey pleasure: we feel confidence when our subconscious mind feels like there is a clear path to its goals unobstructed by threat, and we are making progress towards them. Therefore, to feel confidence and defeat anxiety we need a plan that we feel like we can successfully execute. If our plan feels too difficult or riddled with too many threats, we will not feel confident and motivated. We do not need to actually achieve our goals to defeat anxiety: we just need to feel like there is a clear path to the goal. Most mentally ill people first manifest their mental illness in their mid-20s, and I suspect that is because people’s early 20s are when they are given freedom to choose their own goals and are not given any plan or routine.  

Confidence also requires certainty that you are on the “correct” path, and by “correct” I mean that there is no better path for you to be on. If your subconscious mind feels like there may be a better path to be on, it will strike you with anxiety. Obviously, it is impossible to be completely certain that you are ever on the best possible path, and there is usually something better you can be doing, but you need to come to some type of peace with your purpose. I think the way to obtain this certainty is to 1) pursue the biggest possible purposes that you are realistic for you and that you enjoy, 2) spend some time every week looking at your purposes with a cold and objective eye to make sure you are doing #1.  

Because anxiety depends on our progress to our goals, the goals we choose partly determine how much anxiety we feel. If are pursuing purposes that our subconscious mind feels are too difficult, intimidating, or remote, we will feel anxious and overwhelmed. Unfortunately, many people feel anxiety because they do not consciously choose their own purposes: their purposes are determined by their friends, their family, their society, their emotions, and other influences they are not consciously aware of. Part of the reason so many people feel anxiety in the modern world is because society imposes unrealistic standards as to what people should achieve, have, and look like. 

Neurochemically, anxiety is our default state. The brain works by exchanging messages using chemicals called neurotransmitter, and the neurochemical GABA slows down the activity of excitatory neurotransmitters. Most anti-anxiety drugs, like Xanax and alcohol, work by stimulating GABA receptors in the brain. Too much GABA makes one drowsy, sleepy, and stop producing memories. In other words, the alarm is “on” by default until we give it something (abstractly a plan, chemically a drug) to turn it off. 

**Anxiety Disorders**

The part of the human mind that controls anxiety originally evolved in primitive animals to detect physical threats in the jungle, but in the human mind it is also used to detect more abstract threats that may happen far in the future, like the possibility of getting fired from our job or dying from a lightning strike. Because physical threats in the jungle often meant sudden death, our anxiety system evolved to be risk averse and overly sensitive to threats. It makes sense to be risk-averse in the jungle: if you take an uncertain risk the award is a little bit of food or maybe some sex, but the danger is death. 

It makes less sense, however, for human beings to have an overly sensitive anxiety system. Our minds can detect abstract threats that may lie in the future and outside our immediate perception, but we often do not have enough information to accurately gauge the severity or possibility of those remote threats. And because we do not have adequate information to decide our next move, we get paralyzed in the Rumination Cycle. Infinite bad things that could happen to human beings, so our anxiety system can register almost infinite threats at any time. 

Our capability for abstract thought makes us vulnerable to intense, constant anxiety. In the Bible, after Adam and Eve ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil they immediately went and hid behind a bush out of fear because they realized the world is full of threats. Many psychologists and philosophers have noted that the question is not why humans feel anxiety, but why they do not feel constant, overwhelming anxiety.   

Many psychologists and philosophers have theorized that art, business, religion, and philosophy are all human constructions created to overcome anxiety. Basically, humans create “civilization” to make us feel safe from threats and to give us goals to pursue that kill our anxiety. But modern society is constantly changing and becoming more and more unpredictable and complex, which has led to an increase in anxiety. On top of this, people are given goals by society that often feel remote, unreachable, and littered with threats – goals which people do not have the preparation to successfully pursue. Modern liberal society also gives us infinite opportunities, infinite potential ways to live your life, and much too much information, which it makes it difficult to pick a goal, successfully make progress towards it, and feel confident that you are doing the right thing. The decline of religion, a declining trust in authority, a failure to adequately educate and discipline children, and a news media that is intent on scaring the shit out of us also serve to increase terror. 

**What is Depression?**

Depression is the feeling of being rejected from the tribe. Depression is a normal and necessary part of life, but becomes a disorder when you get stuck in the Rumination Cycle and feel like there is nothing you can do to be re-admitted back into the tribe. Depression is often characterized as “learned helplessness” – you have “learned” that you might as well give up because no matter what you do, it is impossible for you to contribute to the tribe and become accepted again. 

One of our strongest emotions, if not THE strongest, is the desire to feel accepted by whatever we perceive the “tribe” to be. We are usually attracted to the most appealing tribe, and we perceive the most appealing tribe to be the group with access to the things we want (resources) and can protect us and the resources. When you are a child, the “tribe” is usually your family, but as you grow older it can be your friends, company, gang, romantic lovers, and society itself. The tribes you seek acceptance from are determined by your values, because the resources you find appealing are determined by your values. At the same time, however, the tribe can also subconsciously and subtly change your values without you even realizing it. 

The desire to feel accepted is stronger than almost any of our other desires, which is why people often change their likes, dislikes, interests, personality, and even identity to conform to the tribes they want to join. To ensure we stay loyal, evolution has caused our desire to be accepted stronger than any of our lower desires. People sacrifice themselves for their family, their country, and even their company because their desire for “honor” and status in the tribe is stronger than anything else, sometimes even stronger than their will to live. In addition, the emotion of “love” is related to acceptance. In fact, some psychologists describe “love” as “acceptance” + “joy,” the joy presumably coming from the fact that the person is getting the things they want from the tribe now that they have been accepted. And just as feeling accepted is one of our strongest positive emotions, feeling rejected is one of our strongest negative emotions. Biologically speaking, love is acceptance and depression is grief of love lost.  

Feelings of spiritual elevation are also related to feeling accepted by the tribe. A spiritually enlightened person feels simultaneously “wholeness” and “nothingness.” They feel “whole” because they have been fully accepted into the tribe, which means they have access to all of the resources of the tribe. But they also feel nothingness because now that they have access to all of the tribe’s resources, they have no desire for them. Addictions and obsessions with material things and bodily pleasures are the result of fear: because we feel like have been rejected by the tribe we have an impulse to consume as much as we can because that might be the last time we get access to those resources. Of course, this is all subconscious – you never actually have complete access to resources – it is a feeling that your subconscious mind generates based on the input it receives. 

You do not need to feel accepted by every single person in the world or every tribe, but you do need to feel acceptance from SOME tribe to stay mentally healthy. Humans did not evolve to live as hermits completely disconnected from one another. “Loners” claim they are happy usually because their loved ones hurt them so badly they feel better off alone. But you evolved to seek relationships with others and your challenge in life is to find a good group of people to form relationships with.  

For optimum mental health, your tribe should 1) consist of people you respect and value, 2) have fair and transparent criteria for acceptance, 3) will not arbitrarily or unfairly reject you, and 4) accept you relatively unconditionally, even when things are going badly for you. 

Many things cause us to feel accepted: compliments, attention, reciprocal interactions with others, others complying with our requests, being explicitly included in activities, etc… But the thing that most solidly makes us feel accepted is being rewarded for something we did to contribute to the tribe. If we feel like we provided others something meaningfully valuable, we feel much more “secure” in our acceptance than somebody who gets compliments or attention for contributions of little objective value (like looking good). We evolved to only feel accepted after we did something for acceptance, so deep down we know when our acceptance is fake. Being competent to contribute makes us feel confident: once we know we can contribute to the needs of the tribe, that by itself helps us feel like we could get accepted by others. 

Conversely, when we consume the resources of the tribe without contributing, we subconsciously feel worthless. Even if people tell us we are loved and accepted, deep down we still feel insecure. In fact, Sigmund Freud theorized that humans have a “death instinct” that makes them want to die when they feel they are no longer contributing to the tribe. This death instinct can manifest itself as consciously suicidal thoughts but it can also be subconscious, causing us to engage in dangerous and self-destructive behaviors because we subconsciously want to hurt ourselves. The evolutionary reason for the death instinct is simple: once you become a liability for the tribe, it is better off for the tribe for you to be dead. Others have theorized that humans evolved to attack enemies of the tribe, and when we feel like we are hurting our own tribe we turn that rage back onto ourselves. In other words, depression is “aggression turned inward” - our body attacking itself as punishment for hurting the tribe. 

Because depression is aggression turned inward, you must be careful to not beat yourself up too much when you fail at something or you get rejected. You should characterize your mistake as narrowly as possible, fix that narrow mistake, and then keep moving. Your attitude towards yourself should be “I am a valued and important member of the tribe, and I made a mistake, like all valued and important members of the tribe sometimes do” rather than “I completely fucked up and now I am a useless drag on the tribe.” You also need to let go of your past failures and rejections with the same attitude – “I made some mistakes, I learned from them, and now I am back in the tribe.” Part of forgiving yourself and loving yourself is talking about your issues with somebody else – sometimes articulating your failures and rejections makes you realize how stupid and insignificant they really were. 

Depression activates the Rumination Cycle to figure out what we did wrong so we stop doing it and rejoin the tribe. Everybody feels mini-depressions throughout their life, which are an important tool to help us correct our behavior. If you fail at something or do something to hurt others, and in return people look at you unfavorably, you probably should not feel good. But depression becomes pathological when we get stuck in the Rumination Cycle and cannot escape, perhaps because 1) we do not know what we did wrong, 2) we do not know what to do to be re-accepted, or 3) it is impossible for us to do the thing that the tribe demands to gain reacceptance.   

Depression induces a stress response, anhedonia (the inability to enjoy pleasurable things), and grief, similar to how you feel when a loved one passes away. Grief comes from the same part of your brain that causes you to feel pain, so depression literally feels like you got hit by a truck. Depression also induces psychomotor retardation, which makes it more difficult for you to move your muscles. The purpose of these feelings is to feel pain, stop enjoying things, and stop doing things so you ruminate on what you did wrong. Some theorists have even suggested that one of the purposes of depression is to make lower-ranked apes stop fighting the alpha male for dominance in the tribe after they have been defeated.

The neurochemical most closely associated with depression is serotonin. The higher a person’s status in the tribe and the more solidly “accepted” they feel, the more serotonin they have. Conversely, if one feels like they are the fringes of the tribe or rejected, they have less serotonin. Serotonin is correlated with feelings of happiness, contentment, and connection with others. Serotonin also causes the release of other neurotransmitters that produce feelings of well-being, like dopamine, oxytocin, norepinephrine, and others. Serotonin is related to practically every single positive emotion a person feels, which makes sense – once we feel accepted into the tribe, we feel like we have access to all the resources and protection of the tribe. For this reason, most anti-depressants by increasing the serotonin levels in your brain.

She said yes and I thought she was a good girl. She came from a married family, went to church every Sunday and and was in the choir and we were happy for 6 months however we got a new manager and you know where this is going. To make it short she met someone the manager and she connected with him. I originally thought cool she got a new friend. They got close to close for my comfort but I let it go thinking she was just friendly. Well what  happened is she went to a concert with the guy and I fucking had to ask who she was going with despite mentioning said concert for 2 damn weeks. To add context when she hung out with her other guy friend she told me where they were going and kept in contact so this was sus as fuck. I had to basically bagger her to get the answer to who with. I'll give you a three Guesses who with. When I confronted her with this she said she felt more of a connection with the guy despite the fact they only met a month ago. I broke up with her on the spot but damn that shit hurt. When I asked why it basically boiled down to how he made her feel and how he has his shit together, he drives a better car is in much better shape than me (working on this) and makes more money than me as a manager and now I have to watch them be all flirty while it pisses me off.

337,Hypergamy is your best friend.,76,prtwaf,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/prtwaf/hypergamy_is_your_best_friend/,40,"I'll get to the point. Hypergamy should not be fought but rather studied, understood and accepted as part of feminine nature. Women are hypergamous not by conscious decision or rational choice, Hypergamy is and always has been instinctive compulsion, and therefore will never be eradicated.

Consider the behavior of women in more conservative countries, from Amish communities or those under the rule of sharia law. Hypergamy in women who live under these conditions is greatly suppressed, but not extinguished. In fact it has been shown that these women, given the right circumstances and the confidence that they will get away with it, overcompensate for the lack of outlet for their instinctive compulsions by overindulging. Regardless of the consequences, however severe, burned alive and dowsed with flesh dissolving acid, women still risk it. Take the stigma of Indian women from strict backgrounds who become the campus cum dumpster when they come to Western countries and get a taste of a little freedom. 

You cannot train a scorpion to stop stinging, you could in theory train it to be more docile, more tolerant and less aggressive, but it will sting if it feels  threatened regardless. Because it is within its nature to sting. 

If a child falls into a tiger enclosure at the zoo, do you get mad at the tiger for mauling the child? Most people would blame the tiger, but the tiger is simply fulfilling its natural preditory instinct. Something it has been deprived of in captivity. If you suppress instinct you fight nature itself, and that is a losing battle.

Instead of fighting instinct, it is wiser to learn to understand its mechanism, because once something is understood it can be predicted and exploited.

Hypergamy is mostly, I dare say almost single handedly responsible for the success of our species in terms of evolution and natural selection. Within the confines of modern society it receives a negative classification because like nature, it is ruthless, but it is equally effective as it is ruthless. Modern civil society has changed the game in, that does not mean Hypergamy has no place, it is here to stay, mother nature's laws are absolute, and we cannot fight her.

For millions of years we have fought nature, cursed it, admired it, worshipped it, but what propelled us forward in leaps and bounds was when we studied it. We have acquired dominion over this planet simply by learning to apply the findings of the study of nature to our daily lives, by living within the laws of nature, not against it. By building our world around the laws nature demands, and finding ways to build in accordance to the laws of nature. This has given us success.

I infer that Hypergamy should not only be taught but also respected, it should not be looked down upon. In the sexual market it's women against men, women have always had the advantage in terms of the emotional aspect. Logic is the domain of men, therefore dissection and deconstruction of the hypergamous instinctive compulsion will give men the advantage of prediction.

I would like thoughts and more discussion on this topic in future.",1632141141.0
338,"""She's not happy!"" - The pattern of chronic intrinsic misery that will betaize you and destroy your life if you're not paying attention",319,prg0is,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/prg0is/shes_not_happy_the_pattern_of_chronic_intrinsic/,74,"**TL:DR - You believe her unhappiness is situational and solvable, but it is actually intrinsic misery, which can only be fixed by finding true abundance within.**

# She's never happy

**It's the greatest, deadliest weapon in the female armoury.** 

One that has emasculated and betaized billions of men, and destroyed billions of relationships. The dreaded ""I'm not happy!""

If you haven't experienced it at least once in your life, you probably wouldn't be here. Yes, it's the problem you're going to face sooner or later in your relationships -- she's not happy. She's gonna blame you, guilt trip or shame you -- you feel inadequate. 

Go to YouTube or read any news article - women at every age, every stage of life, in every situation all over the world complain ""I'm not happy!"" And of course ""It's all men's fault!"" 

Strong, independent, empowered, victims! 

You know the usual drill - you talk it out, give up the gym, help out with the chores more, do what she says, you try ""Communication"" (cough, cough), maybe give up those hobbies and passions of yours, maybe propose marriage, get into deep debt to buy that diamond ring, or work two jobs to buy that house, do the blue pill remedies to try and make her happy.

And none of it worked. Now she's unhapppy about the new situation. And the sex and attraction....don't ask.

And wait. It's getting worse. Now she nitpicks at you for every single thing - no matter what you do, no matter how much you wipe her shoes, you're never good enough. Your fate ends in one of the following ways - you live a loveless relationship devoid of respect, or you get cheated on (and maybe find out it started right when she started complaining she's not happy) or you get dumped or much worse, divorced.

Of course, here and on mrp you will of course have to face yourself and see just how much you've contributed to the situation, but there's one subtlety that is rarely spoken about, the devil in the room -- intrinsic misery

# Misery comes in two forms - situational (solvable), and intrinsic (chronic)

Situational miseries are caused by problems that arise purely out of a particular situation. Once identified, the problem can be fixed, the situation may be changed and with that, whatever that made you unhappy is gone and you're back to your good old self. Situational miseries are temporary, fixable, and come and go. 

Intrinsic misery is a whole other game. It arises because of deep seated patterns of negative thinking and feeling, and fundamentally a continuous dissatisfaction and unease with the present moment. It is a lack of honest acceptance and a failure to work through the moment, a constant need to escape elsewhere, fueled by feelings of chronic fear and feelings of lack and neediness. When misery becomes chronic, it becomes an entity of sorts, slowly altering the way you think, feel and even your body chemistry. Think of it as something that wants to survive and grow, and create more misery in some form of the other. It's a void, a black hole within you that eats you away until you are willing to honestly face it for real.

# The biggest lie women and society have told you is that their misery is situational, when it is really intrinsic

This is the basis of most Blue Pilled behavior in us, because we as men are natural problem solvers. We assume by default (and also based on what she says), that the problem is situational and can be fixed by the usual means. What we fail to realize is that misery in women is often far more intrinsic and chronic. And even if it didn't start that way, it goes there soon enough.

Intrinsic misery is caused by something feeling a perpetual lack within oneself. A good test is to take a look at people who seemingly have it all, but are unhappier than ever before. Such people do not possess abundance within themselves. They are extremely needy, get into one sided relationships where they demand it all, but offer little, even to themselves.

Whatever we do not find within ourselves is exactly what we expect others to fill from the outside. We love for our needs - sexual, emotional, companionship, chores, our dreams.

Love that is born out of pure neediness with no element of devotion anywhere is not really loving the other person at all, but just using them to love oneself. **We say ""I love you"", but in reality it's a giant covert contract where the real T&C is ""I actually love me"".**

The most fundamental RP truth is that for the above reason, most love is actually fundamentally dishonest -- and that not only explains most of the behaviour we see, that's also why such ""love"" will never survive the truth down the road. It didn't become dishonest when you were cheated on, or made into an orbiter - **it was dishonest from the very first moment, the whole time**. Eventually the truth just came out. 

Combined with a sense of narcissism, the fine print is ""I am entitled to feel complete, but since I can't find abundance within, or offer it, YOU are going to make me feel complete. Or else my neediness will show its real face"".

In the beginning, the intrinsically miserable person may find themselves over the moon when they fall in love as something (mostly your own hormones) happened to make you forget your constant sense of lack and feel complete -- an escape from the boring reality you've been longing for. However, romance is like a flower and truth is the root of love. Eventually the truth must take root, and that will decide if love lasts or not. Reality soon ensues, and soon your old patterns of pain and resistance to reality are going to come out.

At that point, we all have a choice to look at ourselves and identify the real problem, but most people, especially women, do not. Soon she blames the situation, kids, hormones, your job, the way you do chores, everything on the outside. As the neediness and narcissism emerge, she becomes contemptuous of your failure to make her feel complete. Eventually the misery drives her to a pattern of destructive behavior where she sabotages the relationship and leaves a wrecked man and home one way or another.

You can read many stories like this on other reddits, and on many YT videos dedicated for men these days (SSM, 33 secrets, Better Bachelor, Enterpreneurs in Cars, etc. There're way too many now). Often these women are extremely privileged, life a seemingly perfect life, and yet they destroy it all and then sleep in the bed of misery they've made for themselves. And even therapy can't tell them why.

# Inner misery thrives on the pleasure-pain cycle

Pleasure and pain are in fact the two sides of the same coin -- the two faces of intrinsic, chronic, misery. Pleasure is the nice looking side, pain the overtly horrible looking one. Inner misery utilizes first one, then the other -- and it works both ways.

As an example of pleasure followed by pain, look at the story of Rich Roll (Finding Ultra) - the alcohol first made him feel super good for a while, then it leaves him empty and sick in the morning, and the way these addictions affect your brain is -- they target the parts responsible for feeling hunger and pleasure and create a craving for more. He was able to quit it for good only after clearing the deep seated pain within himself.

As an example of pain followed by pleasure, it's when people may suffer a traumatic event of some sort in their life, and then try to hide or numb the pain - for which food, alcohol, drugs, porn, etc. may temporarily suffice. Another example is the women who have it all, but still feel mysteriously unsatisfied. They then start acting out that misery, increasingly getting dissatisfied, wrecking their lives and relationships, and then suddenly feeling overwhelming guilt and fear and toxic shame.

People who come with low self esteem and self hate may overcompensate by acting overly bold and reckless and dominating in order to feel empowered and may get a kick of ego looking down on others, or may pursue extreme success or do anything to seek attention to feel worthy and be validated by others. This is an example of pain followed by the pleasure. However such an ego is full of fear and hate within, no matter how confident it looks. Such people often have little to offer beyond flaunting what life can take away very quickly, and when they do fall, their actual inner pain and fear is exposed as pathetic.

Others who start from the pain end might end up doing a lot of destructive stuff to themselves and to others, get a sadistic feeling of pleasure in being convinced and justified in their actions, and then once they snap out and realize what they've done - their inner misery then has a field day as they drown in the guilt and misery they've created, hating themselves with toxic shame, and then seeking yet another pleasure outlet by drinking, trying to harm oneself and then enjoying the pain that comes after the chemical cocktail wears off and filling you with even more guilt for the next round.

Either way, it is only inner misery that's having a field day, growing within, using the P-P cycle endlessly to keep itself alive and stopping you from living the life you were actually meant to be.

# Intrinsic Misery is always seeking elsewhere

For ever never here, always rejecting this, forever seeking fulfilment elsewhere is another defining characteristic of deep inner misery. This doesn't arise out of any actual need that's based in reality. It's perpetual dissatisfaction, an addiction to seeking that never allows a stable foundation that can be trusted. You can give it the entire universe, and it will still seek that elusive something that it can't ever put its finger on.

Plenty of rationalizations and justifications can and will be given. Often they find the next hot romantic partner that seems to have made them complete and desired and young again, only to find the same frustrations appearing after some amount of time has passed. Intrinsic misery seeks and seeks and seeks, but never finds.

The grass always looks green on the other side, even if its the same grass on this side. As a result, deeply miserable people will never be able to build relationships of any kind of depth. They will always be seeking the next thrill, the next man or woman, the next happily ever after ending that never comes.

For the simple reason that it was never there, but here.

# Intrinsic Misery will drive you to self sabotage

This type of chronic pain also revels in deep rooted feelings of unworthiness and undeserving of the good abundant things in life. It will then drive you to self sabotaging behaviors, negative belief systems and bad habits, keeping you stuck in destructive patterns and feeding on the misery that ensues as your life falls apart. Your health, career, relationships, finances, integrity and your internal state will all be progressively wrecked by it, and then it enjoys watching you suffer. **The only thing intrinsic misery wants is more pain.**

Whichever end it begins from, in the long run, intrinsic misery will, WILL destroy your life. The truth of your life is the proof of whether you're really happy or really miserable. **Your deepest inner state at your point of origin is what reflects outwardly in your life, and your deeds the witness to your state of being.**

# Outside situations can trigger misery, which then becomes chronic. But fixing the situation won't fix inner pain

Women are half right -- it is possible that situations that exhausted or traumatized them could have affected the way they felt about themselves and you and their relationships. The problem is, **in women, misery becomes chronic with ease.** And it's certainly not helped by the fact that women have a certain collective consciousness of a herd mind that loves company and a poor sense of personal agency and accountability.

That is why fixing the situation fails more often than not -- the problem is now within. And it is going to find a way to make itself miserable in any situation once it goes that deep. You fix the situation, she'll find a new reason to get upset about.

# Intrinsic misery will reduce you to a fraction of the man you can be and suck you in to her misery

Fear, control, misery, toxic shame -- these things are just sapping the life out of you. And it will betaize you into making you do what it wants to keep itself numb to its own pain. **Using every dirty trick in the book, intrinsic misery stops you from living fully**. In the end you will be reduced to far less than what you were before, which in turn kills the attraction even further. You will be miserable living in the shadow of her misery, and that is what the pain body wants, to spread the virus of chronic pain and fear and misery.

# Deadly mental illnesses are advanced forms of intrinsic misery crystallized in the body

Even a normal person is suffering within to some extent. Just as the best way to be healthy is prevention and not cure, so too it is for the mind. Extremely developed forms of intrinsic misery have gone beyond the mind and actually altered the physical brain and body, the way some people are wired --- so the anger problems, Narcissism, Psychopathy, the Bipolar Disorder, Paranoid, Schizophrenia, Suicidal Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, etc etc... by the time you get this far, it is now physically living within these people.

Your best bet is never to get into a relationship with crazy. Or else get out before its too late.

# Intrinsic misery runs on patterns that show up all the time

There is a saying that insanity is doing the same things the same way and expecting different results.

Everything that you call as ""You"" is made up of familiar patterns.

Patterns arise due to memory, and memory drives us into repetitive and rather predictable patterns of behaviour in our relationship. Take damaged women as an example. They keep getting into abusive relationships. Or Nice Guys. Or the Abusers. Many who were abused young end up becoming abusers themselves. Sometimes anger problems and depression run in the genes much like diabetes and heart problems. For better or worse, we seek partners who were similar in many ways to our family growing up.

**The emotional mind runs on patterns. The body runs on genetic patterns and muscle memory. Your actions run on habit. 99% of all the thousands of thoughts and compulsions that cross your mind are repetitive junk.**

It is also why chronically unhappy relationships often run on the same patterns of ""She's not happy"". It's why AWALT is even a thing. It's why her past matters, no matter how much she says she's over it. It's why we say one thing, but default to doing what we always do.

# In boot camp, there's a term called ""Getting smoked"". Women have their own version of it for men they don't like

I think the term ""Getting Smoked"" should be added to the RP glossary, seriously. It's more insidious than shaming tactics.

Ok, for those who don't know and didn't google, it's the ways in which Drill Sergeants in the military keep finding ever new ways to keep punishing you into compliance to break you down. Your DS will find any and every reason to punish you, for those who've been there and seen it. Look up videos on YT and read the comments - they're hilarious in hindsight reads. It's deliberate. They find something wrong all the time, just to find an excuse to make the class pay. Sometimes they'll even do it if nothing was wrong, because they were unhappy they couldn't find someone to punish you know, so you didn't let them do their job...

Sounds familiar? Guess what? Women also use this tactic, more subconsciously, driven by how they feel about you, and much more venomously in relationships. She's never happy and always finds something wrong with you? Well once you've taken a hard look at yourself and eliminated the worst of your sins, maybe you should consider the possibility that you're getting smoked.

**If you ever get smoked by a woman all the time, feel free to assume her hate for you is now chronic and intrinsic and it's only a matter of time.** It is seldom wrong. My BPD ex made my very existence an infraction. I was apologizing for things that never needed an apology and didn't know it then. No DS in their right mind is anything close to the toxic hate of a woman you're close to.

# Compare women who're never happy to spoiled entitled kids

Children who respect and love their parents aren't entitled spoiled brats who always complain about what their parents couldn't provide. The entitled egoistic ones are often needy, intrinsically miserable and never happy no matter how much their parents do or sacrifice for them. But the children who're closest to their parents are those who were set healthy boundaries, understood and accepted their families for who they were, were grateful for whatever they got and loved them beyond those limitations and went beyond neediness to actually reciprocate the love with their own actions. That is completely unknown to the entitled brats.

This kind of love only flows in the direction of giving and needs abundance as a point of origin. No amount of entitlement is going to bring about love and no amount of endless consuming is ever going to give you the satisfaction of a true producer mentality.

**In other words, it's your frame, how you choose to interpret and respond to what happens to you, that decides how happy you will be, and what you will do with your life, far beyond external factors.**

Even after we grow up, this entitlement borne out of neediness can still persist in relationships, with very similar patterns. It's often the partner, the boyfriend, the husband, or even the kids. I mean what's the difference between mom and mother in law? Abundance vs neediness.

The reason I compare women to children is rather obvious. Both are emotion driven and often the emotional patterns can be very similar, with adults adding additional complexities and dimensions, but still the emotional mind runs on pretty much the same principles.

Often this neediness isn't present in her other relationships, but it has somehow (I'm not surprised though) made it's way into yours. Therefore you'll observe that she has no other issues in any of her other relationships, but somehow there's always something wrong with you alone.

So you're not gonna be able to fix her by fueling her entitlements or trying to fix her or trying to fix the situation men. The only solution is for her to fix her frame find abundance within herself and get out of her toxic chronic emotional patterns. Left to herself, doing what she says, trying to please her miserable patterns, she'll just grow her misery until it destroys her life and yours.

# Recognition of intrinsic misery is the beginning of its end, and the beginning of freedom

Your misery doesn't want to be found out -- exposing it to the truth will snap you out of its grip, give you a choice on how you choose to react to it, and ensure its demise like a fan that's just lost its power supply.

Once you are aware of it, it is like being aware of your breathing. You do have a choice, to escape the repeating pain-pleasure patterns and choose another way, a better way of your own conscious making.

Becoming aware of the problem of intrinsic misery with full honesty, having the courage to face inner pain and recognize it for what it is -- acknowledging that this is indeed your responsibility and that you've been doing this to yourself and playing victim all along -- this is really where transformation begins. The only way out is to own your shit.

This is something I began to observe after reading the Power of Now, and over time I've reached a point where I rarely lose my cool even in traffic or when I'm faced with tough situations or even situations where I have no answers. I've been learning to be grateful for the small things we take for granted -- I'm sure Covid would have taught you that you ought to be grateful for just breathing.

# Deep down in your awareness, your intrinsically miserable self is seeking an end

Not that kind of end where you shoot yourself or die of drugs or take a few others with you. Deep down you know that you're more than just a hole of neediness and misery. The call for dying is really a call to come back to life as what you truly were meant to be.

The only kind of death you need is when your intrinsic misery that has become you is exposed and recognized for what it is and meets a natural end in the light of your abundance. There is no need to try the tragic stuff -- **just recognize that the only thing that wants to die is the pain. And that is all you need to come back to life.**

# Real happiness is about how you are on the inside and what kind of frame you use to handle the outside

I have seen people completely unhappy despite being surrounded by lavish first world privileges that people in poor parts of the world would die for and be grateful for a fraction of such facilities. I have seen many poor places where people are grateful for the smallest things. I have met the happiest smiles in infants and young children, who have nothing but their own joy. Especially infants. They give joy to others without even trying, simply by being blissful themselves. They pull others into their emotional frames just so easily, right? 

That is natural state of abundance. It is the very opposite of chronic neediness. Possessing inner wealth that cannot be bought or filled up from the outside. 

In contrast, neediness is an addiction - it is never fulfilled, wants more and more while being satisfies less and less and only leaves you more miserable in the end, because **that which originates from deep intrinsic pain, only wants more pain and will only create more pain in the end.**

It all comes down to how you are on the inside - physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. And what kind of frame you've being using to face the outside. The people who're never happy live in their own stories in their own heads, never grateful for anything and never having anything of abundance to offer.

# When you're faced with intrinsic misery, your road ahead is gonna be hard and the solution only ever lies within you

Face it, you're up against a force of nature that isn't going to be solved by the usual problem solving BP solutions. Even most therapists might refuse to recognize that this kind of deep rooted misery is a thing. But left unchecked, this is going to destroy your hard earned life. She won't really know what she's doing or saying -- and even if she does, if she let it slip down this far, she probably doesn't have the awareness or accountability or the will to face herself. Emotions and patterns are going to trounce logic.

Your only route forward when faced with intrinsic misery is to turn back towards finding abundance within yourself. You must take responsibility for loving and respecting yourself. You must set the emotional frame and set healthy boundaries and not hesitate to call out what is really going on. You must slowly take back your power step by step and reset the point of origin to yourself.

**In a way, the entire RP journey to being the best version of yourself, the man you are capable of being, is also a journey out of inner pain.** At this point, you know what to do -- bazillions of posts, articles, books, videos and threads here and mrp have already told you all you need to know. And an ounce of experience will teach you a lot more.

Your relationship is either going to be a case of you caving in to her eternally miserable ever changing frame, leaving you like a ball bouncing between two opposite facing walls with ""I'M NOT HAPPY"" written in big bold letters, or else you take control over yourself.

Then the relationship will either eventually break down into your frame and recover, or it's going to bounce off your frame and end. If she's too keen to sink into darkness, the least you could do is not to let her take you with her. Either you transform it by transforming yourself, or put it out of its misery.

Both aren't the easy way out.

# Just as neediness looks to the outside to fill up the hole within itself, abundance looks inward to find the creator within where the world cannot offer it

Your only choice when faced with a powerful case of deep intrinsic misery is to turn back to yourself. Now only you are the solution. Those 12 levels of dread (yeah covert contract) ? Really its 12 stages of reclaiming yourself, going back to the man you were, or becoming that man you weren't ever. You bring the point of origin back to you, build your power, become authentically what you were meant to be.

Think about it, where were we just a few tens of thousands of years ago in the Stone Age? We're not the strongest or the fastest, we don't have the sharpest senses, our infants are helpless. How did we make all this progress? Ok, just a few years ago you were Billy Beta, scorned, dumped, disrespected. How did you turn it around?

We found the creative energy within and brought abundance into our lives where none existed. Neediness and intrinsic misery stop us from knowing who we truly are and what we can do, but once we get out of their grip, everything begins to change. **One can very quickly move on to a much better, more conscious, and truly joyful life if one is able to free themselves out of the pain-pleasure cycle.**

And if she has any amount of self awareness left, eventually she'll have to realize she needs to get out of neediness, her own pain-pleasure addictions, hold herself accountable, take responsibility for loving herself truthfully, and find some abundance within herself, or else she isn't gonna bring anything positive to the relationship.

As you grow in your power, it is a threat to her patterns of misery and it is indeed the naked uncensored core of pure fear and misery -- what has really been hiding within her that comes out during the main event, when it can't cover itself up any more. If she can't, eventually your own growth will make it clear that a toxic miserable relationship has no more business in your life and is only a liability, and out is the only way, even if it means having to renounce your old life and all you built, behind.",1632083971.0
339,How The Pump And Dump Is Ruining Your Sex Life,169,prbalr,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/prbalr/how_the_pump_and_dump_is_ruining_your_sex_life/,78,"There's a saying in sales and Internet Marketing.  You are not interested in getting a sale but a repeat customer.  What that means in dating is, you don't want to just fuck, you want to have a recurring sexual relationship with women.

Some of you are getting with women who are not worthy of your dick, that's why you feel the need to pump and dump.  What this does to your mind is tell you that women aren't worth anything but one-night stands.  The real fun begins when the woman trusts you to the point that she will do kinky shit with you, like BDSM or fetishes the both of you enjoy but too shy to let other people know.

With all the porn that you've seen over your lifetime you have tons of ideas to make the sex better.  Sometimes you don't want to do certain sexual acts with certain women because you really don't want to fuck with them like that.  In my opinion, only deal with women you want to have a recurring sexual relationship with.  Don't bring out the chocolate sauce and whipped cream for a chick you have no interest in fucking another day.  Doing something like this will lead her on.

Something else the pump and dump does is give you a bad rep.  A lot of men just want to bust that nut as quickly as possible, not giving a fuck if the woman got hers.  Well if you were a ""one-minute man"", and you happen to approach her hot friend, she's gonna tell her friend you were the ""one-pump chump"".  When you build solid sexual relationships with women, you may build up a good rep.

*I remember one time I went to one of the bars in my area by myself.  I met the friend of a friend of a woman I fucked during that time.  I approached her, told her my name, and she said, ""Oh, I heard about you"" and asked me if I knew the girl who I was fucking.  This girl had a boyfriend, but this doesn't take away the fact that women talk, so you want the things they say about you to be good things.*

I said that not to pat myself on the back.  I said that to let you know that you may approach the friend of a friend of a woman you use to fuck.  If she's heard good things about you, she may want to see if everything that was said about you is true.

Another good thing about building recurring sexual relationships is you know you don't need to go on a date and hope that you'll have sex at the end of the night.  You can either fuck your fuck buddy and then go on a date with the other chick or go on a date with the other chick and fuck your fuck buddy right after.  When you're not thirsty to get sex from a new chick, you seem more calm and relaxed.  If the woman misbehaves, you're quicker to check her bad behavior.  At the end of the night, if she doesn't invite you in for sex at the end of the night, it's cool.  You either already fucked or gonna fuck someone else after your date.  This is a good way to play the long game with a woman you're interested in.  You're patient because your sexual needs are already being met. There will come a time when she can't resist your charms that she finally gives in, meanwhile you were cool and patient about not having sex with this woman the whole time because your sexual needs were already met.

""Sex is never worth the wait""

And that's true.  This is why you're fucking while you're getting to know this chick.  Once you have sex with this new chick, she might not be able to get enough.  I don't suggest showering this woman with your attention.  There are women we want to get with, but they may have a boyfriend at the moment.  Instead of trying to break them up, you're fucking other women.  When she breaks up with her boyfriend, she may be available to get the dick.

340,Seeing people die,1115,pq4tkq,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pq4tkq/seeing_people_die/,181,"I don't really know where to begin. I work as a firefighter for 2 years, got on at 24, now I'm 26 years old. I've seen a lot of bad things happen. I've seen a lot of people die in just 2 years of my career so far. It's one thing to see it on the movies ""woah! Look at his head split open!"" Or playing video games ""dude did you see that thing explode?!"" But once you actually see a dead body, watch someone die in your hands.. it kills a part of you. 

You come home after trying to cut a man down from a tree because he hung himself, you do your job, knowing he's already dead, you still try, and your family asks you ""how was your day?"" You respond ""today was great! You know the usual."" 

When you read about male suicide statistics and how suicide is the top 10 killer of men. It's true. I've seen 2 hangings and 1 gun shot wound to the head, all of them were men just from last year. 

I probably have PTSD. I haven't spoken to a therapist and I don't want to. I don't talk about these things. You might ask why don't you talk about it? I don't know.. just.. people don't understand, you know? They might judge me, tell me to man up, or say ""other people have it worse."" Sometimes my mom would tell me ""just let it go."" I wish it were that easy. I wish I could make the nightmares go away and the aniexty to disappear. She doesn't understand. A lot of people don't. 

When you spend 30 mins performing cpr on someone's father. You're doing everything you can, their family is waiting across the street, you know he's dead already but you keep going.. the call is made. You stop. You tell the wife ""I'm sorry for your loss.."", you see in her eyes how her world is falling apart. You get in the truck, exhausted, take a deep breath, trying to keep your composure together. You see the mother walking her sons over to the house. Lost their father at 40. 

We men don't talk about how things don't bother us but they do. Deep within us, a wound bleeds. We eat, drink, do drugs, jerk off to porn. Act out. Fight. Arguments. Just so we don't have to face the guilt within us. It festers and cuts deeper within our soul until we become a broken shell of a human being. Than... boom.. suicide. 

I thought about killing myself a lot the last couple of months. I would stay up all night long, can't sleep, anixety through the roof. Thinking about the people that died, how I'm sorry I couldn't save them, just.. guilty. I was trained to save lives and.. all you can do is do your best. 

The Redpill gave me hope that my life will get better. For a long time I thought I was trapped.. that my life would never get better. That I had no control over my life. The nightmares and anxiety would never stop. That I was fucked forever. 

Than I realized the only thing I can control is me. I stopped abusing the drugs, stopped drinking to escape, stopped eating junk food, stopped jerking off to porn. I stopped numbing myself. I faced my demons, I faced the truth. The truth is I did everything I could, I did my job, and I should be proud. The next time something bad happens, I wanna be there because I have the experience to help those that need it. I know I'm gonna see worst things further in my career and I wanna be there. 

I didn't let the guilt bury me, I didn't let the nightmares haunt me, I didn't let the anixety overwhelm me. I conquered myself. I'm proud of myself. 

This is what it means to be a Man. To struggle, to endure, to survive, to fight and win your life! 

There's some bad days and there's some good days. Lifting has become my therapy. Nothing is better than to feel the iron around your hands and your muscles swollen after a good workout. 

I just wanna say thank you to this community for giving me hope. In a world where men don't have a voice. Thank you for being here. You saved a lot of lives and mine included. I want to contribute to this community and transform my life as an example to all Men, life does get better.",1631900217.0
341,Meeting Women: RPS's Definitive Guide to Captive Audiences,92,pq2obw,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pq2obw/meeting_women_rpss_definitive_guide_to_captive/,21,"**The Captive Audience**

Where do you meet women? It's almost more important than talking about what to do when you *do* meet a woman. What good is game if you can't even get an introduction? 

The new world of online dating apps have subjected women to an onslaught of infinite peen with little to no effort aside from a swipe left or right. New apps bring new tricks and gimmicks to subvert the problem that abundance creates: In a world of infinite choices, no choice is the best choice. And women demonstrate this fact thoroughly- in person and online. What need does a hot ""asset"" have for any of you when she has thousands of followers on her instagram that drool every time she takes a cleavage selfie? What could any of you possibly offer her that all you don't collectively already give her?

Well, of course in the spirit of human connection and intimacy, this online facsimile of a social life will only bring a woman so far. While it clouds her judgment and prevents her from making good, solid decisions, it will not bring her any long-term happiness and she is acutely aware of this. Like the fat person eating junk food, he knows it will make him fatter, but he cannot resist the empty calories of sugar and carbs.

Though all of this is ultimately a numbers game, there are ways to put your thumb on the scale in your favor by getting ahead of the trends and thinking *smarter, not harder*.

The online opener gambit is really only effective if you’ve got top tier looks and fitness. A picture of you shirtless will clean up better than any quip or clever one-liner ever could. But since this sub is about strategy, let’s assume that you are already working on appearances and you’re ready for the next step. How do you separate yourself from the other chodes on the online meat market? 

The only winning move is not to play. Your real avenue to success lies in a topic rarely discussed on TheRedPill: 

# Building rapport via captive audience

Before anybody gets their panties in a twist, I am not suggesting that you kidnap women and keep them in your basement. Though you might be considering dark triad’s Stockholm play based on the title of this essay, I do not recommend it as becoming a fugitive for pussy is hardly worth the price of admission. (I joke, but seriously, don't do this)

Getting a captive audience is the key to lowering the barriers of women around you. It offers an excuse for interaction and their participation in rapport building, and allows you extra time to work your charm that you wouldn’t normally get with a one-liner at a club or a sassy bio on tinder.

## What is a captive audience? 

A captive audience is a unique social environment in which interaction is not only expected but potentially required by norm or rule. The hallmark of a captive audience is that you have implicit permission to interact and a longer window for which the interaction can take place.

Because of this extended exposure time, you are much more likely to build rapport and ultimately utilize your entire toolkit to attract a mate. Whereas a club or online requires a very strong opener and immediate sexual attraction, longer exposures with fewer expectations allows you to use humor, game, and charm to build the same types of attraction to lower a woman’s barrier, without relying as heavily on looks.

Women keep the barrier up, even against men they would potentially end up with, as a means to sort out the weak and unworthy. It is on men to be creative on how to bypass the barrier. Obviously, immediate physicality is quickest way to lower the barrier, but as many here can attest, regardless of strength, not everybody was blessed with the best genes or most fortunate mug.

## What are some good examples of captive audiences that you can exploit?

**Coworkers**

The first, most obvious captive audience is your job or workplace. One of the most common places couples meet is work. Depending on the type of job, you may spend hours a day with some hot potentials, opening the door to working your charm, and building rapport over the course of days, or even weeks. Be careful about not going *too slow* with this captive audience. Women like *new* things. You can talk yourself out of sale just as easily as talking yourself into one. 

While the work environment gives you the most breathing room, you must maintain some level of sexual pretense to your interactions from a very early stage to prevent lack of interest. You must also be very careful not to cross into sexual harassment territory. Keep your jokes light but intriguing and remain overtly un-sexual until she agrees to drinks off the clock.

**Customers**

The next one is probably my favorite type of captive audience because it brings you a new, fresh selection on a regular basis: Flirting with your customers. Be it a bartending job, get a gig as a DJ or bouncer, or even a waiter at a restaurant, if you’ve got charisma, then you’ve got approximately an hour window to work your magic on a never ending river of pussy.

It’s a smaller window but the time-constraint ensures you take more risks and the downsides to a crash and burn are much smaller, as there will be a new selection in minutes.  Be charismatic and charming when interacting with customers. If for no other reason than to get social skills practice. These environments are best when you keep it light and silly, but also allows you to introduce overt sexual tones to the conversation early. 

Bartending is my favorite because you can title drinks with dirty names as an opener for overt sexual talk. Most women with at least one drink in them will engage in that conversation. They may work the room but ultimately you’re going to be the man they talk to the most. And what’s best is while they’re giving every other dude the cold shoulder, they’re giving you express permission to flirt with them as you expertly craft their drink.

## Bartending gets RedPillSchool’s stamp of approval as the best captive audience of all time.

**Friends/Parties**

Over the years I’ve been to and hosted a number of house parties and I’ve come to a conclusion. Unless you’re extremely popular or outgoing, going to somebody else’s party is a crapshoot for getting laid.

However, hosting your own party is a different game entirely. The massive fucking social proof of having tons of people in your place at a party you’re hosting is an unbelievable aphrodisiac. As long as your party isn’t a total sausage fest, and you’ve got 15+ people and good music, you are going to clean up hard.

Women at parties are just as good at cold shouldering as any other social gathering. But as the host, you are in a unique position to not only talk to everybody who enters your house, but to offer hospitality and demonstrate your charisma. When new guests arrive, introduce yourself. Hug everyone who comes in. Introduce physicality early, and walk new guests to the drinks and pour something for you and the new guests to enjoy together as a way of welcoming them. They will feel instantly at home, and now you’ve got a leg up on conversation with the new guests before they’ve had a chance to mingle.

The party is a great way to speed-run building rapport, because as people mingle and bump into each other in different rooms at different times with different people and music, it feels like more time has passed and familiarity seems to increase quicker when changes of scenery occur. Very strong bonds with both women and men can be created at a decent house party. Use these tips to your advantage.

**Conclusion**

These are just a small handful of captive audiences that you can exploit. But this list is not exhaustive. There are plenty of other places to meet people: school, classes, volunteer programs, festivals, hobby groups, exercise groups, etc. Use your imagination and play to your strengths when deciding how you can best utilize a captive audience. Throwing a house party might not be in the cards for you if you’re new in a city with very few friends. But if you decide to bar tend for a few months, you can likely work that friends list up considerably.

If you're still in highschool, now is your opportunity to start approaching. Do it while you have the time. Your network will serve you for years to come, long after highschool is over.

What are some other captive audiences you can think of? What strengths do they serve best? Discuss.",1631893590.0
342,A talk with my mom last night.,253,ppooj9,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ppooj9/a_talk_with_my_mom_last_night/,98,"*My mom and I have the house to ourselves for a while since both my dad and brother are out of town.*

My mom and I have always had an up and down relationship. 

The crux of our issues was that she was a very overbearing parent. Not only did she naturally have a loud voice, but she used it. She spoke very direct and cutthroat, like an old school football coach would do. If you weren't doing something right, she would tell you in simple plain English, no sugar coat, no protecting your feelings, no holds barred.  

Of course, this style of parenting made me dislike her. 

When you pair a classic nice guy beta blue-pilled screen addicted weak boy (me, ages 8-22, I'm 23 now) with an honest, truth telling, tough, and sharp person (my mom), the former starts to resent the latter.

In recent years, the relationship has been more on the up and up due to my own maturation, time, and honestly a couple red pills I had to swallow, but that doesn't take away from the fact that for a large period of my life, my mom and I have been at odds. 

After our talk last night, along with the hours of self eval and thinking I've been doing over a few months, I realized why she had to be how she was

# The reason is because my dad showed no leadership during my childhood.

As part of my masculine journey I have been reading many books, and in two of them ([here](https://www.amazon.com/No-More-Mr-Nice-Guy/dp/0762415339/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1631689156&sr=8-1) and [here](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Times-Create-Strong-Men/dp/1949572056/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1631689189&sr=8-1)) it talks about how absent fathers are a big problem for today's young men, and have been for two generations (sine 1950-ish) now. 

My dad may have been financially and physically present in the home, but as far as being there and RAISING ME, DISCIPLINING ME, GUIDING ME, he was not. 

He was off in his own world. 

Most of his idle time was spend in front of the TV or smoking cigarettes. He made good money and provided us with vacations, two properties, and all that stuff, but his lack of PARENTING forced my mom into the overbearing role. 

**It's almost as if my mom had to be double aggressive and double strict, to make up for my dad's lack of leadership.**

Below are some points of my conversation with my mom, where these ideas were talked about:

* My dad was this way because *HIS* dad (born 1940) was this way too
   * this ""father stays aloof, mother takes the lead"" style of parenting is all he knows, so he followed that style too
* My mom said sometimes she felt like a single mother, despite having a high earning husband in the home
* My mom said she was originally not an aggressive, overbearing person but her need to step into the leadership role with no backup made her that way
* My mom said my dad was a typical ""nice guy""
   * No backbone, no opinion of his own, gets carried away by whatever he hears from others (including his kids!)

# ""But u/red_blood_cells, what does this have to do with me? I'm not a dad, I'm only twenty-something. I don't care about kids, I just want to spin plates.""

Because masculinity and leadership applies to **both parenting and dating.**

Females want men to be masculine and take the lead, **both when being a dad to your kids, and being her daddy in bed**

**She wants you to be masculine so she can be feminine.** 

She may start out as a sexy submissive babe who loved bending over for you and letting you bury yourself deep into her wetness, but if you stop leading the way and get lazy, she will be less feminine and more masculine. If you don't lead, she will be forced into that role when she doesn't want it. 

She doesn't want to pick the restaurant, she doesn't want to plan the trip, she doesn't want to pick up the check or split the bill. She doesn't want to tell you what shirt looks better on you, she wants *you* to know where to eat, where to go, and what to wear.

It's like a power vacuum in war. If there is no powerful ruler, you get a power vacuum, and other groups come to fill that vacuum (Iraq 2003, Afghanistan 2021). 

You are the powerful ruler. You failing to take the lead creates a vacuum, she is the 'other group' filling the vacuum. 

She won't be attracted to you being lazy, you won't be attracted to her being assertive. 

Attraction stops, sex decreases, resentment increases, and you become like every other average couple that does more fantasizing about others and less fucking, let alone cheating

I'll finish this long winded but hopefully high quality post with two points, one declaration and one thought exercise:

* **declaration:** Be a MAN. Be a LEADER. Take a STAND. LEAD trips, LEAD dates, be in charge not in a controlling way, but in a controlled way
* **thought exercise:** Think about your family. Ask yourself whether one of them was too over/under bearing, and ask yourself why. 
   * Trace back some roots, think about your own childhood and if/how family relations affected it. 
   * Something from your childhood or family could be locking you into self-sabotage type behavior and holding you back",1631835109.0
343,The Best Advice I've Gotten From This Subreddit,656,pp43kf,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pp43kf/the_best_advice_ive_gotten_from_this_subreddit/,50,"I've always felt that my life had a path. I know that there was a certain direction I had to take but my young mind was always preoccupied with bullshit high school drama and teen angst. Stumbling upon TRP was one of the best choices I've ever come to. Especially coming across this piece of advice:

""A man's life is on hard mode. Nobody has your back except yourself.""

The power behind these two sentences delivers remarkable confidence to me. There are some days I feel like crap. Days where I don't want to do anything but go on my phone and browse useless media and eye candy. That is when this quote comes into my mind. I know that if I keep fucking around, I'll end up in a shit hole doing nothing good for nobody -- especially myself. I'm not here to waste my life. I'm here to puff my chest and deal with whatever life has to throw at me to make myself the best version of myself. Chin up boys. We're men and we gotta show ourselves that we're capable of anything. Nobody will help you except yourself so lace up those bootstraps and get back to being your best.",1631757673.0

What ever happened to this once great nation of ours? Whatever happened to pulling a nerd's underpants up over his head? What happened to blaring Lynyrd Skynyrd and doing doughnuts in the school parking lot after the game?  And when was the last time a drag show was still about cars?


I'll tell you what, there's been a lot of division in this country. Don't know when it started. Maybe it started back when the chosen people chose to put thermite in them towers. Or maybe it was when Barack Hussein Obama made a man be the first lady. All I know is things just ain't what they used to be.


With everything that's been going on, I thought I would remind you boys what this country is really about. America was founded on unity, more specifically on uniting Americans and Africans in the 1700's. Uniting with Africans is a time honored  tradition followed by esteemed Americans like Thomas Jefferson, Bill Clinton and most recently Kim Kardashian. 


When I say I enjoy some good racing I ain't talking about Nascar. I know not everyone here shares my taste. I understand that and I appreciate that we can have differences of opinion in what's left of a democratic society. Just keep your goddamn segregationism, racism and communism, to yourself. Ok? That kind of tomfoolery goes against everything this country was built on! If it weren't for strong and uppity black women like Rosa Parks riding the bus in Montgomery Alabama, there wouldn't be strong black women riding grandpa Glen! Last thing we need here is a bunch of Jim Crows pushing lady liberty down the stairs when she's old and frail. If this country is gonna make it, it's about time you youngsters overcome your prejudices and learn to appreciate women of color.


Don't get things confused. I'm specific with my standards, meticulous with my mud-sharking, and explicit with my expectations. When you've been around the block as many times as I have, not just any Harlem Hussy will do. If you want to be good at this game you need to get in the right headspace. You need to start thinking like a football scout or an American agriculturalist standing on the dock of Charleston harbor. You have to have an eye for talent and know what it is you're looking for. Let me tell you that what you're after is a woman with bright white healthy teeth that shine like the June moon in the black Alabama sky. She needs to have strong haunches, be quick on her feet and have a keen entrepreneurial spirit.


Now Grandpa Glen got this game all figured out. Saddled up in the Buick, prowling the urban jungle on the lookout for my next Sub-Saharan Sweetheart, I have an eagle's eye for what my heart desires. Call me a honky all you want, it doesn't bother me. It's just my way of communicating with the city's ladies. Grandpa Glen doesn't have to say much cuz his car composes the pick up lines. I just pull the car over to the side, roll down the window and hit my Bronx Bombshell with these crystal blue eyes. They hop right in they're so excited. Half the time they even forget to negotiate. Just a simple sensual drive-through no different than a fast food restaurant, and what's more American than that?

Once she's inside for a ride I cut right to business. You see, I'm a real patriot. I like to introduce my Mali mama to some of the greatest men to ever live in Americana. Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln and sometimes even Benjamin Franklin, if I'm feeling generous. Call me a philanthropist. I like to give back to the black community. After all it was they that built this country. Least I could do is show my appreciation by giving them a donation. For me this is more than a business transaction, it's a whole way of life, like sweet sticky dark molasses on my white rice.",1631805937.0

The high quality content of this Red Pill manosphere, which I have been reading and internalizing via  this sub, a few books I've read ([here](https://www.amazon.com/No-More-Mr-Nice-Guy/dp/0762415339/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1631689156&sr=8-1), [here](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Times-Create-Strong-Men/dp/1949572056/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1631689189&sr=8-1), and [here](https://www.amazon.com/Rational-Male-Rollo-Tomassi/dp/1492777862/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1GK8B9G5GXD0Z&dchild=1&keywords=the+rational+male&qid=1631689211&sr=8-1)), two Youtube channels ([here](https://www.youtube.com/c/FITXFEARLESS) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/elliottsaidwhat)), anda podcast ([here](https://open.spotify.com/show/00lVjGbsJEkJoyToQtkc7m?si=964SqwUFRwSSh1QFPp4K0w&dl_branch=1)) has been awesome for me.

I won't bore you with the details, but if I were to summarize it in one phrase, I feel this has helped me **get in touch with my masculinity**. This, for someone who has a history of low self esteem, pedestalizing women, nice guy syndrome, and volatile emotions, has been a game changer.

However, there is one big point I'm sure has been talked about here before but I would like to say it for myself:

# At some point, you have to do less reading of TRP material and do more of implementing TRP material.

# You have to build your world.

Red Pill can't be your identity. It can be your guide, it can be your philosophy as to how you live your life and how you conduct yourself, it can be something you turn to when you are in doubt and don't know what decision to take. But it can't be your identity.

When you have dinner with your new and improved friends that your new mindset had created for you, you won't be talking about red pill

When you have a post fuck pillow talk with your plate, you won't be talking about red pill

When your family members comment on how good you look, how confident you are, how mature you have become, you won't be talking about red pill

Your world is **SOMETHING THAT** **YOU** **DO AND SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT**

Red Pill just encourages you to get there and build a world, but Red Pill can't be your world.

**BUILDING A WORLD BUILDS YOUR IDENTITY**, and **THOSE** are things that make you interesting and likable to fellow males and attractive to women:

&#x200B;

* Your career, job, professional goals, showing you like to WORK
   * Working hard and being ambitious is masculine. Feminine women like masculine males
* Your friend group
* Your 1-2 hobbies that you go deep into and the additional friends that come out of that
   * ideally you should have both physical and non physical activities here (basketball, poker, wine night, hiking, whatever)
* A business or side hustle you are working on getting off the ground
* Books or genres you like (non red pill material)
* Having certain establishments you know, like and are comfortable in
   * If you are dating, you should have restaurants/bars/clubs you have been to so you can take her and lead her into your world
      * Fun activities you can turn into a date/hangout like darts at a bar, bar-cade, sporting event, show, etc
* Family life and connections if applicable

**When interacting with men:**

* Having a well built world makes you interesting, competent, respect-worthy, and multi dimensional.
* Other men will like you and want to be your friend, might want to see more of your world

**When interacting with women and dating:**

* Having a well built world makes you interesting, competent, respect-worthy, and multi dimensional, just like above.
* It gives you things to give attention/time/effort towards that are not her
   * this makes her want you more because you aren't always drooling over her.
* It fulfills the human needs you have (respect, validation, feeling needed) without relying on her
   * this also makes her want you more because you aren't always drooling over her
* It showcases that she is #5 or lower on your priority list
   * which is where she secretly wants to be. if you put her top 3, she will not respect you

**Build a world you love living in every day, and you will attract not only high quality women as romantic/sexual interests, but also high quality men as friends. I'd argue the latter is more important, but that's a post for another day.**",1631689824.0

348,Cold Approach Discussion,77,pn5wyg,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pn5wyg/cold_approach_discussion/,36,"I've done a 'round table discussion' with a kickass group of guys who have all done a tonne of cold approaching and gotten laid from it. In it  we cover a bunch of things including:   


* How to start approaching 
* Does approaching make you a better man? 
* Cold approach vs Tinder 

It's an awesome discussion with some funny stories thrown in there. Without watching, the main takeaways from talking to pretty experienced guys are:  


* You need to play the number's game. All the little things you can do with body language, jokes, saying lines or the tonality of your voice don't really matter. YOU need to go out there, try a bunch of things and see what works for you. 
* At the end of the day, approaching isn't as scary as it seems. Most girls are pretty nice and the worst case scenario is that a girl is a bitch. The more you do it, the easier it gets and you realise that even after negative reactions, the world keeps turning. 
* You can make all the excuses in the world, you can waste your time mentally masturbating, but at the end of the day you can't think yourself out of taking action. If you want to get laid  - approaching is one of the best ways to do that. 
* Even if you're not at the point where you look good, START NOW. There's almost no reason not to start now. Even if you're not ready, approaching now will help you: build momentum, get used to rejection, work on your approach anxiety and very importantly, it makes you feel like a man. It feels really fucking good knowing that you're doing something ***a majority*** of men can't do. 
* Sometimes it's not glamorous, you'll get nervous, you'll have days where you don't want to, you'll have periods where you'll do a bunch of approaches with no success. Sometimes it sucks but that's part of the process. **If you never quit**, you'll eventually find success. 

If you haven't got the point,  these guys and I advocate approaching. So if it's something you struggle with or have been thinking about, give the video a watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc--7fBEhoY).

349,Nofap changed my mentality in a week,392,pmqjdy,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pmqjdy/nofap_changed_my_mentality_in_a_week/,164,"Some believe in Nofap, some don’t. I personally notice changes when I’m on nofap after about a week. Those that would see the most benefits are those that jack off and watch porn at least daily. Here are the things I’ve noticed after a week.

**Changes in Energy**

Libido is your lust, and also your lust for life. When you’re not PMOing all the time, you have more energy for your life. I noticed when I would PMO a lot, I would sleep in and generally be content with shit food and doing nothing. This definitely changes. Getting up earlier and seizing the day becomes a lot easier on Nofap. 

I was also content with getting no pussy on PMO. Ive heard that the brain can’t differentiate between porn and real women so you feel very satisfied when you watch Sasha Grey cop anal, because your brain thinks YOU fucked her in the ass. Without this you are forced to get out and look for sexual opportunities. I’ve been on one good date in the last week that I will probably bone soon and am talking to another chick which I will soon date. Of course, this requires more effort but it’s real.

**Psychology**

The big psychological component around porn is shame. Some experience this and some don’t. I did. At the back of your mind you feel like a loser when you’re watching women that you can’t get in real life get railed by some huge cocked dude and blowing your load on your stomach. This shame shows through. When this shame isn’t present, you are more open and enthusiastic, with a healthier self esteem. Also, the self discipline to have control over an addiction leads to another little boost in your self esteem. Both the lack of shame and the achievement of self control do wonders for your self image.

**Sexual Power Dynamic**

When you are a porn watcher (addict) you pedestalise women. Specifically, there is a bowing to the power of women’s beauty due to the compulsive habit of watching porn and jacking off and the reliance on porn for orgasm. You are not able to get your needs met through your own means. This lack of ability to get real women and the compulsive addiction leads men to become submissive to the power of women’s beauty in the real world. They know from habit that if they give up, and fire up the browser they will receive pleasure. This is not how real seduction works. A woman wants to feel a strong man who can be in possession of himself and his sexuality, especially in the initial meeting.

When you go a while without porn, masturbation and orgasm (PMO) you realise that you can be in control of your sexuality and sexual release becomes a conscious choice, not an addictive compulsion, so women’s beauty in the real world becomes less powerful over you. You can “take it or leave it”. Sure, you will still look at - and maybe flirt with - hot women but it won’t be compulsive and needy. 

Therefore, on Nofap there is a healthy distance between you and the power of a hot female; a mental distance that promotes calm. This distance is necessary to successfully seduce a woman because she will feel it if you are easily under her power and are needy. Essentially, you have taken the power of your sexuality back.

**Changes in How You See Women**

After a week of no PMO, I went back to my favourite porn haunts (social media thots - free onlyfans content) and I saw the same women different to how I did before. I could see they were just little girls; some goofy, some cute, some soulless. It was as if I saw myself above them.

Before, I was transfixed, under their power and could only see a surface representation (kind of like how you see celebrities - as in “they’re better than me”). Now I felt like I could see the whole person. Don’t get me wrong, I still loved their bodies, but I could see deeper to them as an individual. This is of course helpful when talking to women in real life because you’re not transfixed and can vet them properly, not being overpowered by their surface level beauty. As has been said before on TRP “ignore their beauty” - this is much easier on Nofap. This is great for teasing, humour, conversing etc as well, because you can tease her properly - in an individualised way.

**Conclusion**

With boosts to your sexual power, benefits in how you see women, improvements in your energy and your self esteem and psychology, Nofap is worth trying for at least a week to see how you feel. This is of course my personal experience and not backed by science but if it is a placebo, I’d take that shit every day of the week.

350,Two types,60,pmebi8,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pmebi8/two_types/,7,"At the end of the day, in your reality, there are only two types of people in this world. People who ARE valuable to you and people who are NOT. Sounds simple but I'm sure you forget from time to time.  Sure people in category one, to you, may have different levels of value but they are still valuable. (Your friends, your family, your romantic interests, your peers/coworkers, your work superiors, your subordinates, your neighbors, your religious group, etc.). What keeps them in category one is a healthy relationship with healthy boundaries, growth and mutual benefit (or even a means to an end).  When a relationship (of any kind) starts to become unhealthy its important not to become emotional or removed from your center but simply put them in category two without malice. Is no different than reading a news article about a random person in a foreign city or country that has some hardship. You wish that person a well life but they aren't that valuable to your life. Put that same feeling towards people with bad energy and you will reach mental peace. You will no longer harbor any anger or hate towards anyone once you fully master that (it takes practice). If someone is able to push you off center and you keep them around its because they are valuable to you on some level. Depending on the circumstances you might be a masochist. Unless that's your thing I suggest you distill the people in your life and keep those you really care about. Its your job to reach a level of success that you only have people in category one around you and avoid the pitfalls that can force category two people to have a permanent or semi-permanent position. It may very well be that you need to pick your life up, smash it to pieces, and get a whole new environment/ move to a new city.  Find your tribe. Treat them well and dont worry about the rest.",1631390449.0
351,1 Approach a Day,254,plb9a1,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/plb9a1/1_approach_a_day/,83,"Recently my mate and I started a small daily habit – **hitting on 1 girl a day.** It’s an everyday rule – we aren’t allowed to go to sleep until we’ve done our 1 approach for the day, no exceptions.

I’ve done this 1-a-day habit in the past for about 6 months straight, and it was life-changing. Talking to girls became effortless – as easy as tying my shoelaces. I got laid 7 times, and it took almost no time or energy out of my day – barely a 2 minute conversation with a girl every day (or less than 10 seconds if she’s not interested).

Back then, I desperately needed this daily habit of hitting on girls – I was unconfident and had to force myself to talk to any girls. I’d only had sex from online dating, and hitting on girls in person during the day was a huge mountain for me to climb.

The daily habit broke it down into a smaller, more achievable goal – instead of “go out and talk to a tonne of girls and get laid”, it was “just go up to *one* girl every day, talk to her for a minute and ask for her number”.

This time around, it’s only been 4 days since starting the 1-a-day habit, and I already have a date lined up with a chick I met 2 days ago. By instituting a small daily habit – something you can easily keep up no matter what – you’re taking one baby step towards success every single day. Over time those hundreds of little baby steps add up, compounding into a massive win. **You’re winning a war against your biggest challenges, one seemingly-insignificant little victory at a time.**

Talking to 1 girl a day means you’ll talk to 365 girls in a year. That’s enough for even a total newbie with anxiety to get laid with 3-5 new girls, without much effort at all. You’re literally just saying hi to one girl a day and asking for a number.

You don’t have to have a long conversation – I never do. When I hit on girls, it’s 1 minute max (unless we *really* hit it off, in which case I might talk for a massive… wait for it… 3-5 minutes.) I use the same line each time, and the conversation is almost always exactly the same.

*“Hey, I know this is random but you’re hot and I had to say hi.” \*smile\**\[She’ll say something, usually a smile and a thankyou\]*“You single?”*\[If she says no, I leave. If she says yes, then carry on\]*“Cool. I’m Andy. \*Shake hands\*. What are you* *up to today?”*\[Small-talk for 30 seconds\]\*“Lemme grab your number, we’ll grab a drink.”\*That’s it. Done. 1 minute max. Surely you can do that every single day, right?

# But I don’t have enough time! I’m a super busy person, I can’t be hitting on girls!

You and I know that’s bullshit – you’re just scared to talk to girls (which isn’t anything to be ashamed of). But I’ll play along and pretend you’re actually as busy as you say you are. In that case, just say this to girls:

*“Hey, you’re hot and I had to say hi. I’m in a massive rush though – wanna give me your number and we’ll grab a drink sometime?”*

10 seconds. Literally 10 seconds. No excuses – **you can definitely do that once a day.**  
And if you’re scared of other people seeing you hit on girls – I’ve got an answer to that [here](https://killyourinnerloser.com/other-people-seeing-you-hit-on-girls/).

# Join Me

Join me – do 1 approach a day with me. **Write a comment below letting me know you’re committing to the habit with** **me**. Even if you only do it for a month, you’ll find it really helps make approaching more of “who you are” thing, rather than something you have to push yourself to do. **It’ll become a habit**.

Hitting on 1 girl a day is like a conveyor belt in a factory that just keeps on moving, never stopping. 1 girl a day means you’re keeping the wheels constantly turning, and by keeping things turning, you’ll inevitably get some numbers, then dates, then sex. It’ll feel like girls “accidentally” fall into your lap, from just 1-2 minutes of minor effort a day. **You’re doing the 1 approach a day** ***anyway***\*\*, and if you get sex out if it, that’s a nice bonus.\*\*

It’ll eventually feel like you’re getting laid *for free,* without doing any work.

352,Grandpa Glen's Guide To Girls,153,pl5zvs,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/pl5zvs/grandpa_glens_guide_to_girls/,41,"Listen when you’ve been on the road as long as I have and met as many women as I have in hotel rooms, you’ve had a hotel bill you for damages. It happens and it’s a natural part of being on the road with floozies. Freelancers, streetwalkers, and working girls aren’t the most careful with their dietary choices before they get called by a John to turn a trick, so let’s just say ol' Grandpa Glen has a few tricks up his foreskin. I’ve been in the game longer than most of you youngsters have been around, and I know a thing or two about a dame and her intestinal tract. If the deepthroat facefuck session gets a little chunky or if things get sticky, command her to grab a towel and don’t be afraid to flip the mattress. Simple as that. Just flip that old girl over, put your hat on, pick up your briefcase and get the show back on the road.


Back in my day, when our boys were lighting up the jungle we used to call ‘em slants. These days I think the politically correct term is escort. When in the Orient you gotta speak oriental. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. It’s just common decency really. I know a lot of you boys never had a dad to come home to and never got around to learning about the finer things in life. Heck, half you kids won’t even know what a good whisky, horse race and a cigar can do for a man’s soul. That’s why Grandpa Glen decided to stop by and teach you boys how to be a man in a man’s word.


I’m gonna teach you how to speak a nips language in the sack. Boom boom, or Full Service (FS) is making woopie. Yum yum or BlowJob (BJ) is when she gives up that mouth. These days the youngsters call it dome, top, sloppy toppy, (see, ol Glen’s still hip!) Now the Feds have cracked down on a lot of preteen action,and honestly I support them for it. Tax dollars at work. But if you find your call girl pulling out a graphing calculator or doing homework, double check that ID of hers to make sure you’re not violating international customs by feeding the kids your kids, if you catch my drift.


In Asia, the facial features can be a bit soft and the physiques on the petite side, so Grandpa Glen always abides by the two apple rule. This technique is tried and true and it’s been passed down from better men than me. Always look for an Adam’s apple and always grope the groin area (with consent wink wink) to feel for anything fruity in the trousers. The last thing you want is your boner befouled by a surprise gender reveal. And the last thing you want to see is a feminine penis hanging over a ladyboy’s testicles. There are two roads a man can tread while sewing his wild oats in the Orient: “Don’t ask don’t tell” and “Better Safe than Sorry.” I started off on the former camp and through time and experience and developed the maturity to be in the second. With these tools in your arsenal, your experience with the ladies will be drastically improved.


Now don’t get me wrong, hotels and flights really put a pinch on the pocketbook. Massage parlors are a convenient option for when you don’t have the time and or money to go all out. at the massage parlor, you always have to pay the house, but if you want to end your relaxing back rub with some good old rub and tug, you have to perform what’s called “the flip”, and when you do the flip, pull out the tip.


From here your options are unlimited. CBJ, (condom blowjob) if you’re a sissy, BBBJ, (Bareback blowjob) for the veterans, CFS (condom full service) for the lames, and BBFS (Bareback full service) for the adventurous vagina explorers. When receiving a handy J from a masseuse, your options range from tits play, ass play, and tits and ass play. My only rule at the massage parlors are no kissing. Nothing limps my erection like a genuine emotional connection. I mean that. The best place to find reviews of erotic massage parlors is TugFinder No charge, thank ol’ Gramps later.",1631219519.0

Lets start with girl 1, HB 8.5 probably the hottest that I talked to today. Hit her with the basic ""hey I thought you were cute"", and went on to talk about what she was up to for a little bit. After that I asked for her number and she said she had a boyfriend. I see alot of people on here keep pushing when they say that but I decided to just say next and carry on with my day.

A couple minutes later I see another girl, blonde hair blue eyes walking down the street. I tell her hey and she keeps walking.. I say it again a little louder and she takes acouple more steps (like 5 feet away from me) and she turns around and says what with a straight ass face. Must have been a rough day so I just said I was saying hi and have a good day. Next.

I had class and I wanted to get at least one more approach in before I left campus, and I say yet another blonde hair blue eye girl she looked like she was in a rush tho... I stop her and say ""hey do you know where the... I actually dont need directions I just thought you were cute and wanted to see whats up with you"". She seemed interested and responsive, but she said she was going to a marketing club and I told her how my freshman year I went to a biz school and how I transfered to the school I'm currently at. Then I went for the close and told her I dont wanna hold her up so I asked for her number, told her I'll hit her up later, and that was the end of my cold approach journey for day one.

What I learned and questions I have:

Girls arent scary, but I still cannot approach when theres alot of people around. My beta self tells me everyone around me is gonna hear me call her cute and judge me. I need to work on getting over that and I guess the only way to do that is by doing it...

I hate the I thought you were cute so I wanted to say hi. I want to move on to just being able to bullshit around and truly enjoy doing it. All of these interactions were less than 2 minutes. 

I'm gonna hit up girl 3 tmw and see what shes doing for the weekend, since I usually have a party or bar to go to.

I'm writing this so I'm able to learn from my mistakes and see how much better at it I can become. Any advice or anything is appreciated

TLDR: Approached 3 girls today, got 1 number. Will be doing it every day from now on and will hopefully get a lay.",1631140083.0

**""This is a new throwaway account, but I'm weeally weaaally redpill! Make an exception to the new user filter just for meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!""**

No.

The new user filter is there for a reason. And we're not going to make extra work for ourselves circumventing it because you pinkie-swear you're just the nicest person evar. If you're serious about using a new account, put in the time.

**""How DARE you ban me you incel faggot cuck child beta loser! I demand to be reinstated at once, or I will make this public to all 15K people in PurplePillDebate! Fear the bad publicity! Ahahahahahaahahahahh!""**

Maybe you told an EC he was a ""faggot"". Maybe you wrote a long moral lecture about how it's wrong to sex up married girls. Maybe you told another user to ""go kill himself"".

Or maybe I just fucking clicked on the wrong name. It's happened.

But all of that doesn't matter now, because being an ass in modmail gets you banned, too.

**""Why did you remove my post?? I thought it was good!""**

For the love of Invisible Space Jesus, WHAT post? I remove ten or twenty posts a day. Who are you? What you talking about? Give me a link to follow, for fuck's sake.

**""Here's a six page description of a problem I have! Please please please help me!""**

We did help you, asshat. We created an entire group of subreddits, for the sole purpose of helping you, and we tended them, and cared for them until they grew to a quarter of a million people, all available to share their insights and experiences with you. But nnoooooooooo, that's not good enough for you, you have to get personal attention from us, in your own private white-glove service chat, because you're a special snowflake, and you have special needs, and mommy always said you were special. Except you're not.

So fuck off.

**""What do you think of this post? {Paste six pages.} I think it will change the entire world forever!""**

We think it doesn't belong in modmail, because posts don't go in modmail, genius.

""{You/we/the sky fairies} should make a post about {thing}! Here's a link! Get cracking!""

Be the change you wish to see in the world. Start writing. Impress us all.

**""I'm going to start a chat server, and advertise it on your group, and there's nothing you can do to stop me!""**

You are not going to doxx our users, and just watch us.

**""I can just make a new account!""**

That's nice. We can ban with two clicks, in five seconds. Have fun getting each new account over the new user filter!

**""Hey, what are the time/karma/other requirements on the new user filter?""**

If we wanted you to know, we would have told you.

**""I am a dark triad personality! Fear me! Give in to my demands!""**

What, and you think we're not an entire allied pack of intelligent high-functioning psychopaths? Bring it, kid.

**""You are a bunch of psychopaths! Disband this misogynist group at once, or I shall report you to {reddit/google/the FCC/Nancy Pelosi/the karma police/my mom}!""**

What, you think we're literally a bunch of psychopaths? Lighten up, kid.

**""The Brood Mothers! They SING to us! Can you not hear their song? Soon the oceans will rise up, and the Space Rabbits shall return from the Purple Sector!""**

Take your medication.

It’s important to remember that, no matter what she *says*, when things go bad, she wants you to be a fucking *MAN*.  

Years ago, a woman I knew was dating a guy who, well, he just wasn’t the most masculine fellow in the world.  So they are talking and she says, *“What would you do if you heard someone breaking into the house?”*  Him: *“I’d make noise so that they’d realize there was someone at home.”*

This, gents, is the Wrong Answer.

Me: *“Wut?  Not ‘Go bash the guy over the head’?”*

Her: *“I wouldn’t have to ask YOU.”*

This was a test, and he failed it.

Correct Move: Look at her like she said something stupid and, *“I’d go smash him over the head, dafuq do you think I’d do?  Then I’d come back in here, rip your panties off and ravish you!”* – then proceed directly to the “ravishing” part.

Carry yourself with “Amused Mastery” – you are in command of the situation, and you can handle it with ease.  How would James Bond handle things?  The Bond films – especially those starring Sean Connery – are a master class in Amused Mastery.  Alternatively, if being witty isn’t your thing, then the quiet confidence of Jason Statham might be.

Women want to feel small and feminine. It is imprinted on their brains.  The more that you do it, the more they will like you, even if they don’t know why.

This is why I recommend physicality with women.  In a Dominant – not “domineering” – way.  Done correctly, it taps something primordial in their brains.  I’ve talked about this on the TRP podcasts – I think in the first ones I did with Wr1tten.


**Pick Her Up After You Pick Her Up** 

At some point early on, ideally, on the first date/meeting/whatever, find a reason to lift her off of her feet.  The last time I did this there I was chatting with a girl on the sidewalk – we were meeting up so not just a rando – and there was a lot of foot traffic coming towards us, so I wrapped an arm around her, lightly lifted her off of her feet, took a step or two out of the way and gently deposited her on her feet.  I could tell she was surprised at how easily I did this.  She felt (correctly) that she was 100% under my control, physically, and it made her feel small and feminine, to my strong and masculine.  Polarity is your friend, lads.


**Uncle Vaz’ Patented ‘Ankle Drag’ Maneuver** 

When you are having sex with a girl, at some point, when you want to change positions, get up and drag her across the bed by her ankle. It results in tingles, and if you can do it with ease – firm grip, no yanking, drawing her steadily into position – the more tingly she will get. The first time you do it, at a minimum, they *WILL* mention during post-coital pillow talk. completely under your control and their subconscious goes *PING! - “This is a strong, dominant, masculine man!”*  Why?  Because you are exerting control over them, AND they are getting fucked.

Pussy Tingle Generator Level: *Niagara Falls*


**Bonus Tip, Heldover:**  Bloopers claw their faces off when I say this, so I’m going to say it, again: I will often tell a girl smth along the lines of, *“I will meet you at 8pm.  The dress code is {x}.  And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.”*  Now, Bloopers (and some of you guys) will say *“OMG!  Uncle Vaz!  That’s so ‘cringe’! OMGEEEEE!”*  First, saying ‘cringe’ is the new cringe.  Second, I’ve never had a girl break a date over that, mostly because I’ve built attraction and established my Frame and a ‘mildly subversive’ vibe.  And more often than not, it results in her wearing pretty underwear for me, that I get to see, and remove.  Even if it starts out with, *“How dare he?!  Who does he think he is?!  I’m going to wear my prettiest pair in case I want to flash him later!”*


**What if There Was a Zombie Apocalypse?”**

A woman I know jokingly mentioned the other day that men love it when you ask them what their plan is as to how they would handle a zombie apocalypse, and *“Some guys have worked out some elaborate plans.”*  

Me: *“Their answers have nothing to do with zombies, and everything to do what How They Will Handle Things When Shit Goes Bad.  There won’t be any zombies, but there will be people walking around ACTING like zombies, and you can be that, when that happens, their wives, girlfriends and female family members will EXPECT them to Have a Fucking Plan.”*


Her: *“?”*

Me: *“You live in California.  Sure, it’s beautiful, but there are forest fires, earthquakes, mudslides and maybe tsunamis.  Kind of Mother Nature’s ‘El Sucko Combo Platter.’  If the worst happens, you expect your husband to be able to take care of you and your kids, right?”*

Her: *“Yep!”*

Me: *“And THAT’S why we think about these things.  Ta-DA!”*

Not every girl will ask you about this stuff, but if they do, the subtext is, *“You can protect me, right?”*

**Uncle Vaz’ Numero Uno Survival Tip:** The only time you don’t need more ammo is if you are swimming or on fire.


**Sexist is the Sexiest: Women – Even Feminist Women – Prefer ‘Benevolently Sexist’ Men”**


I’m not making this up – [Believe The Science](https://archive.is/F8Clb)!  There is some gobbled gook focusing on *“muh CHIVALRY!”* and such and about how they can get the “good” parts without the “bad” parts – stuff will like such as being feminine and cooperative, because that’s “submissive”…du-uh.  

That includes everything from showing deference to up to and including rapekink, consensual non-consent and being “slave girls - **obviously these need to be discussed and agreed on during non-sexy times, and safe/ease words utilized, limits established and respected, etc.**

The next time it’s appropriate, ask a girl you are fucking/chatting up smth like *“I’ve heard that, for women, ‘feeling desired’ IS the orgasm…is that true?”*  She will give you whatever opinion she has, and she will think to herself, *“This guy gets it.”*

This is why women want you to have a plan from everything from *“What if someone was trying to break into the house?”* to *“What if there’s a zombie apocalypse?”*.  You are the Captain and the [Captain Always Knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV79EIZVuHQ)...and she’s [Just a Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHzOOQfhPFg).

*But Uncle Vaz!  The Bloopers say I should just ‘Be Myself’.  Should I?”*

Men are sex-motivated.  If “just being yourself” or “Being a Nice Guy” was the Pathway to Pussy, then TRP would be all about how you should totes not lift and just play vidja and smoke up all day, and then take milady out and blow all of your wages for the week on escargot and a bottle of DRC at *“Le Queef”* because then she will definitely give you that 10th stamp on your “Nice Guy” card and say *“Finally!  Now I can give you all the sex you deserve!”*

Yeah, that’s not how shit works, so that’s not what TRP is about. 

You should focus on becoming the *best version* of yourself that you can be.  Hit the House of Iron, eat clean, take your vitamins, say your prayers and LURN Game.

**Fun Fact:** On the rare occasion where I’m surprised with a shit test or similar, I often say the most sexist thing that pops into my head that I can ‘legally’ say.  Ex: *“Little spoons don’t ask questions,”* or *“Women should be felt and not heard.”*  Or my favorite: [Man Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcNGYRKBfHA).


**Takeaways**

-Carry yourself with an air of “Amused Mastery” or at least “Quiet Confidence.”

-Kino is Key.

-Sexist is the Sexiest: Girls dig benevolently sexist men.  Her pussy wants a *Man*, not the kind of man who belongs to a club, but the kind with a club that belongs to him.",1631024220.0

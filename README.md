# The RedPill Project
I created this repository for my PHD thesis.

## Scope
My primary aim with my PHD project is to investigate the RedPill community. 

The two key goals of this study is

1) Making a topic modelling to discover mostly discussed topics among the group
2) Making a network analysis between the Redpill community on reddit and the other subreddits. 

## Methodology
I will explain further here.

## GitHub Repository

### Data
Contains two .csv files. They are basically the same data but with different numbers of posts retrieved from the API. Scrape_data.py contains the code for fetching data from the API. test.ipynb is there for testing purposes.

### Notebooks
Currently I only explored the topic modelling. I will continue working on the project.
